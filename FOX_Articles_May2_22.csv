""At the start of the conflict, Russia committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65 percent of its entire ground combat strength,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defence said in a tweet. ""It is likely that more than a quarter of these units have now been rendered combat ineffective.""

The startling statistic comes as Russia’s bloody invasion of Ukraine is in its 68th day. Prior to the assault from Vladimir Putin’s army, it was estimated that Moscow assembled around 150,000 soldiers to participate in the war.

More than a quarter of troops that Russia sent to fight in Ukraine are now believed to be ""combat ineffective,"" the United Kingdom announced Monday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal is ""the extermination of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian,"" Zelenskyy claimed.

Zelenskyy added: ""It is no coincidence that they are waging a so-called total war to destroy all living things, after which only the burned ruins of entire cities and villages remain.""

""It is no coincidence that the Russian occupiers are creating so-called 'filtration camps' on Ukrainian land through which thousands of our Ukrainian citizens are passing,"" he said. ""Where our people are killed, tortured and raped. It is no coincidence that the occupiers capture civilians and take them hostage or deport them as free labor.""

The Ukrainian president then compared the actions of Russia's military in his country to the way German Nazis attacked the Jewish population during World War II.

""Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy,"" Zelenskyy started in his address. ""Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II.""

During an address Monday evening, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's ongoing invasion of his country will result in their ""self-destruction in every sense of the word.""

Zelenskyy: Russia's goal is 'the extermination of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian'

Ukraine's military also prevented a Russian attack in Kherson, as they sought to take a military observation post, the Kyiv Independent reported.

At least 122 Russian troops were killed during a battle in southern Ukraine on May 2, according to a report.

The game-changing impact of those arms is exactly what President Joe Biden hopes to spotlight as he visits a Lockheed Martin plant in Alabama on Tuesday that builds the portable Javelin anti-tank weapons that have played a crucial role in Ukraine.

The planes take off almost daily from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware — hulking C-17s loaded up with Javelins, Stingers, howitzers and other material being hustled to Eastern Europe to resupply Ukraine’s military in its fight against Russia.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Monday that 3,153 civilians have died there since Feb. 24, Reuters reports .

The tragic figure comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine has stretched to 68 days.

The number of civilians killed in Ukraine during Russia’s invasion has now surpassed 3,000, the United Nations announced Monday.

""Our objective is to reopen the embassy, to have our diplomats there, not just traveling back and forth, but present in the country,"" Psaki said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said the White House has ""no plans in the works at this time,"" but said officials will ""continue to assess.""

The White House said President Biden ""would love to visit Ukraine,"" but as of Monday there are ""no plans in the works"" for him to travel to the country.

""So when they say ‘How can Nazification exist if we’re Jewish?’ In my opinion, Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn’t mean absolutely anything. For some time we have heard from the Jewish people that the biggest antisemites were Jewish,"" he said, speaking to the station in Russian, dubbed over by an Italian translation.

The comments, made during an interview with Italian television, prompted Israel to summon the Russian ambassador. Lavrov made the remarks when he was asked why Russia feels it needs to ""denazify"" Ukraine if the country's own president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is Jewish. Moscow has repeatedly used the claim to justify its invasion of the country.

Israel is demanding an apology after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday claimed that Adolf Hitler had Jewish roots, calling the remarks ""unforgivable and outrageous.""

""I would just tell that we continue to see minimal at best progress by the Russians in the Donbas,"" the official told reporters.

The remark comes as Russia is now on day 68 of its invasion of Ukraine, with its military focusing on capturing the eastern parts of the war-torn country.

A senior U.S. official said Monday that Russia’s military has been making ""minimal progress at best"" in eastern Ukraine because the ""Ukrainians have really been resisting quite well.""

The operation to remove the civilians is being coordinated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. It comes after the plant has suffered weeks of attacks by Russian forces, killing an unknown number of people and wounding at least 600.

The first 100 of roughly 1,000 civilians, mostly women and children, have been evacuated from the sprawling plant where the citizens have been hiding out from Russian attacks since the war started two months ago. They are expected to arrive in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles northwest of the city.

The admission comes after it was reported Friday that 29-year-old Major Stepan Tarabalka, who some had credited with being the Ghost of Kyiv, was shot down and killed in battle last month.

""Ghost of Kiev is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" the Ukrainian Air Force said in a Facebook post Saturday.

The Ukrainian military officially ended speculation about the ""Ghost of Kyiv,"" admitting that the legendary pilot is actually a myth.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Anastasiia Dembytska, a Ukrainian civilian who was evacuated from the steel plant, said it took her 18 hours to enter Zaporizhzhia, after crossing multiple barriers.

Russian officials claim these individuals will be allowed to continue to Ukraine, while Ukrainian officials say their citizens have been forcibly removed.

The Associated Press reported at least some of the 100 people who were evacuated from the plant were taken to a village controlled by pro-Russia separatists, instead of Zaporizhzhia.

The first group of civilians that were evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where they were trapped for weeks, have not yet arrived to their intended destination of Zaporizhzhia, according to a report.

Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, described the difficulty of reaching the wounded still trapped under the steel plant.

These evacuees will be transported to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles northwest of Mariupol, where the U.N. and the Red Cross will ensure their continued safety.

Civilians who have lived beneath the plant did so in horrible conditions, often with little to no food or water; and, many were suffering untreated injuries.

""Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vital corridor has started working. For the first time there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than a hundred civilians have already been evacuated - women and children first of all.""

The Ukrainian leader said more than 100 woman and children have been safely evacuated from the plant.

He called the situation “very complex” and would not give further details. Up to 1,000 civilians are believed to be hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant that is the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians.

U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu told The Associated Press on Sunday that the effort to bring people out of sprawling Azovstal steel plant was being done in collaboration with the International Committee for the Red Cross and in coordination with Ukrainian and Russian officials.

The United Nations has confirmed that an operation to evacuate people from a steel plant in the bombed-out Ukrainian city of Mariupol is underway.

Germany has resisted such an embargo, but government sources told German news agency dpa on Sunday that Chancellor Olaf Scholz will back the embargo.

Ambassadors will reportedly table the proposal at an ambassadors summit in Brussels on Wednesday, with expectations to approve the embargo by the end of next week.

Germany will support the European embargo of Russian oil, marking another significant turnaround in the nation’s position as the invasion of Ukraine continues.

Russia's military has already lost more than 23,000 troops since the invasion started on Feb. 24, according to the Ukrainian government.

He added: “The Russian commanders are lying to their soldiers when they tell them they can expect to be held seriously responsible for refusing to fight and then also don’t tell them, for example, that the Russian army is preparing additional refrigerator trucks for storing the bodies. They don’t tell them about the new losses the generals expect.""

“Every Russian soldier can still save his own life. It’s better for you to survive in Russia than to perish on our land,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautioned potential Russian recruits from joining the war effort during his nightly address Saturday, telling them their military leaders were not telling them the whole truth.

Some reports, however, dispute Tarabalka's identity as the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" and instead claim the online persona embodies the whole of the Ukrainian Air Force and the resolve of each fighter pilot.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posthumously awarded Tarabalka with the title Hero of Ukraine, Ukraine’s top medal for bravery, according to the report.

The ""Ghost of Kyiv"" persona grew in popularity online in the first weeks of the war as the legendary fighter pilot was credited with shooting down at least 40 Russian fighter jets. His identity was not previously been revealed.

Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29, was killed after he was shot down during a combat mission on March 13, The Times of London reported Friday.

After Russia suffered heavy losses over the past two months, Zelenskyy said Russia has been forced to recruit ""new people"" with ""little motivation"" and ""little combat experience.""

""But they do not stop,"" he added.

""The occupiers are accumulating additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country. They built up reinforcements in the Kharkiv region, trying to increase pressure in Donbas,"" Zelenskyy said, noting Russia has ""already lost more than 23,000 soldiers.""

In his nightly address Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's military was gathering reinforcements for ""new attacks"" in his country.

Jolie spent time at a boarding school where she talked with students and took photos with them while adding that ""she promised she would come again.”

She was very moved by (the children’s) stories,” Kozytskyy wrote. “One girl was even able to privately tell Ms. Jolie about a dream she’d had.”

The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a looming Russian offensive, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.“

According to Maksym Kozytskyy, Jolie — who has been a UNHCR Special Envoy for Refugees since 2011 — had come to speak with displaced people who have found refuge in Lviv, including children undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in early April.

A Ukrainian military official warned Saturday that Russia is continuing to bolster its forces in the eastern Donbas region and is intensifying its offensive measures. ""

Ukrainian troops visited the area of the alleged attack and found a damaged bus with no people aboard, but with “traces of blood” in the area. The second bus has not been found.

A volunteer who managed to escape after Russians allegedly started shooting at two busses in the village of Popasna on Friday. Communication with the driver went dead, according to Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske.

The head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration (RDA) announced Saturday that a bus used to help evacuate civilians and carry humanitarian aid had gone missing.

The units, which previously operated in north-east Ukraine as part of the siege on Kyiv, are ""likely suffering from weakened morale,"" the ministry said.

""Shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain,"" the report said. ""A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass despite localized improvements.""

The Russian military has redeployed ""depleted and disparate units"" from across Ukraine in an effort to maintain its Donbas activities, The British Ministry of Defense said Saturday.

""Russian troops manage to be even more cynical than the Nazis 80 years ago,"" he said. ""At that time, the invaders did not say that it was the Mariupol residents and the defenders of the city who shelled and killed themselves.""

Zelenskyy said there were operational differences between Russian forces today and the Nazis during World War II, but said Moscow’s persistent lies are what separates the two.

This outcome, Zelenskyy said, was “becoming more and more obvious to Russia” as the United States, European countries and other nations continue to support Ukraine.

After 65 days of combat, Russian officials continue to say they are attempting to denuclearize Ukraine, clear it of alleged bioweapons, and prevent the country from being able to mount a future offensive attack.

When Russia first invaded its neighbor to the southwest on Feb. 24, Russian officials said it was doing so as a ""special operation"" to ""denazify"" and disarm Ukraine.

Lavrov also said if the U.S. and NATO were ""truly"" interested in ending the war, they would stop supplying Ukraine with weapons.

""By publicly expressing support for the Kyiv regime, the NATO countries are doing everything to prevent ending of the operation through political agreements,"" Lavrov said, as Reuters reported.

In remarks published early Saturday morning local time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said his country's invasion of Ukraine will not end until the United States and NATO countries stop aiding Ukraine.

""But the Russian troops manage to be even more cynical than the Nazis 80 years ago. At that time, the invaders did not say that it was the Mariupol residents and the defenders of the city who shelled and killed themselves.""

In at least one instance, Zelenskyy said the Russian military was worse than Nazis.

The Ukrainian president then said Russia was turning his country into ""a Russian concentration camp"" and said these invaders ""differ insignificantly from what the Nazis did in the occupied territory of Eastern Europe.""

""If the Russian invaders succeed in realizing their plans, at least in part, they will still have enough artillery and aircraft to destroy the entire Donbas. Just as they destroyed Mariupol,"" Zelenskyy said.

The war is not without its losses, as both military units and civilians alike are facing Russian bombings, he said.

""The situation in the Kharkiv region is tough. But our military, our intelligence, have important tactical success,"" he added.

""We are beating the occupiers in all directions where they are trying to advance,"" Zelenskyy said Friday evening.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address that his country continues to see success after 65 days of warring with Russia.

Editor's note: A previous version of this post stated 900 bodies were discovered in a mass grave. Other reports have since indicated Zelenskyy misspoke.

The president said that 900 bodies had been found in the area, but the spokesperson clarified that the number referred to the number of dead found so far around the capital, and authorities are still working to determine the total number of civilians killed during Russia’s assault.

A spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed a new mass grave had been found in the area around Kyiv on Friday.

He said it was obvious Russia was using gas as a political tool.

“Alternative supplies are available, and Bulgaria hopes that alternative routes and supplies will also be secured at EU level,” Nikolov said. He added that Poland and Lithuania are in the same situation .

Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov said the country has enough gas for at least a month a day after Russia said it would cut off supplies because the country has refused to pay in rubles.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on Tuesday to discuss nuclear safety on the 36th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.

He said Ukraine understands Russia has been in Transnistria for years and know their ""capabilities,"" but the ""Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for this and are not afraid of them.""

""We clearly understand that this is one of the steps of the Russian Federation,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The special services are working there. It's not just about fake news. The goal is obvious - to destabilize the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that the country's troops are ready for an escalation by Russia in the breakaway Moldovan state Transnistria, which he said Russia is trying to destabilize.

European leaders said they would not comply with the rubles requirement, arguing that it violated the terms of contracts and their sanctions against Russia over its military aggression against Ukraine. Only Hungary has agreed to Putin’s demands.

The suspensions, which would take effect Wednesday, would be the first since Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that ""unfriendly"" foreign buyers would have to pay the state-owned Gazprom in rubles instead of dollars and euros.

Polish and Bulgarian officials said Tuesday that Russian energy company Gazprom informed them it was suspending natural gas supplies to the two countries for their refusal to pay in Russian rubles.

Russia on Tuesday once again escalated the threat of nuclear warfare amid its illegal campaign in Ukraine by alleging that with the support of the U.S. Kyiv is developing nuclear weapons.

1,Johnny Depp and Amber Heard defamation trial: Amber Heard to testify as early as Wednesday,"Amber Heard sent her private nurse Erin Falati photos of her bruised face May 22, 2016 -- a few hours after she alleges that Johnny Depp bashed her in the eye with a cellphone.

Falati said in a pre-recorded deposition played for jurors Monday that Heard sent her four photos at 12:36 a.m. showing red marks around her right eye.

But the nurse did not include any information about the texts in her treatment notes, Heard's lawyer Adam Nadelhaft pointed out during questioning.

Depp's legal team has accused Heard of faking her injuries in retaliation for him wanting to end their marriage.

""Client states she cannot deal with the negative media publicity she has received from the divorce she requested from JD,"" Falati wrote in a medical note memorializing a text from Heard requesting the sleeping aid Ambien.

By the next month, Falati had stopped treating Heard and started treating Depp. He allegedly told her on April 7 that he was blindsided by Heard filing for divorce.

""Client states that he was not aware that AH [Amber Heard] wanted a divorce and expresses confusion that AH [Amber Heard] wants to terminate the marriage,” Falati wrote in her notes.

The alleged statement by Depp appears to contradict his testimony on the stand.

He told jurors that he requested the divorce May 20, 2016, the day his mother died -- but was taken aback when he learned that Heard had beaten him to the punch and filed three days later.

The rest of Falati's deposition, which was recorded on Feb. 4, is expected to be played Tuesday morning when court resumes.",https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-court-case

The Supreme Court is poised to strike down Roe v. Wade, according to an unprecedented leak of a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito.

The draft leak obtained by Politico was written in early February. It was not immediately clear if it has been rewritten or revised. Fox News is not being waived off the story.

Until an official opinion is signed and released by the Court, Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land. Drafts circulate and change, as do votes.

Should Roe v. Wade be overturned, abortions would be left for the states to decide.

MSNBC host Rachel Maddow offered a prediction of what will happen in America following the unprecedented leak from the Supreme Court showing the majority of justices intend on overturning Roe v. Wade.

Politico rocked the political landscape on Monday night by publishing the first draft of what appears to be the majority opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito that could mark the end the federal preservation of abortion and leave such laws to be determined on a state level.

SUPREME COURT SET TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, LEAKED DRAFT OPINION SHOWS: REPORT

""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division,"" Alito wrote, according to Politico, referring to the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision that upheld the precedent. ""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled… It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.""

During her primetime handoff with MSNBC colleague Chris Hayes, Maddow began by expressing shock at the first-ever leak of a Supreme Court opinion draft.

Maddow then pivoted to reporting that Republicans on Capitol Hill, with the assumption that a red wave in the November midterms will give them the majority in Congress, are mulling legislation that would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, something Maddow says is ""effectively a complete ban on abortion"" since pro-choice critics argue many women don't know they are pregnant until after six weeks.

RACHEL MADDOW ANNOUNCES SHE'S ROLLING BACK MSNBC SHOW, WILL HOST ONLY MONDAY NIGHTS STARTING IN MAY

""If the ultimate ruling from the court is going to look anything like this- and we're going into a midterm season where the Republicans are poised to take the House and the Senate, then, you know, President Biden is still President Biden, and he would presumably veto such a measure,"" Maddow said. ""But if in the event that we had a Republican president and 2024, that's where we'd be. We'd be at, you know, South America-style nationwide abortion ban in America.""

Hayes agreed, asserting ""it would be the first bill"" GOP lawmakers pass in Congress if they regain control.

""I mean… this is like a four-number Sudoku. This isn't a very hard puzzle, right?"" Maddow said. ""This is, in terms of people figuring out what the stakes are of their vote in November in terms of the midterms putting whichever party in control of either house of Congress, will among other things determine whether or not we're about to become a country that bans abortion nationwide.""

""But even more acutely, there used to be until very recently, there was a taboo on saying that a woman or even a child who was raped or who was the victim of incest- at least they wouldn't be forced by the government to give birth against their will, to carry that pregnancy to term and give birth against their will, that increasingly- literally including girls who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest, they aren't- those exceptions are disappearing one by one with each passing week every time a Republican legislature takes up this issue.""

6,AOC botches facts in viral tweet attacking Texas abortion law,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

""Squad"" leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. ,botched the facts while attacking Texas' hotly debated abortion law in a tweet that quickly went viral among progressives.

Ocasio-Cortez made the claim in a Friday tweet where she appeared to respond to Elon Musk's suggestion that the Democratic Party has moved too far to the left.

""‘The extreme left is taking over’ WHERE. In Texas, Republicans passed a law allowing rapists to sue their victims for getting an abortion,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

OCASIO-CORTEZ WRONGLY SUGGESTS SHE REPRESENTS MORE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS THAN JOE MANCHIN

""Can anyone name a ‘far left’ policy that extreme implemented anywhere?"" she continued. ""We can’t even get our party to import cheaper RXs from Canada."" The congresswoman ended her tweet with an acronym for ""f--- outta here.""

While Ocasio-Cortez's tweet quickly received tens of thousands of likes and retweets, it was factually inaccurate.

The Texas Heartbeat Act, also known as Senate Bill 8, was originally signed into law in May 2021 and took effect in September. The law empowers private citizens to sue anyone suspected of aiding or abetting an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually after six weeks of pregnancy.

The law is one of the strictest in the nation, and allows individuals to sue a person who facilitates an abortion — such as the doctors that provide them.

Contrary to Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, however, women who obtain abortions after fetal cardiac activity has been detected are specifically exempted from the law.

Ocasio-Cortez's office didn't immediately return an email from Fox News Digital asking whether the congresswoman plans to correct the widely-circulated, but inaccurate, tweet.

A federal court dismissed all challenges Tuesday to a provision in the Texas abortion law.

The U.S. 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the legal challenge against the six-week abortion ban back to the state Supreme Court with orders to dismiss all challenges.

In March, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that state medical licensing clinics don't have the authority to enforce the law. Weeks earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the matter, leaving abortion providers with a narrow path to victory and an uphill battle.

Since taking effect, abortions have plummeted in Texas, one of several states dominated by conservatives that have passed similar restrictions on abortions.

The U.S. Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June in a case that gives its conservative majority a chance to roll back abortion rights or even overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v.

In addition to the reimbursement policy, Amazon has returned to standard sick leave policies. Starting Monday, all U.S. employees will receive up to five days of excused, unpaid time for a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, regardless of vaccination status.

Accrued time may be used to cover a COVID-19 related absence and should be reported in Amazon's A to Z platform. With rapid testing widely available, the company will no longer excuse time while waiting for a test result.

Amazon has also discontinued an incentive that offers employees a $40 bonus for each vaccine dose they get and will no longer send site-wide notifications of positive COVID-19 cases at its facilities unless required by law. In addition, face masks are optional for Amazon's unvaccinated and vaccinated employees, except where required by law.

8,Florida mother shares powerful story of adopting abortion survivor,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Terri Kellogg, mother of an abortion survivor, shared her story on ""The Ingraham Angle Town Hall"" in Orlando, Florida, of how it had been placed on her heart to adopt Hope Hoffman after surviving an attempted abortion.

TERRI KELLOGG: When we decided that we wanted to adopt, I was going to be a special education teacher, so I was open to special needs children and I knew that they were hard to place. And that's how I was open to when I heard about Hope and her special needs through this Christian adoption agency. … It had been placed on my heart. And she's been a blessing. It's been what we know, and it's been difficult, but I mean, being a mother is difficult, period. But the blessings have far outweighed it. God, he's just opened doors for us to share our story, which, you know, is it takes a lot for someone to understand exactly what happened.

And when we share it, like what happened to her head and we tell her, when we tell people, when she was 10 weeks gestation, like you had said that, which would have been about the size of this little baby, first trimester. And that's when her birth mom went and had an abortion and thought it had worked and it didn't. And she left not knowing she was still pregnant. And then she felt movement at five-and-a-half months and then she chose life. She chose adoption and didn't know anything was wrong with her. And then she delivered early and then they knew they were going to have to place her with this special needs adoption agency.

Naomi Judd died by suicide following a longtime struggle with mental health, according to a new report.

The country legend took her own life on Saturday, multiple sources confirmed to People magazine.

A rep for Judd told Fox News Digital on Monday: ""There is an investigation by law enforcement and the coroner’s office.""

Wynonna and Ashley Judd announced their mother's death at the age of 76 on Saturday with a heartbreaking statement posted to social media.

It read: ""Today we sisters experienced a tragedy. We lost our beautiful mother to the disease of mental illness. We are shattered. We are navigating profound grief and know that as we loved her, she was loved by her public. We are in unknown territory.""

On Monday, Public Information Officer Williamson told Us Weekly in a statement: ""It’s an open investigation, currently we are not releasing any reports, 911 calls or bodycam or dashcam footage. This is a death investigation which is ongoing. There is no police jurisdiction in that area, so only the sheriff’s department attended. We are awaiting information from the detectives from the criminal investigation division.""

Naomi and Wynonna Judd were among the most popular duos — The Judds — of the 1980s, scoring 14 No. 1 hits during their nearly three-decade career. The Judds’ hits included ""Love Can Build a Bridge"" in 1990, ""Mama He’s Crazy"" in 1984, ""Why Not Me"" in 1984, ""Turn It Loose"" in 1988, ""Girls Night Out"" in 1985, ""Rockin’ With the Rhythm of the Rain"" in 1986 and ""Grandpa"" in 1986.

Before her death, the Grammy Award-winning artist released a memoir that detailed her battle with mental illness.

""River of Time: My Descent into Depression and How I Emerged with Hope"" came out in 2016 from Hachette/Center Street.

In the book, Naomi described experiencing the ""boulder-like weight of my severe treatment-resistant depression and terrifying panic attacks."" She described how a hepatitis C diagnosis in 1990 changed her life. She said doctors only gave her three years to live after she contracted the virus during her work as a nurse, ""before the Judds took off."" She was declared free of the illness in 1995.

Even after her recovery, Naomi continued to struggle with mental illness, writing: ""Had plenty of reasons to jump out of bed every morning. Never did I expect that only months after the Encore tour [in 2010] ended, I would feel I had every reason to jump off a bridge to end my tortured existence."" She also wrote that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from ""traumatic events"" in her life.

On Sunday, the Judds were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, just one day after Naomi died unexpectedly. The induction ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee , was filled with tears, music and laughter as country music's biggest stars mourned the loss of Naomi while also honoring the four inductees.

11,New York Times reporter says 'a lot of Democrats' don't believe Biden will run in 2024,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin seemed highly skeptical President Biden will run for reelection in 2024 despite multiple assurances that he will seek a second term.

On Monday, Martin and Times colleague Alexander Burns appeared on ""The View"" to promote their politically-buzzed book ""This Will Not Pass,"" which has made major headlines about the turbulent final weeks of the Trump presidency and the behind-the-scenes drama among Democrats, including tensions between Team Biden and Team Kamala Harris.

POLITIFACT RUNS COVER FOR BIDEN, DECLARES VIRAL CLIP OF HIM ‘SHAKING HANDS’ WITH AIR IS ‘FALSE’

Martin expressed his amazement at how ""it's not clear"" whether the incumbent president will pursue another four-year term.

""We have not had a first-term president in recent years where it was uncertain that they're going to be a candidate and the next reelection and that is the case with Biden. And so that makes this all the more interesting,"" Martin said.

""The View"" guest co-host Ana Navarro, who staunchly supported Biden in the 2020 presidential election, defended his honor by pointing to jokes he made at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner alluding to his 2024 bid, but Martin wasn't convinced.

""He wants to run. He's told people that we talked to for our book that he plans to run in 24 for reelection unless there's a health issue intervening,"" Martin told Navarro. ""A lot of Democrats don't believe that. They're convinced he's not gonna run.

""Based on what?"" Navarro pushed back.

""Based on the fact that he'll be 82 years old in 2024 and that they're just skeptical that he's gonna serve a full second term or if he wants her a full second term, which raises the question of, ‘Well, if not Biden, who?’ And that's what shapes the Kamala Harris news here.""

WHEN DEMS HAVE ELECTION YEAR STRUGGLES, MEDIA BLAMES MESSAGING WOES

""She'd only been in the Senate for a few years and doesn't have the relationships in Washington that Biden has, and so she was not able to kind of fill the role that Biden did when he was VP on Capitol Hill. And she didn't have a foreign policy experience either. So I think her challenge has been sort of finding her niche, and it's created tensions with the West Wing,"" Martin continued. ""We have a scene in the book in which she's feeling disrespected because she sees staffers in the West Wing when she walks into the room who are not standing for her, and they always stand for President Biden when he walks into the room. And she had her chief of staff telephone somebody in the West Wing and say, 'She's noticed this. Please tell the staff when the VP walks into the room they are to stand.'""

Burns then chimed in, pointing out the ""unmistakable context of identity"" regarding the tensions between Biden and Harris.

""The Biden inner circle is overwhelmingly White, it is largely male, and they have largely been with Biden for a very, very long time,"" Burns said. ""And so anybody who has been new to the Biden operation, they will tell you right away it is a tough nut to crack. It is tough to get close to this president and that's been the case for the vice president too.""

There has been much speculation about Democrats potentially competing in a primary against Biden, who is suffering from historically bad polling.

12,Biden’s first stop in Iowa since winning White House sparks 2024 speculation,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Biden heads to Iowa on Tuesday to push his economic agenda and highlight the moves he’s making to lower costs for working families.

The trip to the Hawkeye State will be the president’s first since winning the White House in the 2020 election. And his visit’s likely to shine a spotlight on whether Iowa will continue to kick off the presidential nominating calendar and whether Biden will seek a second term in 2024.

BIDEN SAYS HE'S RUNNING AGAIN, BUT DEMOCRATS KEEP COMING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE

Biden’s expected to showcase the investments his administration’s making in Iowa through the massive bipartisan infrastructure measure he signed into law last autumn.

The White House says that at the event in Menlo, which is 45 miles west of Des Moines, the president will ""discuss his Administration’s actions to lower costs for working families, reduce the impact of Putin’s Price Hike, and Build a Better America with Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments in rural communities.""

The stop in Menlo also kicks off the administration's rural infrastructure tour. And while in Iowa, the president's also expected to announce an emergency waiver that would lift a ban on the summertime sale of E15, a gasoline that includes 15% ethanol, to help ease soaring gas prices.

While this is an official trip to push policy, Democratic strategists say that campaign politics both in the 2022 midterms and the 2024 White House race are considerations in the president’s itinerary.

""There's no decision that the White House makes about where to send the president that doesn't have some sort of political consideration. They're not choosing these places by accident, ever,"" a Democratic strategist with ties to Biden world told Fox News.

HALF OF AMERICANS DOUBT BIDEN WILL RUN FOR REELECTION IN 2024: POLL

But the strategist pointed to next year’s midterms, rather than the 2024 White House race, as the main political motivator for heading to Iowa.

Menlo is located in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, which is represented by two-term Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne, who won her 2018 election and 2020 reelection by razor-thin margins. House Republicans, who need a net gain of just five seats in the 435 member chamber to win back the majority, are targeting Axne as she runs for reelection this year.

Thanks to Iowa’s longstanding lead off position in the presidential nominating calendar, the president’s stop in Des Moines will also likely generate more speculation about whether the 79-year-old Biden will run for reelection in 2024.

The then-former vice president made history in November 2020 when he became the oldest person ever elected president. If he campaigns for re-election in 2024 and wins, Biden would be 82 at his second inaugural and 86 at the end of his second term.

Asked over a year ago at the first formal news conference of his presidency about his 2024 plans, Biden said, ""My answer is yes. I plan on running for re-election. That’s my expectation.""

And he said in an interview with ABC News in December that ""If I'm in the health I'm in now, if I'm in good health, then in fact, I would run again.""

Former President Donald Trump, at his 2017 inauguration, made history at age 70 as the oldest American sworn in as president. That record was shattered four years later by Biden.

CHECK OUT OUR LATEST FOX NEWS WEEKLY COLUMN ON THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Fifty-two percent of those questioned in a Wall Street Journal survey conducted early last month said they didn’t think the president will launch a re-election campaign, with 29% saying they do expect Biden to seek re-election and 19% unsure.

In November, the president made New Hampshire first stop to sell the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure measure that he had signed into law two days earlier. Besides being a key midterm election battleground state, New Hampshire for a century has held the first primary in the presidential nominating calendar.

The president’s trip to Iowa comes as Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) seriously considers a revamping of its 2024 presidential nominating calendar that could knock Iowa from the leadoff position it’s held for half a century. It’s likely Biden will face questions regarding the Democrats’ caucus and primary schedule.

WILL THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE UPEND THE 2024 PRIMARY CALENDAR?

Iowa’s leadoff status faced scrutiny last month at the DNC’s winter meetings, as many members who spoke were clearly open to reordering the presidential nominating calendar to better reflect the party’s growing diversity and values.

Iowa’s currently followed in the schedule by New Hampshire – and then Nevada and South Carolina.

The knock for years against Iowa and New Hampshire among many Democrats has been that the states are too White, lack any major urban areas, and aren’t representative of a Democratic Party that’s become increasingly diverse over the past several decades. Nevada and South Carolina are much more diverse than either Iowa or New Hampshire.

Complicating matters, Nevada Democrats last year passed a bill into law that would transform the state’s presidential caucus into a primary and aim to move the contest to the leadoff position in the race for the White House, ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire. And compounding Iowa's issues was the botched reporting of the 2020 caucuses, which became a national and international story, and an embarrassment for Iowa Democrats as well as the DNC.

13,"White House eyes income cap on student loan forgiveness, has not studied how it may impact inflation","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Biden is considering whether to use income to determine eligibility as part of any student loan forgiveness program, the White House said Monday.

The president last week floated the possibility of eliminating $10,000 in debt per student borrower, likely through executive action.

During Monday’s White House press briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked whether an income cap for any potential student relief program was under consideration.

ERASING STUDENT LOAN DEBT COULD DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT WEALTHY AMERICANS

""There is,"" Psaki said.

It is unclear, at this point, what the maximum income would be for student loan forgiveness, should an income cap be included in any possible plans. Officials have reportedly floated the possibility of limiting the relief to people who earned less than $125,000 or $150,000 as individual filers the previous year. That would amount to a threshold of roughly $250,000 to $300,000 for couples who file their taxes jointly.

Psaki noted that income caps would be to ensure that student loan relief is ""targeted at people who need help the most.""

Psaki was also pressed on whether the White House has analyzed how potential student loan forgiveness could impact inflation.

""I know there’s been outside analysis of that, but I don’t have any internal analysis at this point to preview for you,"" she said.

Last week, the president said he is ""considering dealing with some debt reduction.""

""I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction, but I'm in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness,"" Biden said.

BIDEN EXTENDS STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PAUSE UNTIL AUG. 31, SAYING US 'STILL RECOVERING' FROM COVID-19

Biden supported erasing $10,000 in student debt for most borrowers during his presidential campaign, but has raised questions about his legal authority to do so via executive order. Last year, the president requested a memo from the Education Department to determine whether he had the power to unilaterally cancel student loan debt.

The Kardashian-Jenner family members have won in the defamation lawsuit brought against them by Blac Chyna.

Following the news on Monday, Michael Rhodes and Michelle Doolin, trial counsel for the famous family issued a statement.

""On behalf of Kris, Kim, Khloe, and Kylie, I want to express our appreciation to the jury,"" the statement obtained by Fox News Digital read.

It continued: ""We are also grateful for the steady hand of Judge Alarcon in making sure that this was a fair trial. The jury sent a clear message to Ms. White and her lawyer -- I hope they are listening. Justice has prevailed.""

LOS ANGELES JUDGE THROWS OUT DEFAMATION PORTION OF BLAC CHYNA'S LAWSUIT AGAINST KIM KARDASHIAN

The Los Angeles jury found that none of the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family defamed Chyna, nor did any interfere with her contract by convincing the E! network to cancel her reality show ""Rob & Chyna.""

""Rob & Chyna"" starred Chyna and her then-fiancé Rob Kardashian. It aired for one season in 2016.

The four Kardashian defendants attended nearly the entire trial, and they all also testified, but when the verdict was read all were in New York at the Met Gala, where this year’s theme was ""Gilded Glamour.""

Chyna was in court for the verdict. She had no visible reaction.

After about 10 hours of deliberations, the jurors found on the long jury form that the Kardashians often acted in bad faith on the issues brought up in the case, but that it had no substantial effect on Chyna's contract or the fate of the show.

Chyna, who shares a 5-year-old daughter with Rob Kardashian, was awarded no damages.

Executives from the E! network, which aired the show, testified that ""Rob & Chyna"" ended because the relationship ended, not because of the defendants' actions.

Jurors were considering the defamation case against Kris Jenner, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, after a judge threw out the part of the lawsuit against Kim Kardashian in the middle of deliberations.

The trial focused largely on allegations that Chyna violently attacked her then-fiancé and reality TV co-star Rob Kardashian on a night and morning in December 2016.

He testified that she twice held a gun to his head, wrapped a phone-charging cord around his neck and beat him with a metal rod. She testified that she had put the cord around his neck and held the gun playfully as the two celebrated the renewal of their reality show, and when the celebration turned into a dispute, she was never violent against him.

Democratic governors and attorneys general responded to the alleged draft of a forthcoming Supreme Court opinion striking down Roe v. Wade with horror and a renewed dedication to abortion rights.

The draft, which the Court refused to confirm or deny and which appears to date back to February, would reverse Roe v. Wade (1973) and allow the states to make their own laws on the hot-button issue of abortion. Since this is a draft, reported by Politico, and not an official signed opinion, Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land. Drafts circulate and change.

""I am horrified by the apparent draft Supreme Court opinion leaked this evening that would overturn the right to abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade,"" Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. ""For the sake of women across the country, this should not be the Supreme Court's final opinion when it comes to abortion rights.""

SUPREME COURT SET TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, LEAKED DRAFT OPINION SHOWS: REPORT

Hochul said she refuses ""to go backwards"" on the issue. ""I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights generations have fought for and won, rights that she should be guaranteed,"" she said.

""For anyone who needs access to care, our state will welcome you with open arms,"" the governor added. ""New York will always be a place where abortion rights are protected and where abortion is safe and accessible. Just as the Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp tall in our harbor, New York will never stop fighting for what's right — unafraid and undeterred.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., called the draft an ""appalling attack on the rights of women.""

""This draft opinion is an appalling attack on the rights of women across this country and if it stands, it will destroy lives and put countless women in danger,"" he said in a statement Monday. ""It will be the end of fundamental constitutional rights that American women have had for nearly 50 years.""

Newsom claimed that the draft opinion shows that the Court ""does not value the rights of women.""

""We have a Supreme Court that does not value the rights of women, and a political minority that will stop at nothing to take those rights away,"" he said. ""This won’t stop with choice and the right to privacy. They are undermining progress, and erasing the civil protections and rights so many have fought for over the last half century.""

""We have to wake up. We have to fight like hell. We will not be silenced,"" he concluded.

MARYLAND DEMS OVERRIDE GOVERNOR'S VETO TO FUND ABORTION TRAINING, ALLOW NON-DOCTORS TO PERFORM ABORTIONS

Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., described Monday as a ""truly dark day in America.""

""A truly dark day in America with the news reports that the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" he wrote on Twitter. (It remains unclear whether the Court has indeed voted to overturn Roe, and the situation may change even if it has.) ""This year, I signed the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act – codifying a woman's right to choose into state law. New Jersey will not go backwards on reproductive rights.""

""I want to assure every New Jerseyan that today’s news about the Supreme Court does not change access to abortion in our state,"" he added.​ ""Access to reproductive health care remains available to anyone who needs it in New Jersey.""

Attorney General Phil Weiser, D-Colo., pledged to defend ""reproductive rights"" if the Court will not.

""Now would be a good time to make clear that Colorado will protect reproductive rights regardless of whether #SCOTUS does,"" he tweeted. ""And we will be protect the right to travel here for abortion services as well.""

States with Democratic legislatures have passed laws codifying abortion in case Roe gets overturned. Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo., signed a law creating a ""fundamental right"" to abortion and denying any right for the unborn. In 2019, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., signed a law codifying abortion rights and explicitly removing protections from unborn infants.

While many polls suggest Americans support Roe, in-depth polling reveals a more complicated picture. When asked about their opinion on abortion during specific periods of pregnancy and other situations, 71% of Americans say they support restricting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy (22%), or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest (28%), to save the life of the mother (9%) or not at all (12%). Only 17% of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12% said it should be restricted to the first six months.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a scorched-earth approach to NBC on Monday after a left-wing Peacock host accused him of handing Twitter ""to the far-right.""

""NBC basically saying Republicans are Nazis …"" Musk wrote in a Monday tweet, responding to a video clip posted by another user showing Mehdi Hasan railing against Musk, calling him a ""not-so-bright billionaire,"" and complaining about his purchase of the social media giant.

""Same org that covered up Hunter Biden laptop story, had Harvey Weinstein story early & killed it & built Matt Lauer his rape office. Lovely people,"" Musk added in another tweet, listing some of the network's most notorious scandals in recent years.

MSNBC HOST SLAMS ‘PETULANT, NOT-SO-BRIGHT’ ELON MUSK, SAYS HE'S ‘HANDING’ TWITTER TO THE FAR RIGHT

Among the scandals mentioned by Musk were the Hunter Biden laptop story, which NBC frequently ignored despite revelations the laptop was not ""Russian disinformation"" as some news outlets claimed, as well as former reporter Ronan Farrow's allegation that NB suppressed his story on the raft of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

Musk also mentioned the scandal surrounding former NBC ""Today Show"" anchor Matt Lauer, who was fired from the network in 2017 after being accused of inappropriate sexual behavior.

He appeared to reference reports, subsequently denied by Lauer, that there was a secret button under his desk at NBC allowing him to lock the door of his office to trap women without getting up from his chair.

Musk has garnered a swath of negative attention from the liberal media since he announced his intentions to purchase Twitter last month.

His $44 billion offer was unanimously accepted by Twitter's board on April 23. Since then, Musk has repeatedly needled left-leaning media figures online, while also saying he's no fan of the ""far right"" either.

""For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,"" he wrote last week.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/elon-musk-scorched-earth-nbc-peacock-host-insults-notes-networks-worst-scandals
17,"Missing Alabama prison official had sold home, was expected to retire before murder suspect escaped","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

An escaped Alabama murder suspect is on the run, possibly armed and dangerous, as a top official at the jail who colleagues expected to retire has been linked to the jailbreak, according to the local sheriff.

Casey Cole White, 38 and Vicky White, 56, were last seen Friday morning on surveillance video ditching a marked vehicle at a parking lot on Florence, Alabama, about 70 miles west of Huntsville, according to authorities.

The two are not related, according to investigators.

ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR MISSING ALABAMA CORRECTIONS OFFICER IN MURDER SUSPECT'S ESCAPE

Vicky White is the assistant director of corrections at the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence. She sold her home about a month ago, according to Lauderdale Sheriff Rick Singleton, and had talked about relocating to the beach for months.

""Everybody thought she was gonna retire,"" he said during a Monday news briefing. ""Nobody saw this coming.""

Authorities announced a warrant for Vicky White Monday, even as the sheriff said her alleged assistance may have been coerced.

""To do it willingly would be so out of character for the Vicky White we all know,"" he said.

They took off in a law enforcement vehicle and the sheriff’s office later recovered abandoned in a parking lot.

She allegedly told colleagues she was going to take the prisoner to the county courthouse for an evaluation and planned to stop at a doctor’s office afterward, saying she didn’t feel well. There was no scheduled evaluation, according to the sheriff.

Authorities thought Vicky White came to work that day to serve her last day before retiring, Singleton said. But she hadn’t yet cleared all of the bureaucratic hurdles.

""I think from the sale of the house, she possibly had access to some cash,"" he said. ""The retirement papers were never sent into the state retirement system. She had to have a conference with the personnel director before that could happen.""

Casey White was serving an unrelated, 75-year prison sentence when he confessed to killing 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway in 2015. He subsequently pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Singleton issued a warning Monday that the escaped prisoner should be considered ""extremely dangerous"" and that any law enforcement officers who come across him should not take ""any chances.""

ALABAMA INMATE, OFFICER MISSING AFTER EXPECTED COURT APPEARANCE

The jailbreak has drawn comparisons to the 2015 escape from the Clinton Correction Facility in Dannemora, New York, during which a prison tailor there flirted with two convicted killers before allegedly helping them break out.

Seth Ferranti, an ex-con turned writer and filmmaker who was an extra on Showtime’s ""Escape at Dannemora"" series, told Fox News Digital that Casey White may have seduced the prison official and said the cases seemed ""very similar"" at first glance.

""Cons are notorious for doing long plays and being super manipulative, but maybe it’s true love,"" he said.

According to the sheriff, Casey White had previously plotted an escape attempt from the county jail in late 2020.

His alleged plan was to take a hostage and break out of the facility on the day of his arraignment, before he was scheduled to transfer back to state prison. Officers caught him in possession of a ""shank,"" or prison knife, and safely transferred him back to prison.

He again returned to the county jail in February of this year.

Casey White faces a possible death penalty if convicted in Ridgeway’s death.

""He has nothing to lose with his violent past,"" Singleton said. ""He is extremely dangerous.""

Both Whites may be armed, according to authorities.

The Arizona Cardinals will reportedly be without DeAndre Hopkins for six games as he was suspended for violating the NFL’s performance-enhancing drug policy.

It’s unclear what the specific drug the wide receiver tested positive for was. ESPN first reported the suspension.

""DeAndre Hopkins of the Arizona Cardinals has been suspended without pay for the first six games of the 2022 regular season for violating the NFL policy on performance-enhancing substances,"" an NFL spokesperson said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

""Hopkins is eligible to participate in all preseason practices and games. He will be allowed to return to the Cardinals’ active roster following the team’s sixth regular-season game.""

Hopkins is a five-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro wide receiver. He is about to enter his third season with the Cardinals after Arizona acquired him in a blockbuster 2020 trade with the Houston Texans.

Since then, he’s been one of the top targets for Kyler Murray. He played all 16 games in his first season with Arizona and was selected to a Pro Bowl. He had 115 catches for 1,407 yards and six touchdowns. He only managed to play in 10 games in 2021 due to injuries. He had 42 catches for 572 yards and eight touchdowns.

His targets were sure to go up after Christian Kirk left and signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars. But the reported suspension now throws everything into disarray.

Arizona did acquire wide receiver Marquise Brown from the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday during the NFL Draft. Baltimore traded Brown and a third-round pick to the Cardinals for their No. 23 pick. Baltimore used the 23rd pick to select center Taylor Linderbaum.

The New York Times quickly deleted a scathing tweet Sunday on the breaking news that Kathy Boudin, a member of the radical militant group Weather Underground, had died, replacing it with softer language.

""Kathy Boudin, who as a member of the Weather Underground took part in the murderous 1981 holdup of a Brink’s armored truck, died on Sunday. She was 78,"" the initial tweet said.

However, within two minutes, the tweet was deleted and replaced with kinder words for the convict who spent decades in prison following a 1981 armored truck heist that left two police officers and a security guard dead.

""Kathy Boudin, a member of the Weather Underground imprisoned for her role in a fatal robbery but who later helped former inmates, died at 78,"" the new tweet reads.

The Times’ change in language was swiftly criticized by Twitter users.

""Why did you delete your tweet softening Kathy Boudin’s role in a deadly terrorist attack? Pretending to be a scared woman, she pleaded with the officers to lower their weapons so that her comrades could burst out the back of the truck to shoot them dead,"" independent journalist Andy Ngo wrote.

A Florida mother is filing suit and issuing a stark warning to parents nationwide after her transgender child transitioned at school without her consent.

MASSACHUSETTS PARENTS SUE SCHOOL, SAY OFFICIALS ENCOURAGED CHILDREN TO USE NEW NAMES, PRONOUNS WITHOUT CONSENT

Florida mom and mental health professional January Littlejohn and her attorney Vernadette Broyles discussed the lawsuit and why she is ""outraged"" over the incident.

""This is happening all over the nation,"" Littlejohn warned on ""Fox & Friends First"" on Monday. ""This same protocol is in place in many, many schools across districts everywhere, and even the guides being used to dictate these transgender support plans that cut parents out even have the same language.""

""So this is a very systematic way that parents are being excluded from important decisions occurring with their children, and further, social transition is a medical intervention that schools are grossly unqualified to be taking these steps without parental involvement,"" she continued.

REPUBLICANS PUSH CARDONA ON REPORTS OF 12-YEAR-OLD'S SUICIDE ATTEMPT FOLLOWING SECRET SCHOOL GENDER TALKS

According to Littlejohn, her daughter, who was 13 years old at the time, expressed confusion over gender during the pandemic after a group of friends transitioned to the opposite sex.

She eventually found out the school was working on a ""transgender support plan"" with her child, but the school initially declined to allow her involvement given she was ""protected by a nondiscrimination law.""

""Eventually we did see the transgender support plan, which was a six-page document that they completed with my daughter, that was 13 at the time behind closed doors, where they asked her questions that would have absolutely impacted her safety, such as which restroom she preferred to use and which sex she preferred to room with on overnight field trips,"" Littlejohn said.

25,"MSNBC, The View, late-night hosts repeatedly hurl personal attacks at DeSantis","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A Thursday opinion piece from MSNBC saw columnist Michael A. Cohen sound the alarm on the ""vindictiveness, cruelty and demagoguery"" of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, R., a politician labeled by the writer as ""the most dangerous figure in American politics,"" even more so than former President Donald Trump.

Trump has largely stepped out of the political limelight since losing the 2020 presidential election, occasionally hinting at a possible 2024 run for the Oval Office, endorsing Republican candidates and hosting political rallies. While the liberal media still often chomps at the bit for any taste of Trump news, DeSantis’ prominence in the culture wars, embrace of Trump and lofty numbers with GOP voters have made him a prime target.

More recently, left-leaning pundits and their guests have ratcheted up the heat on DeSantis over a string of headline-generating moves, including a public battle against Disney and signed legislation aimed at reforming Florida's public education system, such as the Florida Parental Rights Law.

DESANTIS ACCUSES DISNEY OF COZYING UP TO CCP, MAKING 'A FORTUNE' WITHOUT MENTIONING ATROCITIES

According to ""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin, ""bigotry is on the ballot when it comes to Ron DeSantis.""

The women of ""The View"" have repeatedly hurled criticism at the Sunshine State governor on a number of issues.

During an April 25 segment focused on a separate bill signed into law by DeSantis stripping Disney of its self-governing status in response to its opposition, the liberal co-hosts railed against the actions being taken, calling them ""anti-Black,"" ""anti-gay,"" ""anti-LGBTQ+,"" ""shameful,"" ""anti-American,"" and ""a message of hate.""

""It’s anti-woke; and woke, what that really means when you look it up in the dictionary, it’s an awareness of social justice. It’s an awareness of marginalized communities. It’s an awareness and, for some reason, Ron DeSantis and his Republican base, they don’t want people to know that there are social injustices going on,"" Hostin added.

This is far from the first time The View has taken shots at DeSantis. In September, while discussing masking in schools, Joy Behar claimed that DeSantis was putting his ""political ambitions"" ahead of the welfare and safety children.

""He should be criminally liable for that,"" she added. ""You are actually committing negligent homicide when people die on your watch.""

DESANTIS SLAMS WHCA AND CALLS TREVOR NOAH'S CLAIM ABOUT HIM DURING DINNER A 'LIE'

Late-night show hosts have also used DeSantis as the center of numerous jokes.

Comedian Trevor Noah made several jokes at DeSantis’s expense during his performance at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner Saturday night, saying at one point that ""Ron DeSantis is here,"" and looking into the audience as if he was directing his attention at the governor himself. DeSantis wasn't in attendance and said he had no interest in the event.

""I did not watch it, I don’t care what they do, but for them to advertise me when that invitation was rejected by my office, that is a lie,"" DeSantis said in a Monday news conference.

Noah has previously mocked DeSantis on a number of separate occasions. On April 20, Noah aired a satirical video where Mickey Mouse ridiculed the governor for threatening Disney’s special self-governance status.

""Ron DeSantis claims to be a conservative, but right now he’s acting like a liberal b---,"" Mickey said in the Comedy Central bit.

Other late-night hosts have also engaged in profanity-laced rants and jokes against the governor. In August 2020, CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert reacted to a video of DeSantis telling Biden he didn’t want to hear a ""blip"" about COVID from the president.

""Well governor, looks like it’s your turn to eat blip,"" Colbert said, noting that Florida had asked the Biden administration for ventilators and other protective equipment. In a separate instance, Colbert said that DeSantis could use Jared Kushner’s butt as a ventilator, one of several times he's used profane or more juvenile humor to attack the right. Another time, he called Trump Vladimir Putin's ""c--k holster.""

""Under the new law a teacher can’t explain that their governor is a d---head,"" Jimmy Kimmel said on a March 29 installment of ABC’s late night show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" ""That kind of language is not allowed anymore, so it’s up to parents to explain that their governor is a d---head.""

GOP GOVERNOR RIPS DESANTIS' 'PUNITIVE APPROACH' TOWARD DISNEY AFTER PARENTAL RIGHTS DUST-UP

MSNBC has also engaged in countless segments criticizing DeSantis.

Host Joy Reid embarked on another rant against DeSantis last week, claiming he now has his ""own private police force"" meant to ""intimidate"" Black Floridians ""out of being able to vote.""

""So he's taken away Black representation. He’s taken away the ability of African-Americans to vote, and he passed this police force that you know will be sicced on Black Floridians to intimidate them out of even being able to vote,"" Reid later added.

Reid’s colleague Nicolle Wallace has also been less than kind in her conversations about the governor. The ""Deadline: White House"" host emphatically condemned the recent education bills passed by DeSantis and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin as ""dehumanization"" tactics on April 19.

Wallace went one step further to accuse the governor and others like him as using tactics akin to soldiers who ""rape children.""

""I worry in covering Glenn Youngkin and his politics of ‘parental choice,’ all the focus was on how well it worked. And even in our conversations about DeSantis it’s about how well they’re serving him,"" Wallace said. ""The truth is dehumanization as a tactic for politics is from war. Dehumanization is a tactic, speaking right now where Russians get the soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them. Dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war.

29,Bank of America analysts slash S&P 500 projection as 'specter of recession' looms,"The S&P 500 just suffered its worst April performance since 1970, plunging into its second correction of the year — now, many experts are lowering their projection for the index this year.

Bank of America analysts led by Savita Subramanian trimmed their year-end outlook for the S&P 500 by 100 points to 4,500, which would mark more than a 6% drop from the beginning of 2022. In April, the benchmark S&P index dropped about 8.8%. It is down about 13.48% so far this year, indicating that the market has priced in about a one-third chance of a recession, according to the BofA analysts.

FED RAISES INTEREST RATES FOR FIRST TIME IN 3 YEARS, PROJECTS 6 MORE HIKES AS INFLATION SURGES

""The specter of a recession looms,"" Subramanian wrote. ""And we thus shift defensive, couple-raising consumer staples from underweight to overweight.""

Stocks in this Article I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES $33061.5 +84.29 (+0.26%) SP500 S&P 500 $4155.38 +23.45 (+0.57%) I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX $12536.017122 +201.38 (+1.63%)

There are several threats to the outlook, including worsening economic growth in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve that's looking to aggressively tighten monetary policy in order to tame inflation.

""This is all against a backdrop of cyclically peaked S&P 500 EPS facing secular margin pressure (de-globalization), still lofty valuations and a Fed taper still in play,"" Subramanian said.

The note comes amid growing fears on Wall Street over an economic recession triggered by the Fed as it looks to combat inflation, which is at the highest level since December 1981. Policymakers raised rates by a quarter-percentage point in March, and have since signaled that sharper, half-point increases are likely in the coming months, beginning in May.

""It is appropriate to be moving a little more quickly,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last month during a panel discussion at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. ""I also think there’s something in the idea of front end-loading whatever accommodation one thinks is appropriate. So that points in the direction of 50-basis points being on the table.""

Traders are now pricing in a 100% chance of at least a half-point rate jump when policymakers meet this week. It would mark the first time since 2000 that the U.S. central bank raised the federal funds rate by 50 basis points.

Some economists believe the Fed waited too long to confront the burst in inflation, while others have expressed concerns that moving too quickly to stabilize prices risks triggering an economic recession. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.

Powell has pushed back against concern that further tightening by the central bank will trigger a recession and has maintained optimism that the Fed can strike a delicate balance between taming inflation without crushing the economy.

Still, he acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead and said it is ""absolutely essential"" for central bankers to restore price stability.

""Our goal is to use our tools to get demand and supply back in sync, so inflation moves back into place, without a slowdown that amounts to a recession,"" Powell said. ""I don't think you'll hear anyone at the Fed say that's straightforward and easy. It's going to be challenging.""",https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bank-of-america-analysts-market-projections-specter-of-recession

Fans were appalled by the reference and expressed outrage on social media.

""I cannot believe I got this email today,"" one person wrote on Twitter. ""Is this some kind of sick joke? How insensitive and absolutely tone-deaf. Apparently nobody in marketing at Ulta remembers how Kate Spade died. Disgusting.""

Another chimed in, ""Just got this email … this is wrong of Ulta Beauty … Kate Spade committed suicide by hanging herself.""

31,Australian man who insulted Chinese President Xi Jinping says police told him he will be charged,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

An Australian man who held up a sign displaying an insult against Chinese President Xi Jinping at a busy Asian market in Sydney said he's been told by authorities he could be charged over the incident even though he was reportedly attacked by Chinese nationalists.

Drew Pavlou was filmed holding the sign that read ""F*** Xi Jinping"" in Chinese on Saturday at the Eastwood Plaza. The signage quickly triggered an angry reaction from some shoppers, some of whom vented their frustration, according to footage of the incident on Pavlou's Twitter account.

.The video shows angry people confronting him.

""America has genocide,"" according to subtitles in a video of the incident.

WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

Another man snatches the sign and throws it to the ground. One said he was ""disrespecting Chinese here."" During the encounter, Pavlou tells the crowd he is non-violent.

He later tweeted that the New South Wales Police Force contacted him to inform him that detectives were investigating him and that he would likely be charged.

""NSW Police want to charge me for holding a sign insulting Xi Jinping while campaigning in Sydney,"" Lavlou wrote. ""They won’t even tell me what I’m being charged with. I’m sick of attacks on free speech, Australia desperately needs a Bill of Rights to protect free expression.""

He also tweeted about the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghur Muslims who have been rounded up and detained in camps.

A spokesperson for the police force declined to confirm that Pavlou was being investigated but said they were investigating an alleged assault that occurred during a political protest at the Eastwood Plaza.

""Following inquiries, investigators attended an Eastwood home and spoke with a 48-year-old man about 4.30pm today,"" a police statement said. ""He was issued a court attendance notice for Common Assault and is due to appear at Hornsby Local Court on Wednesday.""

In a tweet, Pavlou called threats of being charged an ""intimidation tactic.""

A Pennsylvania woman allegedly shot her two sons in the head at their home on Monday morning before attempting to shoot her neighbor and fleeing the scene, Bucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub said.

Trinh Nguyen, 38, was arrested hours later in a church parking lot and had apparently tried to commit suicide.

Authorities were originally called to Nguyen's home in Upper Makefield Township, Pennsylvania, around 7:00 a.m. on reports of an armed subject.

A 22-year-old neighbor told officers that Nguyen approached and asked him to give a box of photos to her ex-husband, then attempted to fire a black revolver at his face twice, but the gun did not fire.

The neighbor was able to disarm Nguyen, who then jumped in a white Toyota Sienna minivan and fled the area.

One of the officers then entered the home with a neighbor and found her two sons, ages 13 and 9, in their beds with gunshot wounds to their heads.

The two boys are not expected to survive.

""Both children will give the gift of life to others as their organs will be transplanted,"" Weintraub said at a press conference. ""It's a terrible tragedy, but perhaps some good can come out of this yet.""

Nguyen is facing three counts of attempted homicide and one count of possession of an instrument of crime. Once her sons are pronounced deceased, two of those counts will be upgraded to homicide.

She was found in the parking lot of United Methodist Church in Washington’s Crossing around 11:30 a.m., about three miles from her home.

Mike Rowe hit back at President Biden's consideration to cancel student debt up to $10,000 on ""The Five"" Monday, saying ""it's not going to do anything"" to push universities to lower tuition rates.

MIKE ROWE: I'm happy to forgive the loan. Yes. You still have to pay it back. No, this makes me crazy. My foundation focuses on work ethic scholarships, and we award those scholarships to people who affirmatively don't want to purchase a four-year degree. They want to be trained plumbers, steamfitters, pipefitters, electricians, so forth. We've assisted 1,400 people. We've given away about $7 million in work ethic scholarships. And when I hear this story and when I see it framed out, what I hear is the government asking those people to pay specifically for the degrees that have been purchased at an incredible multiple with impunity. I mean, it's breathtaking to me. These people, many of them have work trucks and they have $40-$50,000 worth of tools that they borrowed to get. And nobody anywhere ever talks about forgiving that, including me. Because personally, look, you bought it; fgure it out. And so it gets real personal, real fast. And I always come back to the same question, which is: Is forgiving the loans going to do anything to inspire, motivate or otherwise nudge the universities to drop the cost of tuition?

Former President George W. Bush will appear at a fundraiser for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who has been targeted by former President Donald Trump following a breakdown of their relationship after his 2020 election loss.

The fundraiser will be held at the Texas home of real estate developer Harlan Crow, Politico reported. Bush is listed as a ""special guest,"" the report said.

Tickets for a V.I.P. reception are listed at $15,200, while the general reception is priced at $5,000.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN GEORGIA'S GOP CLASH FOR GOVERNOR

Kemp is a first-term conservative governor who’s facing a primary challenge from former GOP Sen. David Perdue, who is backed by Trump. Trump has called for Kemp to be ousted after the governor refused to help overturn his state's election results after claiming the contest was rigged.

Trump said Kemp had not pushed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hard enough to reverse then-President-elect Joe Biden's victory, The Washington Post reported.

Bush's appearance represents years of tension between the Trump and Bush families, according to Politico. Trump often insulted Bush before running for president and threw jabs during his 2016 bid at Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida.

Bush has largely refrained from criticizing Trump.

Perdue has struggled to tap the same network of big donors that sustained his two Senate runs, despite his endorsement by former President Donald Trump. After having less than $1 million in cash on hand at the end of January, Perdue hinted he would crack his own $50 million fortune to try to keep up with Kemp's spending.

Trump hosted a fundraiser for Perdue at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where contributors had to give $3,000 to attend.

A picture with Trump meant contributing $24,200, the maximum individual contribution for Georgia in this election cycle, including a primary, general election and two possible runoffs. The results of that fundraiser will show up in Perdue's report this week.

The NFL said Monday it found no evidence the Cleveland Browns incentivized former head coach Hue Jackson to lose games during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

Former U.S. Attorney and SEC Chair Mary Jo White and lawyers from the Debevoise firm determined none of the allegations Jackson made over the last couple of months have been substantiated. The NFL said the lawyers were ""unable"" to speak with Jackson directly.

""The investigation found no evidence to suggest that the Browns' Four-Year Plan or the club's ownership or football personnel sought to lose or incentivized losses and made no decisions deliberately to weaken the team to secure a more favorable draft position,"" the league said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

""The comprehensive review included the full cooperation of the Browns and interviews with Jimmy Haslam and current and former members of the organization. While Coach Jackson initially agreed to meet with the investigators, he ultimately did not do so.

""Although unable to speak directly to Coach Jackson, the Debevoise team had access to his public statements and to his filings and testimony in a prior arbitration proceeding. The club also produced thousands of pages of documents, including emails, texts, internal memos and presentation decks as well as other material relating to club operations and the filings and testimony in the arbitration proceeding between the club and Coach Jackson.""

In February, following Brian Flores’ racial discrimination lawsuit against the NFL and three other teams, Jackson indicated on social media that the Browns paid bonuses for team losses and that he was set up to fail.

STEELERS' CHASE CLAYPOOL UNCONCERNED ABOUT WHO QB1 WILL BE: 'WE’RE GOING TO BE PRETTY GOOD'

Jackson was 3-36-1 overall before being fired during the 2018 season. Cleveland was 1-15 in 2016 and 0-16 in 2017.

Jackson first made the claims on Twitter. He wrote Haslam was ""was happy while we kept losing,"" and while it may not have been $100,000 he was offered to lose, Jackson assured followers, ""Trust me it was a good number.""

Kimberly Diemert, the executive director of the Hue Jackson Foundation, said it had records to help Flores.

""Fighting for what is right for everybody is what matters most,"" Diemert tweeted. ""Both of these men have been fighting the right fight. People who know the facts know the fight. To win the war you must be strategic.""

Jackson, who is now the head coach at Grambling State University, told ESPN in February there was money to be made for hitting certain milestones, like attaining a certain number of draft picks and being the youngest team in the league.

""Teams that win are just not the youngest team, not that the youngest teams can't win, so I didn't understand the process. I didn't understand what the plan was, I asked for clarity because it did not talk about winning and losing until year three and four. So that told you right there that something wasn't correct, but I still couldn't understand it until I had the team that I had,"" he told the outlet during an appearance on ""SportsCenter.""

New York Times opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg revealed some Democrats are so ""desperate"" to reengage their base this election season, they are ""hoping"" Donald Trump will return to Twitter.

The MSNBC contributor was commenting on the problems Democrats are facing heading into the midterm elections.

A new poll predicts a bleak outlook for Democrats, with more Latinos and voters under 45 years old saying they will vote for a Republican this November.

Goldberg noted how ""difficult"" it had been for the Democrat Party to motivate their base, while on ""The Beat with Ari Melber,"" Monday.

WASHINGTON POST, POLITICO AGREE BIDEN WILL MAKE ‘CRUCIAL’ MIDTERMS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP

""And then I think there's a sort of cyclical effect, which is that the more Democrats feel like they're staring down doom and staring down two more years, two years of paralysis and, you know, sort of pointless investigations, the more they want to disengage,"" she said.

The Times columnists said some on the left are desperately hoping Donald Trump will return to Twitter to re-energize their voters.

""So I think it's very difficult under these circumstances to get people motivated and to get people to really engage in the way that they were when Donald Trump was president. So there's a little bit of desperation in hoping that Donald Trump's return to Twitter will spur people to turn out,"" she predicted.

Twitter permanently suspended the president’s Twitter account in 2021 after the January 6 Capitol riot, ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence.""

42,Fed rate hikes may drive up your monthly credit card payments: Here's how to cut costs,"The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate in spring 2020 to stimulate economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, interest rates stayed low on a number of financial products, from mortgages to credit cards.

But the Fed has planned several rate hikes in 2022 to combat high inflation, which is surging well above the central bank's 2% annual target. The first increase was implemented this March, causing 30-year mortgage rates to soar past 5% for the first time in more than a decade.

While the Fed's economic policy had a swift and significant impact on mortgage rates, the rate hikes haven't been as consequential for credit card users — yet. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell previously indicated that consumers should expect faster and larger rate increases throughout the year, which means that credit card rates will only continue to rise.

The latest data from the Fed shows that the average credit card interest rate has already begun to tick up along with the federal funds rate. In the first quarter of 2022, the average credit card rate rose to 14.56%, up slightly from 14.51% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

If you're looking for ways to cut down on interest charges as the Fed raises rates this year, you might consider consolidating variable-rate credit card debt into a fixed-rate personal loan. This will lock in your interest rate for the entirety of the repayment term. You can learn more about debt consolidation on Credible.

PROS AND CONS OF BALANCE TRANSFER CREDIT CARDS

When your credit card company can raise your rate

Your credit card issuer can increase your interest rate on new purchases if you have a variable rate that's tied to a certain index like the U.S. prime rate, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Since the prime rate is impacted by the Fed's benchmark rate, your credit card interest rate will likely rise at about the same pace.

""That means you’ll pay more on your card balances,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a recent blog post.

It's important to note that your bank must give you a notice 45 days in advance before increasing your interest rate. Additionally, your credit card rate may rise to a penalty APR if your minimum payment is more than 60 days late past your due date.

Since credit card interest is compounded daily, the added cost of borrowing can add up quickly when your rate increases. Plus, your monthly minimum credit card payments will rise in turn.

If you're struggling to keep up with your minimum monthly payment, you might consider credit card consolidation with a personal loan. You can visit Credible to compare personal loan rates for free without impacting your credit score.

How to pay off credit card debt with a personal loan

Consolidating credit card debt into a personal loan at a lower interest rate may help you lower your monthly payment and save money over time. Plus, debt consolidation is a simple process that can be done completely online. Here are five steps for paying off credit card balances with a personal loan:

1. Check your credit score.

Personal loan lenders determine an applicant's interest rate based in part on creditworthiness and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Borrowers with an excellent credit score and a low credit utilization will see the best possible offers, while those with fair or bad credit may see higher rates — if they qualify at all.

To get a better idea of your credit history, you can request a free copy of your credit report through all three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) on www.AnnualCreditReport.com.

HOW DO BALANCE TRANSFERS AFFECT YOUR CREDIT SCORE?

2. Estimate your loan amount.

Add up your credit card balances to determine how much you need to borrow. You can consolidate the debt from one or multiple credit cards into a single monthly payment with a personal loan. Then, you can use a personal loan calculator to see your monthly payment.

3. Shop around to compare offers.

Most lenders let you get prequalified to see your estimated interest rate with a soft credit inquiry, which won't impact your credit score. You can compare personal loan rates from multiple lenders at once on Credible's online loan marketplace.

6 BEST PERSONAL LOANS FOR GOOD CREDIT

4. Formally apply for the loan.

Once you've chosen the best loan offer for your financial situation, you'll need to submit a formal application. This requires a hard credit check, which will have a temporary negative impact on your credit history. You'll also need to submit proof of identification and income, such as pay stubs and a driver's license.

5. Wipe your credit card balances to zero.

Upon approval, the lender will deposit your personal loan funds directly into your bank account, sometimes as soon as the next business day. You can use your loan to pay off the entire balance of your credit card debt at a fixed rate, so your monthly payment won't rise with inflation.

You can browse current personal loan rates in the table below, and visit Credible to learn more about credit card consolidation.

When I first heard that the Biden administration was giving free smartphones to illegal aliens who recently crossed the border, I was incensed. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I instantly knew why, and that is because the administration doesn't want to detain them.

The open borders advocates have access to the same data I do that can be found within the 2020 Department of Homeland Security Enforcement Lifecycle Report. They know that if aliens are detained and receive a final order of removal from an immigration judge, the aliens will be removed 98% of the time.

The same report also shows that unless a deportable alien is fully detained, 85% will not be removed from the U.S. Only 6% of family groups leave as ordered and about 3% of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) leave as ordered. And let’s remember, 72% of UACs are of the age 15-17.

29 GOP SENATORS JOIN JOHNSON, BIGGS IN RESOLUTION TO REPEAL BIDEN'S ASYLUM RULE

I have said for years that detention is a vital tool to ensure each alien gets due process and actually sees a judge and a court’s final decision can be carried out – whether it’s some sort of relief or an ordered departure. Many advocates and politicians insist these aliens have a right to claim asylum, and I agree. But if you believe that as a function of the legal system, then you also must stand by the decision of that legal process and respect it. Detention guarantees both.

However, this administration is attacking detention and Congress is limiting the funding for it. Under President Trump’s last full year there were more than 55,000 people in immigration detention and now there is about 25,000.

Next year's budget cuts funding from 34,000 beds to an even lower 25,000 beds. Many of the Democrat politicians want to end detention all together. Instead of detention, they want to focus on ""alternatives to detention.""

The most recent budget requests $527.1 million, an increase of $75 million, to expand those alternatives to detention monitoring programs. What ICE really needs is more technology, and they need to combine detention and all technology for effective enforcement to carry out its important mission.

We have done this in both Republican and Democrat administrations. We have never been able to get away from alternative programs and this administration is hell-bent of doing a lot more of it rather than detain.

This is where the phones come in. Here is what my research of these new phones has revealed. There are an estimated 10-12 million individuals with unresolved immigration cases in the United States. The number of people being monitored is only a small percentage awaiting an immigration hearing – approximately 213,000 individuals of the four million on the non-detained docket.

These devices/phones that are being utilized by ICE are supervision devices which allows for individuals who have been placed into removal proceedings to comply with the terms of their release.

To be clear, ICE does not issue free all-purpose phones to migrants. The devices only allow the individual to make a 911 call or contact the ICE officer assigned to their case as per the terms of their release. The supervision applications are pre-installed.

Officers assign the device to an alien, and power on the unit. Functionality is completely controlled by the Agency. Participants are unable to disable features or install third-party applications. In addition, there is no ability to browse the internet, make unauthorized phone calls, access app stores, manipulate the phone settings and send or receive text messages. The device also has GPS capability. This mobile monitoring app provides a secure platform for communication between the ICE officer and alien.

Now comes a tough choice. When you are dealing with an administration that controls Congress and the White House that is hell-bent on detaining fewer and fewer migrants, what’s the lesser of two evils? Release migrants with no oversight, no monitoring, no GPS capability; or do you try to monitor and track them to the best of your ability? They can certainly toss the device in a lake and disappear but data shows that most do not. Most people abscond after receiving a final order.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Here is why the monitoring is important. If the device maintains a good success rate like it has thus far, more aliens will be in court when they receive a final order of removal.

Orders that are issued ""in absentia"" (alien was not present at the time the judge makes a decision), are often appealed because the alien will claim he never received notice of the hearing and has a right to be heard which delays for years the final outcome. A device that will increase the likelihood that you show up to court to be served the decision usually removes that petty appeals process.

To be clear, I support detention. It’s the most successful way to ensure migrants received due process and ensures swift removal when a court orders it. ""Catch and release"" sends a bad message to the rest of the world to enter our country illegally, and you will be set free. That is why we ended it under the Trump administration.

44,"Guidelines for health are meant to guide, not mandate","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

When the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force came out last week against the routine use of aspirin as a preventive in people over 60, citing the risk of bleeding, it did not change my clinical decision-making one iota, and instead reminded me of a basic truth in medicine, patients must be seen and treated as individuals, guidelines are intended to guide, and are not meant to be converted to mandates or dictums.

Don’t get me wrong, a smart clinician should be mindful of a bleeding risk whenever recommending aspirin, and this risk certainly increases with age, but so does the risk that you are building up sticky plaque that could lead to a sudden heart attack or stroke, and a good doctor can weigh the risk/benefits of any drug including aspirin much better than a guideline can.

This brings to mind another time the USPSTF tried to alter the practice of clinical medicine with a superimposed guideline, when they discouraged the routine use of the Prostate Specific Antigen in man over the age of 70, despite the fact that the PSA had led to the earlier diagnosis of prostate cancer leading to more surgical cures.

DOES A DAILY ASPIRIN HELP PEOPLE OVER 60 AVOID HEART DISEASE AND STROKE? EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS JUST CHANGED

Still, this august group pointed to the knee-jerk biopsies and surgeries that frequently resulted from an elevated PSA, which did not prolong life. Whereas I and many urologists and primary care physicians disagreed, arguing that the PSA was a useful tool, and the information it gave you valuable. It wasn’t a PSA that ordered a biopsy, it was a clinician.

To this day I routinely check the PSA on many men over the age of 45, and I act on the result based on many factors including genetics. No good doctor knee jerks anything.

The guideline problem has gotten worse during the COVID pandemic, when lockdowns, closures, vaccine and mask mandates have followed straight from guidelines.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The public has now lost the sense of guidelines guiding physicians, and is reacting negatively instead to the new normal of guidelines leading directly to mandates. The politicization of guidelines is not good for public health whether it applies to vaccine mandates without a carve out for natural immunity or testing negative the way Israel and the European Union has had, or to costly school closures, or to mask mandates without attention paid to what type of mask, whether they are effective or not, and whether taking them off to eat or drink erodes the essential public health strategy.

This lack of public health consistency was born out by Florida federal court judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle’s ruling against the CDC’s transportation mask mandate on planes, trains, and busses, based on a disagreement over the term ""sanitation"" as well as the fact that the CDC didn’t call for a public referendum prior to instituting the rule. This court action has opened a Pandora's box that will likely end in the Supreme Court and could hamper or restrict CDC’s powers.

Population studies have indicated an apparent effectiveness for proper mask use in areas of high viral spread but because of the heavy hand of mandates, as soon as they are lifted there is scarcely a mask in sight.

This type of on again, off again or red light/green light is hardly consistent with good public health policy. I may choose to continue to fly with an N95 mask, but now I am practically the only one at the airport or on the plane wearing one.

We need to return to an era where guidelines simply guide, and do not mandate, while at the same time, the digital age can be utilized to help inform these guidelines with up to date information. The key to successful public health is flexibility, not dogma.

45,"In football coach prayer case, students' religious liberty is at risk","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Supreme Court may be about to fumble a major case involving a former high school football coach who sought to impose prayer on his players.

The court has taken up the case of former high school football coach Joe Kennedy and his allegations that the Bremerton School District in Washington State violated his free speech and free exercise rights. But the religious liberty that is actually at stake belongs to student athletes who are at the mercy of their coach. Public school coaches cannot be allowed to abuse their position of authority to impose religion on students.

Kennedy’s attorneys have sought to wave a magic wand and distort the facts of the case in order to secure a victory before the court and the court of public opinion. At various times, they have claimed that Kennedy’s post-game prayers on the 50-yard line were ""private,"" ""silent"" and ""personal.""

NBC OP-ED SOUNDS ALARM OVER SUPREME COURT POTENTIALLY SIDING WITH FOOTBALL COACH FIRED FOR ON-FIELD PRAYERS

None of those descriptors is accurate. An appellate judge even called Kennedy’s attorneys’ version of events a ""deceitful narrative.""

For years, Kennedy imposed his religion on football players by reciting team prayers not only on the field at the 50-yard line after games but, tellingly, also in the locker room. He bragged about his 50-yard line prayers on Fox News Radio in October 2015, saying that the ""entire team"" joined him. It was apparent at the time that he wanted to continue to involve students in the prayers.

Now, the former coach wants to spin the case and claim the school system is somehow stifling his right to engage in private prayer. In reality, the school district tried valiantly to accommodate him.

Kennedy refused an accommodation that would allow him to pray in the school building, athletic facility, press box or on the 50-yard line after his duties as coach had ended. He refused to stop making his communal prayer part of a public school sporting event.

SUPREME COURT CAN SAVE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR FOOTBALL COACHES, AND FOR ALL AMERICANS

It is entirely reasonable, and constitutional, for the Bremerton School District to make sure that an employee’s religious activity is not interfering with job duties. Ultimately, the former coach’s prayers became a spectacle and interfered with the rights of conscience of students.

TEACHERS AND COACHES DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTED

At the homecoming game in 2015, Kennedy and an onslaught of pious performance artists rushed the field after the game, knocking over some students. Kennedy invited a state legislator to join his prayer and address the team.

True religious freedom means that students are not pressured or encouraged by school staff to engage in religious activity. Religion is personal and students’ rights of conscience must not be interfered with by a coach who wants to impose religion on other people’s children.

One Bremerton parent reported that his son felt ""compelled to participate"" because he feared that he ""wouldn’t get to play as much.""

Other parents said that their children participated in the prayers because they didn’t want to be separated from the team.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh recognized such concerns during the oral argument this week when he noted that every player ""is trying to get on the good side of the coach.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Inevitably, those with minority viewpoints, such as the third of teenagers today who have no religious affiliation, Jewish students, or even Christians who are not evangelical, become outsiders once school staff members lead students in prayer. Also, non-Christian prayers will have to be permitted on the same terms.

Already in Bremerton, a local Satanist group has expressed interest in conducting post-game religious ceremonies.

Those who are cheering for a ""win"" for Kennedy should fully consider the implications. Be careful what you wish for.

The solution to this acrimonious religious controversy has already been found. Decades of Supreme Court cases reaffirm the wisdom of separating state and church, especially in our public schools.

Elon Musk will not testify on ex-girlfriend Amber Heard’s behalf in her defense of a $50 million defamation lawsuit brought by Heard’s ex-husband Johnny Depp.

The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star filed the suit after the actress wrote an op-ed in 2018 saying she was ""a public figure representing domestic abuse."" She did not name Depp, but his lawyers argue that it's a reference to Depp since she has previously claimed he was physically violent toward her during their marriage.

Prince William had a panic button connected to local police that was installed in Kate Middleton’s apartment during the early days of their relationship.

The claim was made by former Vanity Fair Tina Brown, who recently wrote a bombshell book about the royals titled ""The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor – the Truth and the Turmoil."" It explores ""the scandals, love affairs, power plays and betrayals"" that have rocked the royals during the last 20 years and features new revelations based on Brown’s access to palace insiders.

The bestselling author previously wrote a biography on the Princess of Wales titled ""The Diana Chronicles,"" which was published in 2007. For her latest book, Brown said she spoke to more than 120 sources who were close to senior members of the royal family.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met in 2001 as students at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. William told The Telegraph they were friends for over a year before a relationship blossomed. While the tabloids reported that the couple called it quits in 2007, they had reportedly gotten back together later that year.

PRINCE WILLIAM WAS ‘APPALLED’ BY QUEEN ELIZABETH'S CHRISTMAS PHOTO SNUB OF PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE: BOOK

According to Brown, Middleton wasn’t entitled to official protection from the palace during their courtship.

""William reportedly arranged for a panic button to the local police station to be installed in her apartment to protect her from the constant threats of intrusion,"" Brown wrote.

She also shared that Middleton would sometimes receive assistance from Prince Charles’ former communications director, Paddy Harverson.

Working senior members of the royal family and their spouses are entitled to publicly-funded police protection. Middleton didn’t become entitled to police protection until she married the prince.

William proposed to Middleton in 2010 during their vacation to Kenya. The couple tied the knot in 2011. They share three children.

William’s younger brother, Prince Harry, had a whirlwind romance with Meghan Markle, a former American actress. They met in 2016 on a blind date and the relationship was said to have gone from ""0 to 60."" In 2017, the prince proposed, and the couple said ""I do"" in 2018.

Brown alleged that Harry wanted to marry the former ""Suits"" star ""as quickly as possible"" because he wanted her to have police protection.

Brown told Page Six that unlike Markle, Middleton, 40, was better prepared to handle the pressures of royal life.

""If for any reason, she thought like Meghan, ‘I’m out of here, I can do much better,’ it would be a disaster,"" Brown explained. ""It would, I think, crumble at the moment without her because she’s the only modern, beautiful woman who’s well-educated, substantial in herself, who’s actually wanting to commit herself to the rigors of this institution. Not many young women could do that.""

Brown clarified that the term ""Megxit,"" which was created by the press to describe the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s departure from royal life, is incorrect. She argued that it was Harry, 37, not Markle, 40, who suggested they should make their exit.

""I do think it’s wrongly called Megxit,"" said Brown. ""He wanted out and she enabled him to do what he wanted. She was strong enough to say, ‘You know what? You want out. I can make it happen.' He’s shown ever since that he absolutely hates that whole life, doesn’t like it.""

""If not but for Meghan, he wouldn’t have found a way out because he basically was a man who had everything done for him all of his life,"" Brown continued. ""He had never carved a life for himself. Meghan was very much a self-starter, a self-made successful woman. She knew who to call at Netflix. He wasn’t worldly like Meghan was worldly. They wanted to be global. If you want to be a global humanitarian superstar it’s going to take cash and that’s not going to be the same kind of money where you can live comfortably in Norfolk.""

PRINCE WILLIAM ‘WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE’ KATE MIDDLETON COULD HANDLE ROYAL LIFE BEFORE MARRIAGE, BOOK CLAIMS

A palace spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment concerning Brown’s book. However, a spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital that the palace doesn’t generally comment ""on such books."" A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also didn’t immediately reply to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s departures from royal duties began in 2020 over what they described as the British media’s intrusions and racist attitudes toward Markle. The family now resides in the coastal city of Montecito, California, with their two children.

In the wake of quitting royal duties, they gave an explosive TV interview to Oprah Winfrey in which the couple described painful comments about how dark Archie’s skin might be before his birth. The duchess talked about the intense isolation she felt inside the royal family that led her to contemplate suicide.

Buckingham Palace said the allegations of racism made by the couple were ""concerning"" and would be addressed privately.

""Being Mortal"" is based on the Atul Gawande book ""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End."" The initial release date was set for 2023, and it is unclear at this point if the pause in production will affect the release.

Lui said she didn't want to ""get into the specifics,"" but mentioned a rehearsal performance Murray was not present for because he had to attend a family gathering. When he did show, however, Liu claims he began to ""hurl insults"" that ""kept going on and on,"" per The Hollywood Reporter.

""I was, like, ‘Wow, he seems like he’s looking straight at me.’ I couldn’t believe that it could be towards me, because what do I have to do with anything majorly important at that time?"" the actress recalled, explaining that she asked whether Murray was speaking directly to her as the conversation ""started to become a one-on-one communication.""

52,"100-year-old dead shark had meningitis, researchers say","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Researchers believe this could be a first.

Last month, a 100-year-old shark's body was found washed ashore near Newlyn Harbour in England. After studying the body, researchers believe that a brain infection, never before seen in this species of shark, may have been responsible for its death.

""During the post-mortem examination, the brain did look slightly discolored and congested and the fluid around the brain was cloudy, raising the possibility of infection,"" James Barnett, pathologist from the Cornwall Marine Pathology Team said. ""This was then confirmed on microscopic examination of the brain (histopathology). A species of Pasteurella, a bacteria, was isolated from the fluid and this may well have been the cause of the meningitis.""

Pathologists believe that the Greenland shark having meningitis caused the animal to leave its natural deep water habitat, according to a news release from the ZSL Institute of Zoology.

""The shark’s body was in poor condition and there were signs of hemorrhage within the soft tissue around the pectoral fins which, coupled with the silt found in her stomach, suggested she may well have live stranded,"" Barnett explained. ""As far as we’re aware, this is one of the first post-mortem examinations here in the UK of a Greenland shark and the first account of meningitis in this species.""

Project leader for ZSL's Cetacean Stranding Investigation Program Rob Deaville said, ""This unfortunate and extraordinary stranding has allowed us to get an insight into the life and death of a species we know little about. Discovering that this shark had meningitis is likely a world’s first, but the significance of this in terms of any wider stressors is unknown.""

53,Mystery Ram 1500 pickup with snorkel revealed in patent,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

There appears to be a new Ram pickup in the works that's definitely not the electric one coming in 2024.

The truck brand has received a patent for a uniquely-outfitted version of the Ram 1500 that it describes as a ""new design.""

The patent uncovered by Fox News Autos was published in April and shows what appears to be a new version of the Ram 1500 Rebel equipped with some interesting off-road gear.

Along with a redesigned grille that incorporates a row of auxiliary lighting, the pickup features a built-in winch, fender flares with exposed bolts and a large air intake snorkel that wouldn't be needed on an electric vehicle.

Snorkels are used on off-road vehicles to help prevent dirt and water from getting into the engine. Chevrolet currently offers one from the factory on the Colorado ZR2 Bison as will Ford on the upcoming Bronco Everglades.

54,Mothers rallying to recall LA DA George Gascon say he ‘does not care about victims’; DA defends reforms,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Three Los Angeles-area mothers who lost their children to violent crime told Fox News they are pushing to recall Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon because he does not care about victims.

""I think he empathizes with every criminal out there and not with us. What did we do?"" asked Imelda Hernandez whose son, Christian David Silva, was shot and killed in February 2020.

""What does he think we’re going to do to him if we sit across the table?"" she continued. ""How come he doesn’t want to hear us out?

The recall campaign's organizers have said Gascon's policies are ""soft on crime,"" and that he should be ousted to ""keep communities safe."" The campaign announced last week that it had gathered 350,000 signatures. Nearly 567,000 are needed by the July 6 deadline.

LA DA GEORGE GASCON CAUSING ‘HAVOC AND MAYHEM,’ RECALL EFFORT WILL BE A ‘PHOTO FINISH,’ DEPUTY DA SAYS

Hernandez told Fox News she participated in two virtual meetings with Gascon, but said he ""just reads from a prompter.""

This is the second recall attempt Gascon has faced since he took office in December 2020. The 2021 attempt didn't gather enough signatures by the filing deadline to go to a vote.

Hernandez, who worked on the first recall attempt, has since moved to Orange County, where she's helping with District Attorney Todd Spitzer's reelection campaign. Spitzer's campaign slogan is #NoLAinOC.

""We have to have some kind of law and order,"" Emma Rivas told Fox News. ""George Gascon just doesn’t care about victims.""

Rivas’ son, Christopher Beasley, was shot and killed in 2016 when he was 25. Rivas has since become a board member of the Los Angeles chapter of Parents of Murdered Children.

She said she regrets voting for Gascon in 2020.

""I have voter's remorse,"" Rivas told Fox News. ""I’m ashamed because I didn’t do my research.""

She frequently attends Gascon recall rallies.

""I’m here because I regret voting for you,"" she told Fox News. ""But now that I have the opportunity to remove you, that’s exactly what I’m doing.""

Gascon issued a series of directives after taking office in December 2020 that have come under scrutiny.

Some include ordering his deputy district attorneys to stop seeking enhancement allegations, which can significantly extend prison sentences, not seeking the death penalty and barring prosecutors from charging juveniles as adults, regardless of the severity of the allegations.

Gascon's office defended his actions and his support for victims in a statement provided to Fox News.

""District Attorney Gascón's top priorities have been community safety and increasing support for victims,"" the statement said. ""This includes strengthening the Bureau of Victim Services and seeking serious penalties for serious crimes.""

""The false dichotomy between reform and caring for victims is just that – false,"" the statement continued. ""Justice should be about accountability and healing, not politics.""

During the campaign, Gascon responded to a Ballotpedia survey saying ""LA County deserves a more effective and progressive DA that enhances community safety without over incarcerating our communities.""

""I think it’s very important, people should realize when a DA runs for office, and he says ‘reform’ and ‘progressive’ and ‘science and data,’ watch out, because he’s not for you, he’s not for the public,"" Rivas said.

Another victim's mother, Anna Estevez, told Fox News: Gascon ""doesn’t see the trauma, the agony and the destruction that losing a child causes.""

Estevez's 5-year-old son, Aramazd Andressian Jr., was murdered by his father, her ex-husband, in 2017.

Gascon ""is pro-criminal, and I disagree wholeheartedly with his philosophy,"" Estevez told Fox News.

""What’s happening in LA County—I do not wish this to happen to your county, if you still have a county that’s civilized,"" Hernandez said. ""Do not be fearmongered by thinking differently on how you can change your community and your city.""

Estevez told Fox News that removing Gascon will not immediately fix Los Angeles' crime issues.

""With public support, I believe that we can reduce crime,"" she said. ""I believe that we can have a safe community.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mothers-recall-los-angeles-da-george-gascon-does-not-care-about-victims
55,LA RIOTS 30TH ANNIVERSARY: Lifelong Los Angeles resident recounts what she witnessed as a child,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

On the 30th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots that shook America in 1992, we asked Triawna Wood, a lifelong Los Angeles resident, for her thoughts and insights.

Los Angeles erupted after the Simi Valley jury acquitted Officers Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Briseno for the beating of Rodney King. The riots lasted six days and when the smoke cleared, 63 people were killed, 2,383 were injured and more than 12,000 were arrested. The property damage was estimated to be well over $1 billion.

Wood was four and a half years old and living with her family in the Jordan Downs projects in the Watts neighborhood when the riots erupted. Today, she is a married Army veteran who homeschools her three children.

What follows is a Q&A that has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear Wood in her own words.

Q: Where were you when the Los Angeles riots began?

A: I was in preschool. My mom picked me up from school, we were coming back home. My normal routine was my mom would watch soap operas and once the soap operas went off, I knew that was my time to watch cartoons. But the soap operas got interrupted by the verdict. And I'm like, ""How long is this going to last? I want to see my shows.""

I remember my brother and sister coming home, my dad coming home, and then I guess hours later, you just started hearing noises outside. People were just outside, more than normal because it was usually pretty quiet. At this time we were living in the back, the very far back of the Jordan Downs projects, right before you got to Alameda. If there was like an earthquake, or random gunshots on a normal day, we would always go to the stairwell in the middle of the house, for safety, for shelter. I remember, specifically that night, spending that entire night curled up in my dad's lap on the upper part of the stairs, in the stairwell. The whole night, I fell asleep in his lap.

I'VE LIVED IN LA MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND I DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE

And then so the next day, my parents tried to tell us about what was going on. My brother and sister were old enough to understand more than I was. And they explained to me like, ""You're not going to school the rest of the week—at least, until they tell us when you can come back."" I was like, ""Okay."" So, we just pretty much hunkered down for most of the week.

Throughout the week, I remember my mom's friend bringing us groceries because she didn't live in the city. Because we couldn't come up here to this part of the neighborhood to go to the store, because this was the only grocery store in the area.

I remember the aftermath, the fallout later. After reemerging back into the world and looking at all the mom and pop shops, the liquor stores just boarded up or torn apart. And I remember thinking, as a little tiny four- or five-year-old, what do you make of this?

Q: What was the most vivid memory that you had?

A: The most vivid memory was learning that my family members, or people who were close to our family, weren't as savory of characters as I thought they were. I think that was the first time, specifically, a close relative of ours, I saw him in a different light. It was a person that I always thought was very protective, nice, funny. I didn't realize that this person was also into gang activity and took advantage of a time that was so violent, really. I think that was the first time that I saw him like that.

He wasn't mean when he came by our house or anything like that, but for him to offer ill-gotten goods, we were kind of like the black Brady Bunch. We were the wholesome family — in church every day, every week, year round. But that was the first time I had that interaction and was like, ""Oh, we do know people that's like the bad people you see on TV."" And that gave me a sense of the world is bigger than what I was aware of.

Q: Did you understand the anger of the rioters or were you more concerned with upholding law and order?

A: I remember my dad sitting down, explaining to me through his own stories of police harassment. And I started to understand like, ""Okay, I know now that some people are going to treat me differently, because of how I look.""

But, at the same time, I remember playing through my head, because I'd seen news clips of the Rodney King video, and I'm like, ""Well, but if he was doing something bad, aren't they supposed to beat him up and arrest him?"" But I didn't know that there should have been limits then. And so just putting all the puzzle pieces together as a young kid is like, ""Oh. So, you don't just beat somebody bloody and then arrest them."" But that's what I thought because that's what you see on TV, but you didn't expect to see it for real in life. And that was the first time that I realized, art imitates life.

Q: What do you think is the biggest lesson to be learned from the riots?

A: One thing I think people did take from it is: maybe we shouldn't destroy our own stuff. But I don't think that should have been the only thing that people should have took from it. I think that if we learn to look at things as not just black and white, but more nuanced on an individual basis and pause before we react, maybe we can think of a stronger way to react that has a better impact for a better outcome.

Q: Do you think the rioting sent a message or do you think it hurt the black community?

A: I think it hurt more. But I think it also came out of hurt. It just became this vicious revolving door of just pain on top of pain. Because of not knowing how to process that pain in a healthy way.

Q: Has the LAPD improved in the years since the riots?

A: To be honest, they said that they were making improvements. I've met with a few officers and chiefs over the years for various different reasons. Some of them, their hearts seem like it's in the right place. But I don't think that they've had maybe enough opportunities to really engage in the change, in the process of actually becoming better. And I think that's because, one, the community has no trust. And two, a lot of younger officers … that started to replace the ones that were retiring, had no interest in the community that they're serving. And I think if there is improvement to be made, that's where it starts — in forging a relationship with the people of the community.

One thing I learned from being in the service, when I was in the Army before I was supposed to go to Afghanistan, you’d have months on top of months of training. You're learning the language, you're learning about the people, you're learning about their customs. What's considered okay, what's not okay. How to behave, how to talk to people, how to shake hands. Before you even set foot on the plane, you need to understand all of these things. And I think the police could take a chapter out of that book. How can you protect and serve a group of people that you really don't understand at all?

Q: The Los Angeles riots changed Los Angeles forever. How did it change the city? How did it change you?

A: It was one of many experiences or events in my life that was another drop in the bucket that basically solidified an idea in my head that I live in a country that never really cared about people who look like me. And that's hard to sit with, and I felt that pain and that anger for years, before I was able to even really process it.

But as far as changing the city? Yeah, I think it changed the city a lot. Especially the black community because it's living through a trauma that never gets acknowledged, never is openly talked about. So there's never room to heal from it, but that's the black experience throughout American history.

But as far as the city at-large, I think it's changed how we provide security. Like the shopping center around here, back then there were no gates around it. There wasn't a time of night where everything just closed up, and there was no way in or out. And there's so many places like that. There's so many extra security measures, and I don't know if I necessarily feel safer because of that. And I think people take for granted the freedoms that we had in exchange for a false sense of security …

People were much more closed off after that. I think that's when I started to see the shift in people not getting to know their neighbors. Even growing up in the projects, even though my parents were strict, I wasn't allowed to just hang out and go and do whatever, but we knew the majority of our neighbors for rows and rows. Everybody knew each other because it was a community. I think after that, you started to see a decline in that sense of community. People stopped talking to each other for various reasons, but on a larger scale.

Q: It never recovered?

A: Never recovered. Even in the neighborhood I live in now, when we first moved there, I said hi to introduce myself. And people just looked at me like, ""The f***?"" Like, ""Who are you?"" And I'm like, ""Just saying hi, we just moved in."" People think that it's normal, but that's not what I grew up with.

Q: You talked about how you felt anger. Were you able to work through it or are you still working through it?

A: I didn't know that my dad had run-ins with the police before. I didn't know that was a reoccurring thing. And I didn't know that I would eventually experience similar things. Even on a milder scale, but still. And it was just kind of like, what do you do with that? So as a teenager—yeah, the angsty teen. But as a black teen, you're not allowed to express that because now you're a threat. So, it took me years to just work on me and realize that no matter what has happened in the world, what has happened throughout history, that does not dictate where I want to be and how I want to be. And it took me years to work through that, to process all of those emotions, how I viewed the world. It even took me a lot of changing my own perspective, time and time again. I actively sought to get out, to explore, because this couldn't be the only way of looking at life.

I think if there's anything to probably leave off with, it's that we all suffer some type of trauma or pain collectively. It's not just individually, and it's not just subjugated to the minority communities. It's always another perspective that's happening at the same time. And I think if we focus on learning to see how others perceive that same event or series of events and realize that we all suffered some type of trauma from it, we can connect on a deeper level of understanding, how it affected the individual and how it affected us at-large as a society. I think when you have shared pain, it makes you stronger. It makes it easier to bond. But we have to get out of our own individual pain first in order to experience that type of bond.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-riots-30th-anniversary-lifelong-los-angeles-resident-recounts-what-she-witnessed-as-a-child
56,LA RIOTS 30TH ANNIVERSARY: Former LAPD officer reflects on his experience,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

On the 30th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots that shook America in 1992, Fox News asked Michael P. Downing, a former top cop with the Los Angeles Police Department for his thoughts and insights.

Los Angeles erupted after the Simi Valley jury acquitted Officers Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno for the beating of Rodney King. The riots lasted six days. When the smoke cleared, 63 people were killed, 2,383 were injured and more than 12,000 were arrested. The property damage was estimated to be well over $1 billion.

Downing was a young man on the streets during the riots. He went on to serve 35 years with the LAPD and reached the department’s highest levels, including commanding officer, deputy chief, and interim chief of police.

What follows is a Q&A that has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear Downing in his own words.

Q: Where were you when the Los Angeles riots began?

A: I was a lieutenant assigned to 77th Division. I happened to be on vacation that week studying for the promotional exam and saw what was happening on the news. I immediately got in my car and drove to the station. I got off on Florence Avenue from the 110 freeway. There were gang members in the underpass as I was going through, there were gunshots all around.

I made it to the station. While I was on vacation, Lt. Mike Moulin had been put in my place, and I basically went into the station and got ready and went out to the command post at 52nd Street and Arlington Avenue.

(Note: The 77th Division was involved in the initial incident that sparked the riots. Two officers requested assistance in apprehending 16-year-old Seandel Daniels, who had thrown an object at their car. Moulin and approximately two dozen officers arrived to arrest Daniels. The gathering crowd became visibly upset at what they saw as the rough handling of Daniels. Moulin, fearing one of his outnumbered men would resort to deadly force, ordered his men to retreat.)

I'VE LIVED IN LA MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND I DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE

Q: Was the LAPD prepared for the possibility that its four officers would be acquitted for the beating of King?

A: We were worried that there was going to be isolated incidents throughout the city when the verdict was announced. There was some preparation. But you have to remember, back in that time, Police Chief Daryl Gates and Mayor Tom Bradley hadn’t spoken to one another in a couple of years. There was a good division between the mayor's office and the police department, and when we talk about putting credits in the bank and building trust with communities, it was strained. But I had no idea that it would light off like it did in terms of what we saw throughout the city.

Q: What was the most vivid memory you had?

A: It was a surreal scene for me to believe that we lived in the United States under a democracy, to see pure anarchy occurring before my eyes. To see black soot falling from the sky, to driving down streets and see gunfire come out of alleys, to see stores being looted, to see the Korean businessmen up on roofs defending their stores, firing weapons down, to seeing 52 dead bodies in a parking stall at the command post right next to the food truck that was feeding the cops and the first responders. That was a scene that was more conducive to what you would see in war than what you would see in a democratic society.

Q: Did you understand the anger of the rioters or were you more concerned with upholding law and order?

A: It's a balance. I was absolutely concerned with the anger. I was concerned hearing Bradley say: ""Go to the streets and voice your anger and show your anger."" That concerned me a little bit—a lot actually. I knew we had to restore order. I knew that it was anarchy, that it affected the entire city of Los Angeles. Buildings were burning, innocent people were getting hurt, police were getting hurt.

I knew that there was a balance. In public service and public safety and policing, we're not soldiers. We don't have enemies. We're public servants and most of the time, you control chaotic things by inspiring values and providing education and mobilizing resources.

In this case, cops had to become soldiers for a period of time and control through force and fear … When we have to become a different role and control through force and fear, we've failed in certain areas.

I was disappointed, I was disheartened, I was very sad at the scene that this had come to.

Q: How did other LAPD officers react to the acquittals of the officers involved in the beating of King?

A: Now that I've been retired for five years – I did 35 years with LAPD – I've come really to notice the division even within law enforcement on perspectives and opinions. More shocking than anything – and I think looking back to 1992 and listening to discussions in roll calls and discussions in locker rooms and discussions at the gas pumps at the time – I noticed that there was some division and different perspectives.

I don't know if it was freely talked about as much as it is today in different circles, and I think that's one of the big differences that I see today, especially with social media. You see the opinions of people that you never thought existed when you were on the department, especially in 1992. Had we had social media platforms, the Facebooks, the Instagrams, the Twitters, the LinkedIns back then, I think it would have been a lot more apparent, and not in a good way.

Q: What do you think is the biggest lesson to be learned from the riots?

A: We all know that democracy is fragile. I believe that the relationships with police in communities is fragile, that you will always have the cheerleaders, you'll always have the supporters, but you need to continually put credits in the bank with all communities. You can't just say ""the community"" today. It's communities because they're all different. They all have different experiences with government, with law enforcement, and you have to feed those communities with support, with services, with a voice, with interaction, with town hall meetings, with problem solving efforts, with access to government.

You can never stop because you know that a crisis is always on the horizon. You're always going to have a storm come, and you're going to have to take those credits out of the bank. You've got to make sure you're not bankrupt because, in 1992, we were bankrupt with certain communities in the city, and we didn't have any more stature.

(Note: The gang sweeps during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and during Operation Hammer, which began in 1987, led to the arrests of tens of thousands of people. Many were not charged.)

Social scientists believe that these things happen every 30 years. We certainly hope it doesn't happen like that today, but I do know that even when you look at Jan. 6, 2020, as kind of an analogy and leading up to the 2024 elections, I'm very worried about what could happen in this country.

I know the Joint Chiefs of Staff are very worried because they met about the potential for a civil war leading up to the 2024 election, and I know that's an extension of what we saw in 1992, but it's more of a national picture versus a localized picture.

The protests and demonstrations for this country are a good thing. For police and first responders and public servants to facilitate protests, so that they're orderly, so people can speak their mind and if they need to appeal or protest against a policy or a governmental procedure or something, that needs to be in place. There needs to be listening mechanisms in place and there needs to be some type of action taken to address them.

That's what our democracy was built on. If you suppress the ability to protest and demonstrate, you're going to have a pressure cooker type of problem where the lid is going to be blown off and you're going to have another riot.

VIDEO MONTAGE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY METRO SYSTEM SHOWS SHOOTINGS, ASSAULTS, PEOPLE THROWN ON TRAIN TRACKS

Q: Has the LAPD improved in the years since the riots?

A: I think the Los Angeles Police Department has improved in many ways. I think the one mechanism that really created a lot of evolution and improvement and reform within the police department was the consent decree that we were under for 10 years.

That really concerned me when we went through this whole debate about defunding the police and starting over. You can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Everybody knows that reform is a continual thing and that probably the greatest adversary we have is complacency and status quo. We can never have that.

But if you look at the type of organization, even back to the 1930s, where we were a politically controlled police department and then we went into a reform police department and then we went into the era of being a professional police department and then we went into the era of community-based policing police department and we've played with this other era of intelligence-led or predictive-led policing, but the foundation of policing is always based on communities.

The one principle that holds true is people are the police and police are the people. The police department has to reflect what the people look like, how they feel, what their values are. We can never move away from that idea.

Have we improved? When you look at the consent decree, 187 paragraphs of improvement were written in that consent decree. I think when we ended it 10 years later, we were somewhere in the neighborhood of 97% compliance.

There's always the potential to slip and go back or default back to where you were. That is eliminated by or mitigated by excellent leadership, by continually looking back and critiquing, by having people who don't necessarily agree with you, to have them be a voice and be reflective on that voice and listen to the critiques.

Civilian oversight is so important to the Los Angeles Police Department. I wish there was a better way to have civilian oversight where they weren't so much attached to the mayor's office and/or to city council but they did reflect the values of a civilian commission that would oversee and be the board of directors of a police department.

I think some of the problems that we've gone back to is we've become politicized … When you politicize a police department the way it's been politicized today, you see what happens in Los Angeles and you're seeing what's happening to it now. Crime is going up, violence is going up, and the physical stature of the community looks horrible with homeless encampments. It's not good for the homeless.

It's because the police hands have been tied and there hasn't been a plan and there hasn't been good leadership. We need to get back to the basics. Communities need to participate. We need to listen to communities. We need to create better partnerships in communities. We need to solve these quality of life problems and the big things will take care of themselves, but we need to get back to basics.

What concerns me is that if we don't and this continues to devolve and continues to whirl in this downward spiral, we're going to be back to where we were 30 years ago.

Q: How has the LAPD sought to become more reflective of its communities?

A: We got to a point where I believe that we didn't really have to say we have an affirmative action policy and we need these certain percentages in the department because we had those percentages and it was created through equal opportunity, through recruitment, through giving everybody opportunities for promotion.

I think we had to reflect that diversity up through the rank structure of LAPD, which is happening. A good example is my watch commander when I was a captain in the Hollywood Division. Before I retired, she became my boss. She was an assistant chief and I was a deputy chief. I was thrilled, because I had a little piece of that to give her, to see her succeed. It was fantastic.

I think when you look at the diversity of women on the police department, it looks pretty good. I think we have to improve a little bit when it comes to minorities. I think we always have those goals and I think there's opportunities for everyone now. It's not perfect. We need to continue to reform.

But there was a point where we had to say, ""Let's manage the diversity now so that we can reflect it up through the rank structure and let's not stigmatize it so that we create a system where we're just promoting people or recruiting people to fill a quota."" Because then that creates really a stigma against that person because there's a belief, ""Well, you only got this position because of your ethnicity or your gender."" That could be equally as damaging.

Q: The Los Angeles Riots changed Los Angeles forever. How did it change the city? How did it change you?

A. How it changed me? It made me believe that however good I thought we were, we had a long way to go and that we had a lot of improvement to do. And that sometimes you have to let go of being right and create enough room in the glass to listen to people, react to people, allow people to see change and reform take place and be accountable to that.

When you get inculcated in a culture, sometimes that culture doesn't serve you very well and you need outside influences to continually question what you're doing … to make sure that you don't get stuck in this groupthink type of mentality.

Are arrests a really good measure of success? I've learned that it's probably not. You know, leading up to the riots, we went through all these different initiatives, battle plans and operation plans and it didn't serve us very well, because it created more of a military mentality, a quasi-military mentality … We should be leaning much more toward public service and serving with a public servant's heart and understanding the nature of what communities really need and what they really want in terms of how we approach our job.

It made me think that's the type of leader that I want to be. I want to be an inclusive leader, a coach and somebody that listens to a variety of opinions.

How it changed the city … I think the city still is at the point where it's fragile and I think you've seen what's happened over the last nearly 10 years or so … If you take your eye off the ball, you're going to default back to what it was. I think that's what we're seeing right now.

In the 2000s, we had homicides that were under 300 per year, whereas in the '90s, they were almost over 1,000 I think a year. Obviously, 300 is way too many. One is way too many. The violence is starting to curb up again. The physical stature of the communities is starting to look bad again. There needs to be a reset. We need to refocus on how we're approaching this problem while still keeping compassion and empathy toward under-served communities and making sure we push social services and mental health and triage those communities.

It's this idea of how do we achieve this rule-based approach and a care-based approach so that we don't have anarchy but we don't have lack of freedoms as well, but that we provide inspiration to communities to become good partners, so that we're doing it together and it's not just a police department problem.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-riots-30th-anniversary-former-lapd-officer-reflects-on-his-experience
57,"LA DA George Gascon causing ‘havoc and mayhem,’ recall effort will be a 'photo finish,' deputy DA says","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A leading voice in the movement to oust Los Angeles County’s top prosecutor told Fox News the race to collect the number of signatures required to put a recall question on the ballot will come down to the wire.

""I believe that we will get the required signatures to get the recall of [District Attorney] George Gascon on the ballot,"" Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami said. ""However, it is going to be a photo finish.""

""It will be very close,"" he added. ""It is going to require the entire movement to keep working together until the last day, which is something I and all of us intend to do.""

This is the second recall attempt Gascon has faced since he took office in December 2020. A 2021 attempt didn't gather enough signatures by the filing deadline to go to a vote.

LOS ANGELES GASCON RECALL ORGANIZERS OPTIMISTIC AS MORE SIGNATURES KEEP COMING IN

""We have a district attorney right now who's causing havoc and mayhem in Los Angeles,"" Hatami told Fox News. ""He's hurting public safety here in Los Angeles.""

""His policies are making it more dangerous for individuals,"" he continued.

Gascon’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

The recall campaign announced it has gathered roughly 350,000 signatures to date. Organizers need to collect 566,857 signatures total – 10% of registered voters in the county – by the July 6 deadline.

Hatami, a child abuse prosecutor with 16-years of experience in the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, has been vocal about his support for booting Gascon.

""I think probably 99% of the people in Los Angeles would make a better DA than George Gascon,"" Hatami told Fox News.

After riding a wave of progressive candidates campaigning to head some of the nation's busiest DA offices, Gascon ousted his predecessor, Jackie Lacey, and immediately issued a series of directives that have come under heavy scrutiny.

Some include ordering his deputy district attorneys to stop seeking enhancement allegations, which can significantly extend prison sentences, not seeking the death penalty and barring prosecutors from charging juveniles as adults, regardless of the severity of the allegations.

""I had heard about George Gascon and the type of person he was,"" Hatami said. ""But I guess in my heart, I thought … somebody who was a DA in San Francisco, who was a police officer for 30 years, he wouldn't do this.""

The directive related to juveniles has since been modified after the case of Hannah Tubbs, a 26-year-old transgender woman who at 17 sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl. Tubbs was sentenced to two years in a youth facility and was caught on a jailhouse phone call bragging about the light punishment.

LA DA GEORGE GASCON KNEW ABOUT TRANS CHILD MOLESTER HANNAH TUBBS JAIL CALLS BEFORE SENTENCING, DEPUTY DA SAYS

""It broke me … to give somebody who molested a child six months to two years. It's heartless,"" said Hatami, who told Fox News the victim’s family had reached out to him on the case. ""He is not a good person. This is not political. He may say it is, but it’s not.""

Violent crime is up 7.2% from this time last year, according to Los Angeles Police Department data. Total arrests are down 15.1%.

More than 9 of 10 Los Angeles prosecutors supported an effort to recall Gascon , the Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys reported in February.

During a press conference in December, Gascon defended his progressive policies.

""Rather than turning every tragedy into a political football and blame game, I ask that those people please join us,"" said Gascon. ""We can do better, we will go further if we all work together.""

Despite working in the same building as Gascon in downtown Los Angeles, Hatami told Fox News he has never met his boss.

""I don't know how to describe the working relationship because most bosses that I've had have taken the time to come out and meet their employees,"" Hatami said. ""I'm one of the top child abuse prosecutors here in Los Angeles, and George Gascon has never tried one single case, and so you would think somebody like that would come down here and meet with me.""

""I’ve publicly said I’ll debate him, if he wants to do that,"" Hatami continued. ""My door is always open.""

58,Oklahoma leaders give exclusive look into their Supreme Court arguments,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Oklahoma governor, attorney general and solicitor general gave Fox News an inside look into their arguments in their U.S. Supreme Court case over state sovereignty.

The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a case regarding whether Oklahoma has the authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes on reservations against Indians. The state argued that it should be allowed to serve justice for its citizens and that the federal and tribal governments can't keep up with the number of crimes committed. Oklahoma tribes have said those claims are untrue and undermine tribal sovereignty.

""We have crimes without punishment. We have victims without justice,"" Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor told Fox News. ""If somebody steals the car of a Native American, they might as well forget it because there's no law enforcement that's going to be able to come and help them because the state of Oklahoma can't.""

JUSTICES TO HEAR OKLAHOMA APPEAL IN TRIBAL JURISDICTION CASE

Gov. Kevin Stitt told Fox News: ""We're asking the Supreme Court for the authority to protect law and order in Oklahoma. We have lost the ability, as a state, to prosecute crimes when there's a native victim.""

""We want to be able to protect every single person in eastern Oklahoma regardless of their race,"" he said. ""The state should be able to prosecute those crimes, and right now we have simply lost that jurisdiction.""

The case, Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, centers on Victor Castro-Huerta, a non-native who was convicted in an Oklahoma Court of neglecting his 5-year-old Native American stepdaughter while living on the Cherokee Nation reservation. The state's highest criminal appeals court overturned Castro-Huerta's conviction in 2021, finding that Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction.

Oklahoma Solicitor General Mithun Mansinghani, who attended Wednesday's hearing, left feeling optimistic that the Court would side with the state.

""I think the justices were very engaged with the arguments here,"" he told Fox News. ""And because we're confident that we're right in the law, I'm confident that the justices will see it our way.""

Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., however, felt the law was on the tribal government's side.

""Congress has been clear on the limits of state jurisdiction on our reservations, and Governor Stitt’s anti-tribal views don’t change those facts,"" Hoskin said in a statement released after the oral arguments.

""While tribes have worked closely with our partners to meet our public safety responsibilities and provide a blanket of protection to everyone on our reservation, it’s unfortunate that the state has wasted time and resources attacking our rights and sovereignty,"" the statement continued.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % C CITIGROUP INC. 48.71 +0.50 +1.04%

""We’re selling our consumer and our commercial banking franchise on the ground there, and we’re in active dialog around that,"" Fraser said in a Bloomberg Television interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference.

Investors have been worried that the sale was in limbo because of economic sanctions western nations have imposed to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

REPUBLICANS PUSH HOUSE TO DROP CITIGROUP AS OFFICE CREDIT CARD PROVIDER OVER FUNDING FOR ABORTION TRAVEL

Fraser announced in April 2021 that Citi would divest its Russia consumer business along with a dozen other consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA markets that she said were too small to keep. Citi has since found buyers for many of those businesses.

Fraser also said in the interview that Citigroup will continue to serve multi-national corporations in Russia because they need the bank to shutdown their businesses there.

""We’ve stopped soliciting new business, new clients. We’re clearly shrinking down our exposures, our business,"" Fraser said. ""But you're kind of the captain who’s the last one off the ship.""

Earlier in the day, Fraser said in a panel discussion at the conference that western countries' use of sanctions as a weapon against Russia is prompting some of Citi's international clients to explore new ways to conduct trade and finance.

CITI NAMES ANGEL NG AS HEAD OF ASIA PACIFIC FOR GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT

In the Middle East, Fraser said, ""you hear the clients there talk about the fact that they don't trust the western financial order to put all of their eggs in that basket going forward, that they are going to be looking at other places.""

Fraser added: ""You have to anticipate the splintering of the old global financial order, the acceleration of new venues.""

Citigroup is the most internationally diversified of big banks based in the United States. It provides trade finance to corporations and wealth management to billionaires around the world.

60,Activist investor Ancora has 1% Hasbro stake,"An activist investor has a stake in Hasbro Inc. and is supporting another activist already waging a proxy fight at the toy maker while it pushes the company to make further changes.

Ancora Holdings Inc. has a roughly 1% stake in Hasbro and wants it to explore a full or partial sale of Entertainment One, its unit focused on creating television shows and other content, according to a letter the activist sent to the company’s board that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. It also wants the company to replace longstanding directors on its board.

Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro has a market value of roughly $12.5 billion and sells brands including Play-Doh and Monopoly. While it received a boost in the early days of the pandemic as lockdowns spurred parents to spend on toys, its shares are trading below where they were five years ago.

DON'T BET AGAINST AMAZON: FMR. TOYS 'R' US CEO

Ancora joins Alta Fox Capital Management LLC, a little-known activist that in February unveiled a 2.5% stake in Hasbro and nominated five directors to the company’s board. Alta Fox urged the company to explore a spinoff of its fast-growing Wizards of the Coast gaming unit, which includes games like Dungeons & Dragons. It also criticized the company’s roughly $4 billion 2019 purchase of Entertainment One, which is known for the children’s show ""Peppa Pig.""

Ancora said in its letter Hasbro should replace longstanding directors with Alta Fox’s nominees. The activist also said Hasbro should review options for Entertainment One because it doesn’t fit well with the rest of the business and proceeds from a sale could be reinvested elsewhere. Ancora also said Hasbro should continually consider alternatives for the Wizards of the Coast unit, which it believes the market is overlooking.

Hasbro in early April rejected Alta Fox’s calls to spin off Wizards of the Coast, concluding that doing so would diminish benefits the division gets from the company’s long-standing strategy which focuses on telling stories around its brands. It also added two directors to its board, an executive from chat app-company Discord Inc. and a former executive of gaming company Electronic Arts Inc. Chris Cocks took over as Hasbro chief executive in February following the death last year of longtime CEO Brian Goldner.

Hasbro said in a statement that Alta Fox’s campaign began shortly after Goldner’s death and ""is a distraction at a time when our new CEO should be given a chance to focus solely on our business.""

Hasbro shareholders are set to vote on the competing director slates June 8, unless the two sides settle before then.

The activist pressure comes as Hasbro’s rival Mattel Inc. has held talks with private-equity firms about a potential sale, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. The two have been fierce competitors over the years and in 2017, Hasbro made an unsuccessful takeover offer for Mattel.

62,China's COVID lockdowns are a symptom of deeper problems,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

What a difference a year makes. In the spring of 2021, China was reporting only a few dozen COVID cases each day and celebrating a return to steady economic growth. The United States, meanwhile, reeled from its worst death wave of the pandemic.

Media outlets around the world, from the Chinese Ministry of Propaganda to the New York Times, were quick to declare that China had ""won"" the pandemic, having decisively defeated the virus and demonstrated the virtues of unbridled autocracy. Xi Jinping was set to use China’s apparent COVID success as a central argument for enshrining himself, at the upcoming Communist Party Congress in October 2022, as emperor-for-life.

Fast-forward to today. While most Americans travel mask-free around their country, several hundred million Chinese citizens are locked down in their apartments, many without reliable access to food or medical care. Reports of people dying at home of easily treatable ailments are proliferating, as are videos of desperate residents screaming for help and clashing with police.

SHANGHAI TESTS TO LOOSEN COVID LOCKDOWN

With one out of every four Chinese citizens under lockdown and 87 of China’s 100 largest cities imposing some form of restriction on movement, supply chains have ground to a halt. Some leading economists think China could suffer zero growth or even an economic contraction this year—compounding what was already a decade-long trend of slowing growth, declining productivity, and surging debt.

China’s COVID debacle is a symptom of deeper problems. Under Xi, China’s already-autocratic system has veered toward a personalistic totalitarianism that makes it hard for the country to shift course when the supreme leader is committed to a bad idea—such as a ""zero COVID"" policy that has condemned the country to repeated, growth-killing lockdowns. Nor can China vaccinate its way out of the pandemic. Its biotech sector cannot match the West’s success in crafting mRNA-enabled wonder drugs, and Xi’s growing antagonism toward the outside world has made the idea of protecting the population with American or European vaccines a non-starter.

prev next Image 2 of 3

The pandemic, moreover, is accentuating the excruciating demographic crunch caused by China’s long-time one-child policy, bringing forward the date at which the country’s population will peak and then begin a catastrophic, productivity-crushing decline.

SHANGHAI WARNS RESIDENTS WHO VIOLATE COVID LOCKDOWN WILL FACE PUNISHMENT: REPORT

China’s predicament today is simply a preview of what it will face in the coming decade, as a host of long-building economic, political, and demographic bills come due.

Some Americans might be tempted to gloat over China’s COVID woes, but they should resist the urge. Slowing growth and worsening societal problems lockdowns might make China a less competitive long-term rival to the United States: The odds of Beijing effortlessly displacing Washington as the world’s most powerful country are actually quite slim. Yet those same problems could also make China a more explosive near-term threat.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

As we show in our forthcoming book, ""Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China,"" the most dangerous countries are not rising powers but peaking powers: Countries that want to reorder the world but are losing confidence that time is on their side.

When once-rising powers run into persistent economic stagnation, they typically become more repressive at home and more repressive abroad. Japan, for instance, turned toward totalitarianism and began its military rampage across Asia after the economic crises of the 1920s and then the Great Depression ended its long run of prosperity. China seems to be headed down the same ugly path today.

Since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, slowing Chinese growth has gone hand-in-hand with efforts to dominate the resource-rich South China Sea, lock up markets and commodities through the Belt and Road Initiative, and carve out a technological sphere of influence encompassing much of the developing world. Since the onset of COVID, Beijing has become more belligerent still.

Xi’s government has conducted menacing military exercises near Taiwan, sparking a deadly border clash with India, and issuing chilling threats to use nuclear weapons against Japan. Even before Russia attacked Ukraine, U.S. military officials had begun to warn, publicly, that China could launch a major war in the Western Pacific—probably against Taiwan—in the next few years.

Western observers have often interpreted growing Chinese assertiveness as a sign of growing Chinese confidence. But it may simply represent Xi’s increasing willingness to use coercion and force to secure China’s objectives, as he becomes less convinced that Beijing can peacefully overtake its rivals.

More than two years into the pandemic, Americans should be thankful that they don’t live in a police state where the most heavy-handed COVID crackdowns appear likely to persist well into the future. But they should also be alert to the fact that the danger of war may increase, rather than decrease, as China peaks and begins to decline.

Critics took to social media to mock Juan, with some pointing out the maskless photo, and others her decision to attend the event and remain there despite her expressed concerns.

""Were you being held hostage?"" wrote Charles C.W. Cooke, senior writer at the National Review, with Christina Pushaw, press secretary for Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, responding with the maskless photo of Juan and saying, ""Doesn't look like it.""

65,SCOTUS draft leak likely a liberal clerk seeking to stop an overturn of Roe v. Wade: Dershowitz,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The bombshell leak of an apparent draft of a decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade is likely the product of an ideologically leftist law clerk seeking either to halt a nixing of the abortion ban or to engender support for court-packing, Alan Dershowitz told Fox News.

The leaked draft, written in February, was reportedly crafted by George W. Bush-appointed Justice Sam Alito.

Dershowitz, a longtime Harvard Law professor, said he strongly opposes overturning the 1973 ruling, but emphasized this leak is an egregious violation of legal ethics.

SUPREME COURT DRAFT OPINION LEAKS

""I know Justice Alito, I know his writings. This sounds like a decision, a majority decision of the Supreme Court overruling Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

""And I have a theory and it's only a theory: I think this was leaked by a liberal law clerk who is trying to change the outcome of the case – either by putting pressure on some justices to change their mind or by getting Congress to pack the court even before June, which is very unlikely.""

DERSHOWITZ: MUELLER REPORT ‘SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN’

Thirdly, Dershowitz stated, the leak could be intended to pressure Congress to federally codify Roe v. Wade's abortion ban and prevent the future legality of states enacting their own abortion laws.

Moments thereafter, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, publicly demanded Roe indeed be passed into law or that the filibuster be killed in order to do so with 50 votes.

Dershowitz told ""Hannity"" that he believes the draft is indeed authentic and that the leaker definitely wants to change the outcome of the forthcoming opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson, Mississippi, Women's Health Organization.

The case in question focuses on the Constitutionality of a 2018 law in the Magnolia State banning abortion after 15 weeks.

Later, Dershowitz added that the leaker could be considering themselves engaged in ""civil disobedience"", despite the possibility they will be disbarred, fired from the Supreme Court among other punishments.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/supreme-court-roe-wade-draft-leak-dershowitz-law-clerk-alito

Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued sabre-rattling about detonating a nuclear weapon in his war on Ukraine is a danger not felt worldwide since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Geraldo Rivera said on ""Piers Morgan Uncensored.""

In an interview with Fox Nation host Piers Morgan, Rivera said the mutually-assured-destruction dynamic that prevents such dangers is at risk with an ""insane"" autocrat like the former KGB agent at the top of the Kremlin.

""How it ends, I have no idea, but the nuclear sabre-rattling has rattled me as a child of the 1950s who used to duck under our desks at school in nuclear drills that would have been fruitless,"" he said.

SEXTON CALLS OUT BIDEN'S DISINFO BOARD HYPOCRISY

""[A man] who lived through as a cadet in Maritime College, the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the worst it's been since then. People have to understand when people are talking about nuclear or use of nuclear weapons in a way that it is plausible, if remote, it is unnerving to me.""

Rivera further reported on rumblings that Putin may fire a ""tactical"" nuke that would detonate over an unpopulated area like the middle of the Black Sea as a ""demonstration"", calling it further example of his insanity.

The ""Five"" host went on to hearken back to grade school and was reminded of something a civics teacher told him that shook him at the time.

Rivera said the teacher once told him thar Adolf Hitler – if given the choice between suicide or taking an action to end the world – he would have chosen the latter.

Rivera said he fears the same may be true for Putin, who he said appears to be losing in Ukraine after abandoning his quest for Kyiv and instead fighting mercilessly in the Donbas and coastal regions.

""Is Putin now playing with the button because he may lose this ridiculous, stupid war?"" he asked.

Rivera praised the Ukrainian government for its handling of the invasion, and also criticized former President Donald Trump for what he saw as actions seeking to undermine NATO, citing in one case the then-president's concern over nations not paying their 2% commitment.

""He was so disparaging of them, and it sounded like he wanted the Atlantic Alliance gone -- that he didn't even think the United States should be in the in NATO. What if there was no NAITO now?"" he asked.

The advent of the Department of Homeland Security's ""Disinformation Governance Board"" is the latest in a ""chilling"" record of counter-First-Amendment behavior, he said.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, however, defended the board, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" he could have done a better job in communicating what it does.

On ""The Five"", Gutfeld said the board has more to do with competition than speech itself.

DISINFO BOARD BETTER SUITED FOR DICTATORSHIPS: GABBARD

""They don't like their freedom of speech to have any competition. They think, I believe, that they see speech as a zero-sum game -- if Joey has more speech, then that means somebody at MSNBC has less speech. That's the way they see it. That's why it's wrong,"" he said.

Gutfeld added that the controversy also shows establishment media understands that they are in decline, and that other free speech could be a threat to their ecosystem:

""I think the legacy media … know that it just it's not too far off from being dead … They're watching their numbers decline. And every time there's a threat, they go crazy.""

He added that, while many see Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the chief concern among the anti-free-speech left, such proverbial risks to the establishment dynamic have been recurring for some time.

Gutfeld said that as far back as October 1996, that dynamic felt threatened by the conception of Fox News Channel, and later, journalists like Glenn Greenwald and commentators like Joe Rogan.

""Now it's Musk. So every reaction you see is the same. They fear speech because it competes with theirs,"" he said, adding that Mayorkas notably stated the new disinformation apparatus will work against speech's ""connectivity to violence.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/gutfeld-dhs-disinfo-board-left-free-speech

An effort to counter illegal immigration in Texas will receive another $500 million in funding through the end of the year, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced last week.

The money will be redirected from state agencies to Operation Lone Star, which went into effect a year ago. The program is a joint mission between the National Guard soldiers and troopers with the state Department of Public Safety.

""Texas will not sit on the sidelines as President Biden continues turning a blind eye to the crisis at our southern border,"" Abbott said in a statement Friday. ""Texans’ safety and security is our top priority, and we will continue fighting to keep our communities safe. This additional funding ensures the Lone Star State is fully equipped to provide Texans the border security strategy they demand and deserve.""

Texas has been especially aggressive in trying to combat the surge of illegal crossings into the state, going so far as to bus apprehended migrants to Washington D.C., in what opponents have called a public relations stunt.

Lieutenant Governor Patrick said the federal government's failure to secure the southern border has forced Texas to ""use our tax dollars to step into the breach.""

Human remains were discovered in a barrel over the weekend at the bottom of Nevada’s drought-stricken Lake Mead, according to officials.

The gruesome discovery came as water levels at the lake have reached their lowest levels in more than half a century. The reservoir’s original water intake valve was exposed for the time a few days ago, rendering pump stations inoperable.

Boaters spotted the barrel on the newly exposed bottom of Lake Mead Sunday afternoon. National Park Service rangers searched an area near the lake's Hemenway Harbor and found the barrel containing skeletal remains.

Officials predicted the discovery could be just the first of more grim finds.

""I would say there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains,"" Las Vegas police Lt. Ray Spencer told KLAS-TV on Monday.

Personal items found inside the barrel indicated the person died more than 40 years ago in the 1980s, Spencer said. He declined to discuss a cause of death and declined to describe the items found, saying the investigation is ongoing.

Police plan to reach out to experts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to analyze when the barrel started eroding. The Clark County coroner's office will try to determine the person's identity.

Fox News has reached out to the National Park Service for more details but did not hear back before press time.

A small Utah-based nonprofit has been traveling to Ukraine refugee centers inside the war-torn country to deliver goods and necessities that haven't been addressed by larger organizations.

""Where we see our niche is being able to get in there quickly, identify things that aren't being done or that may not be addressed by the bigger organizations and then try to fill those needs,"" Bruce Roberts, CEO of the humanitarian-focused nonprofit August Mission, told Fox News Digital.

The group was founded less than a year ago after U.S. forces pulled out of Afghanistan.

Roberts, who served as a member of the U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan and had friends there ""felt like the way that we pulled out left a lot of people behind and created a tough situation for people that we had made promises to."" In order to try to live up to their commitments, Roberts, his former interpreter and a few others ""started doing what we could to help get people out and to get humanitarian aid in.""

For Roberts, it felt like meaningful work.

""After retiring from the military I felt repurposed,"" he said.

When the war in Ukraine erupted, Roberts knew what the next mission was going to be.

Roberts said the general mission in Ukraine was to support refugees and displaced persons and provide humanitarian assistance.

Although the group wouldn't be able to feed a camp of a million refugees, Roberts knew they could ""get into a refugee camp in Ukraine, ask them what they need and then deliver it.""

""That's exactly what we're doing,"" he said. ""We're trying to be more surgical.""

A 33-year-old artist diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes set out on a mission to walk 470 miles across three states this month.

Krista Sheneman's goal is to inspire other people who are also battling diabetes by showing them that the condition can't stop someone from being active or accomplishing their goals.

Sheneman was first diagnosed with diabetes around five years ago, and she says it was a wake-up call. Since then, Sheneman told Fox News Digital, health has become a huge part of her life.

BROOKLYN-BASED NONPROFIT DELIVERS 'BLANKETS OF HOPE' TO PEOPLE IN NEED

What she realized while battling this condition, though, is that a lot of people weren't aware of what she went through on a daily basis.

""Which is crazy to think [about] because there are so many diabetics out there,"" she said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 37 million Americans have diabetes and between 90%-95% of them have Type 2 diabetes.

So, Sheneman came up with an art project that would offer insight into what diabetics go through.

On April 1, she started her journey from her college town of Cincinnati, Ohio, and her plan is to make it to her hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, by the end of the month.

Throughout this journey, people will be able to watch her glucose levels through an app that's connected to her glucose monitor, the Dexcom G6. The monitor provides real-time alerts when her glucose levels fluctuate too high or low.

This journey is more than just showing people how physically difficult this walk is, she said.

""I want them to understand what it looks like to be diabetic and constantly checking and making sure that you're eating the right things,"" she said, adding that ""just something as simple as stress can raise your blood sugar.""

Sheneman was told by health professionals to do something simple, like walking, every day.

""They want you to kind of get out there and manage your health,"" she says.

However, Sheneman, who grew up backpacking, wanted to test the limits of what was possible.

""Walking and backpacking and these things to get from point A to point B were already ingrained in me,"" she said. ""And I was concerned that as a diabetic I wasn't going to be able to do these things.""

To train for her walk, Sheneman spent eight hours a day on a treadmill while managing her diabetes with her glucose monitor.

""I think it's important to understand that it's not necessarily limiting you,"" she said. ""There's just the creative hump that you have to get over.""

78,MSNBC's Joy Reid and all critical race theory advocates owe our children an apology,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Critical race theory and its proponents have dominated American society for more than four years. From corporations to classrooms, it's everywhere and yet, those same proponents shout ‘racism’ when folks like myself have grave concerns over its effects on not just our nation, but our nation’s future: our children.

Functioning as more than a simple curriculum, CRT has resulted in the unfair treatment of underserved kids; brainwashing them to believe things like poor academic achievement and mediocracy is sufficient based on their ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Fundamentally, CRT is harming our nation’s youth through the promotion of segregation, the degradation of academic aptitude, and the denial of the American Dream.

BIDEN ADMIN WAS ‘ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING’ STATES TO USE COVID MONEY TO PUSH CRT, SAYS ONE NATION PRESIDENT

I have seen first-hand the results of CRT on some of our nation’s most vulnerable youth at my organization, the Jack Brewer Foundation. My kids—often from broken homes without fathers—are often told in school that their F’s are ""good"" because of their socioeconomic status and their race. These schools don’t address the deficiencies in math or struggles in reading—where some of these kids are at a reading level which is three to four grades behind—and yet they still are pushed through the school system. There is no extra programming or specialized training to even attempt to address their learning impairments.

No child, regardless of race, should receive a D or F on a report card and have a teacher insist that they have made satisfactory progress due to demographics. However, this is the residuals of critical race theory where your expected aptitude is based solely on your skin color.

Given the reality my kids are facing, you would expect the mission of the Jack Brewer Foundation to not only be uncontroversial but championed by Americans across the political spectrum and throughout the country. In fact, in early April, we were first invited by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to come down for the signing of a bill designed to help address the fatherhood crisis plaguing our nation. Two weeks later, Governor DeSantis invited us once again to for the signing of another bill designed to combat CRT in our nation’s schools.

While separate issues, these bills were designed to protect families and ensure our nation’s children were able to accomplish whatever their dreams may be. As the governor signed the bill, he was flanked by my kids who were the ultimate benefactors of such legislation.

However, sadly widespread support was not the case with Joy Reid. If you’re not familiar with Joy Reid, she’s a political anchor on MSNBC who took it upon herself to tweet that ""The [misuse] of Black boys is tantamount to child abuse. I would really like to hear the back-story on who these kids were and how they wound up at a DeSantis event. Given how anti-Black DeSantis is, using Black children this way is extra sick."" Upon seeing the tweet, we immediately secured our kids for their own safety and privacy as calls to locate them grew amongst the media and our attention turned to Joy Reid. Being present as Gov. DeSantis signed these bills meant the world to our kids, and now they are being forced to think of their governor—the same governor that stood by them—as some racist, anti-Black person after Joy Reid’s vile comments went viral.

Joy Reid talks about the ""misuse of Black boys"" and ""anti-Blackness,"" but doesn’t seem to have that same energy when young Black boys are being misused and degraded in the school system based on CRT—a theory that has her ringing endorsement. Furthermore, for her to sit there and accuse both me and the hardworking people who work at the Jack Brewer Foundation of ""child abuse"" for kids who volunteered to be at event with the governor of their state is beyond comprehension.

However, I can’t say I’m surprised by her actions. CRT is so vile that positive things like support of two-parent households or teaching our kids that their skin color does not determine their future are rejected. Instead of teaching our nation’s youth that the color of skin should not determine how they are viewed, CRT asks that we teach our Black kids that they are victims and tell our White kids that they are oppressors. Outside the classroom, we see the same thing in corporations, our nation’s military, and even banks. For example, woke banks are now closing accounts and refusing to serve entire industries they deem not woke enough. Companies like the GEO Group and even the oil gas industry are suffering because the left’s woke agenda knows no boundaries.

The left’s woke ideology must be stopped. What began in universities has infected every facet of American life and continues to strike at our future—our children—and if we do not fight back, we will lose our country. I will hold Joy Reid accountable, and she can soon expect legal action for putting my kids in danger. But ultimately, this is about an apology that’s due. I do not want any money from MSNBC nor Joy Reid, but rather closure for my kids given this entire situation.

79,Illinois school district offers curriculum for K-3 kids to 'break the binary' of gender,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Editor's note: The following column first appeared in City Journal.

The Evanston–Skokie School District has adopted a radical gender curriculum that teaches pre-kindergarten through third-grade students to celebrate the transgender flag, break the ""gender binary"" established by white ""colonizers,"" and experiment with neo-pronouns such as ""ze,"" ""zir,"" and ""tree.""

I have obtained the full curriculum documents, which are part of the Chicago-area district’s ""LGBTQ+ Equity Week,"" which administrators adopted last year. The curriculum begins in pre-kindergarten, with a series of lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The lesson plan opens with an introduction to the rainbow flag and teaches students that ""each color in the flag has a meaning."" The teacher also presents the transgender flag and the basic concepts of gender identity, explaining that ""we call people with more than one gender or no gender, non-binary or queer.""

RACHEL LEVINE SAYS PEDIATRICIANS ALL AGREE ON IMPORTANCE OF 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR CHILDREN

Finally, the lesson plan has the teacher leading a class project to create a rainbow flag, with instructions to ""gather students on the rug,"" ""ask them to show you their flags,"" and ""proudly hang the class flag where they can all see it.""

In kindergarten, the lessons on gender and trans identity go deeper. ""When we show whether we feel like a boy or a girl or some of each, we are expressing our gender identity,"" the lesson begins. ""There are also children who feel like a girl and a boy; or like neither a boy or a girl. We can call these children transgender."" Students are expected to be able to ""explain the importance of the rainbow flag and trans flag"" and are asked to consider their own gender identity.

The kindergartners read two books that affirm transgender conversions, study photographs of boys in dresses, learn details about the transgender flag, and perform a rainbow dance. At the end of the lesson, the students are encouraged to adopt and share their own gender identities with the class.

""Now you have a chance to make a picture to show how you identify,"" the lesson reads. ""Maybe you want to have blue hair! Maybe you want to be wearing a necklace. Your identity is for you to decide!""

REPORT: TEENS EXPRESSING REGRET OVER 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' ARE 'GOING UNHEARD' BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

In first grade, students learn about gender pronouns. The teachers explain that ""some pronouns are gender neutral"" and students can adopt pronouns such as ""she, tree, they, he, her, him, them, ze, zir, [and] hir."" The students practice reading a series of scripts in which they announce their gender pronouns and practice using alternate pronouns, including ""they,"" ""tree,"" ""ze,"" and ""zir.""

The teacher encourages students to experiment and reminds them: ""Whatever pronouns you pick today, you can always change."" Students then sit down to complete a ""pronouns workbook,"" with more lessons on neo-pronouns and non-binary identities.

In third grade, Evanston–Skokie students are told that white European ""colonizers"" imposed their ""Western and Christian ideological framework"" on racial minorities and ""forced two-spirit people to conform to the gender binary.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The teacher tells students that ""many people feel like they aren’t really a boy or a girl"" and that they should ""call people by the gender they have in their heart."" Students are encouraged to ""break the binary,"" reject the system of ""whiteness,"" and study photographs of black men in dresses and a man wearing lipstick and long earrings. ""It is a myth that gender is binary,"" the lesson explains. ""Even though we are all given a sex assigned at birth, you are not given your gender. Only you can know your gender and how you feel inside.""

At the end of the lesson, students are instructed to write a letter to the future on how they can change society. ""Society right now is very unfair,"" reads a sample letter. ""I see a lot of marches on the T.V. and I even went to a march last summer.""

The curriculum in the Evanston–Skokie School District is the perfect illustration of college-level Queer Theory translated into early-elementary pedagogy. For weeks, as the nation has debated Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act, which prohibits public schools from teaching gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K–3, commentators on the political left have claimed that public schools do not teach this material and have accused conservatives of instigating a ""moral panic.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

This claim is demonstrably false, and the Evanston–Skokie lesson plans offer additional proof for parents and legislators concerned about gender ideology in American public schools.

Queer Theory has made its way into public school curriculums for children as young as four. This development should be subject to robust political debate, not denial and dismissal from the political Left.

Firefighters in Oregon rescued two people Saturday after a rollover crash in a remote area left them trapped inside their vehicle for hours, authorities said.

First responders got a call about a vehicle crash just before 5 a.m. in the rural area southwest of Timber, a community located about 40 miles northwest of Portland, Banks Fire District 13 said.

The caller said the vehicle had gone off the road and over an embankment but could not provide the exact location.

Fire officials said that minimal phone service in the remote area prevented first responders from immediately learning the exact location of the vehicle.

""Neither of the phones were able to hit more than one tower, which is necessary to give a good triangulation,"" the fire district said. ""The best location we had from the phones was what tower they were hitting, and in the coast range that can be very misleading.""

Rescuers tried to narrow down the search area using a variety of methods, including alternating sirens and listening for the caller honking a vehicle’s horn, the fire district said.

About two hours after receiving the call, fire officials said rescuers met a hiker in the area who directed them to the crash site. First responders then spotted the vehicle, which had flipped over an embankment and onto its roof.

Rob Reid, 50, of Axtell, Texas, enlisted in the Navy in 1990, serving until his retirement in October 2021.

Reid was struggling to maintain the ""very rigorous fitness standards"" of the Navy.

Reid told Fox News Digital that before he retired, he and his wife, Michelle, were inspired to improve their overall health and well-being.

At the time, Reid said his weight skyrocketed to the heaviest he'd ever been. He was dealing with high blood pressure, a respiratory condition and cholesterol issues.

In addition, Reid struggled to maintain the ""very rigorous fitness standards"" of the Navy.

Reid said he was also ""controlled by food"" at the time — and eventually reached a weight of 228 pounds.

""I knew I needed to do something,"" Reid told Fox News Digital.

‘If I saw food, I wanted to eat it'

Reid's desire to improve his health was the driving factor in his weight loss.

""My health was already declining, and my wife was in fear that her health would decline,"" said Reid.

One of the biggest changes he made, he said, was adjusting his mindset about food.

""I didn’t have any structure when it came to foods,"" Reid said, adding, ""If I saw food, I wanted to eat it.""

He said that once he joined WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers, he learned how to ""manage that craving, and it helped me manage the foods that I was consuming.""

""My health was my driving factor. My health was already declining, and my wife was in fear that her health would decline.""

It helped that there were ""no foods [that were] off-limits"" and that Reid and his wife were able to make — and achieve — small goals as they went along.

""We immediately started losing the weight,"" Reid said.

""We immediately started feeling much better,"" he also said. ""So those small goals — they transitioned to huge victories and huge successes.""

Reid said those wins gave him and his wife the ability to stay focused on their long-term goals even when things were tough.

""The mindset shifted,"" Reid said.

""And because of that mindset shift, we were able to stay within our goals.""

Cheerleaders for one another

Reid said that working on his weight loss with his wife also joining in the battle was a key part of his success.

""Having my wife join the program with me has made it significantly more executable for me,"" Reid said. ""It’s an amazing support structure.""

""We’re each other’s cheerleader,"" he added. ""[It’s been] very special with her being in the program with me.""

Together, Reid and his wife lost a combined 100 pounds.

Reid reached his target weight of 158 pounds by December of last year, just five months into their health journey.

""In my 50s, I am currently, right now, at my high school weight … [Earlier,] I was the heaviest I had ever been in my life.""

Since then, Reid has been able to keep off the weight successfully and ""comfortably,"" he said.

""I still eat the foods I enjoy,"" Reid said.

Reid said he’s also active — and that he and Michelle go on regular walks together.

""In my 50s, I am currently, right now, at my high school weight,"" Reid said.

""I would have never envisioned, at my age, that I would have been able to lose 70 pounds,"" he added.

A Florida sheriff’s office has released dramatic body camera video showing a heroic deputy climb a three-story apartment building to rescue a baby during a fire.

Orange County Sheriff’s deputies responded early Saturday morning to the Isles at East Millenia apartments in Orlando after part of the complex caught fire, the sheriff’s office said.

""It was chaos everywhere,"" Deputy William Puzynski told FOX35 Orlando. ""I started looking around you could see families trapped on each floor, hanging off the balconies.""

Puzynski and other deputies saw a mother and her baby on a third-floor balcony as flames from the ""raging"" fire entered the apartment, the sheriff’s office said.

The quick-thinking deputy took off his outer ballistic vest, which his bodycam is attached to, and began climbing up the outside balconies with some help from his fellow deputies.

84,Rob Lowe’s brother Chad Lowe on how the pair have stayed grounded in Hollywood: ‘The foundation is family’,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

For the first time in his decades-long career, Chad Lowe will appear on-screen alongside his brother, Rob Lowe.

The 54-year-old will guest star in Monday’s episode of ""9-1-1: Lone Star"" in which firefighter Capt. Owen Strand [Rob] returns to Los Angeles and is faced with ""painful childhood memories."" Robert Pine, star of ‘70s cop show ""CHiPs"" and father of actor Chris Pine, will play their dad.

Lowe previously directed two episodes of the FOX drama, which has a close connection to his family. Lowe’s nephew, John Owen Lowe, is also a writer for the series.

Lowe spoke to Fox News Digital about what compelled him to finally appear on-screen, what it was like growing up with Rob, 58, and what has kept the family grounded in Hollywood.

‘PRETTY IN PINK’ STAR ANDREW MCCARTHY ON BRAT PACK FAME, FACING ALCOHOL ABUSE: ‘IT WAS SO ALL-CONSUMING’

Fox News: You previously directed two episodes of ""9-1-1: Lone Star."" What compelled you to guest star now?

Chad Lowe: I got a phone call from the writer and one of the creators, Tim Minear. I expected the phone call was going to be about an episode I was going to direct. But he goes, ""Hey, this is not about directing. Are you interested in acting?"" I said, ""I’m always interested – yes."" And he goes, ""OK, I’ve got something for you."" I am such a fan of Tim’s work and admire him so much that I said ""yes"" before I even knew what exactly he was proposing.

Then he said, ""You’re going to play Rob’s brother."" It was great. And then I realized this is the first time Rob and I will get to be in anything together. First time we’ve ever acted together. For all of these years, many people have asked why we haven’t done it sooner, or when we are going to do it. Rob and I have both wondered ourselves why we’ve never been in anything together.

Here it is, here’s that opportunity. I was thrilled and excited about playing this character. And when I read it, I was even more thrilled. It’s a lot of dialogue… I’ve been primarily directing. So my biggest worry was, ""Am I going to remember my lines?"" You always have that fear as an actor, that you’re not going to remember your lines. It terrifies every actor. And it happens to the best of us. But for me, I was on a show that I’ve already worked on as a director.

I did not want to fail. And I especially didn’t want to fail in front of my brother. Because I would hear about it for the rest of our lives *laughs*. But it was a little bit like riding a bicycle. And it didn’t hurt that I was with my brother. Rob is just a really talented actor. He really brings the best out of me.

Fox News: What was it like to finally work alongside your brother?

Lowe: It was an incredible experience. We were able to bring our history – a lifetime of history – to these scenes and these moments that we shared on screen. There were so much unspoken [words] going on, and yet there’s the dialogue that we’re speaking. And there’s also this other life that we had, life experiences that we were able to bring. I think it’s just evident and it makes [the scenes] that much richer.

Fox News: This show is a family affair because your nephew also writes for it.

Lowe: John Owen is a writer on the show. I’ve had the pleasure of directing an episode that he wrote. So it truly was a family affair. We had Rob as the star, I was directing and John had written the episode. It was such a real thrill to have that opportunity.

Fox News: What’s it been like for you to watch your nephew find his footing in the TV and film industry?

Lowe: He’s very smart, he’s very sharp. I’ve always known that whatever he applied himself toward he would succeed because he’s really one of the smartest people I know. I often turn to John Owen for advice on anything current, be it fashion or social media skills *laughs*. He’s an expert on everything. He’s so well beyond his years… It’s not surprising to see him excel at all. I’m just an uncle, but I do have a real sense of pride watching him and all of his accomplishments.

Fox News: As a family in the film and television industry, what do you think has kept all of you grounded?

Lowe: Some might argue that we’re not grounded – we are in Hollywood after all *laughs*. But I think it’s always about family first. All the other stuff is on top of family. The foundation is family. The foundation is the love that we share for one another and each other. The most important thing is that bond. Everything else grows from that bond of family. That’s always been the most important thing to us. And I think it helps to have kids of my own. It’s very humbling and it keeps me grounded. There’s nothing more grounding than having your kids call you out.

John Owen has famously called Rob out. I enjoy watching that dynamic play out on social media as much as anybody else. As soon as Rob posts something, I can’t wait to hear what John Owen’s take on it is going to be *laughs*. I have a similar dynamic with my kids, although they’re much younger. I have three daughters and my oldest is turning 13. I have a 9-year-old and a 6-year-old. They’re my life. Literally, they’re the most important things in my life. I feel really blessed and fortunate that’s the primary focus of my life. It really does put perspective into everything that I do.

Fox News: What’s your favorite childhood memory involving your brother?

Lowe: Oh my – I have so many. I couldn’t pick just one because I literally have a lifetime full of them… We would spend our summers together in Ohio with our father. And so our father would have to work during the day. We were just these two latchkey kids in Dayton, Ohio, in the summers, kind of running amok and getting into all sorts of trouble. We were like Butch and Sundance. We were connected to the hip with everything that we did our entire childhood. We have so many shared experiences. We have songs – I can mention a song title to him and it immediately brings us back to an incident that occurred, a shared experience.

I really couldn’t just pick one because there are literally so many of them. I just said literally just like Rob [in his podcast]. I think he stole it literally from me *laughs*… We’re very competitive. We grew up very competitive with one another. We’ve had our battles like all siblings do. But he’s always been my best friend. And I think he would say the same of me. He’s the person that I turn to for almost everything in my life. Aside from my wife and my kids, it’s him.

Fox News: What do you believe has been the secret behind the success of ""9-1-1: Lone Star""?

Lowe: I think the secret sauce is just how much story it’s able to pack into a single episode that runs the gauntlet of human emotions. From the drama, the sadness, the conflict, the humor and then the action. It’s all of those ingredients in one episode. As a director, you could be directing something humorous and light-hearted, and then the very next scene, it’s incredibly emotional as it deals with life and death. And then the very next day, you’re going into this incredible location where a tragedy or rescue is happening in a building that’s on fire.

GINA TORRES JOINING ‘9-1-1: LONE STAR’ AS SERIES REGULAR

Those set pieces are always so big and dynamic. Visually, it’s incredible to look at. But it’s also about these really drawn-out characters. I’ve always said that explosions and action are great to watch, but if you don’t care about the characters, there are no stakes. What I think they’ve done so well with ""Lone Star"" is they’ve created these characters that are so diverse, come from such different backgrounds, and yet they come together and are united, usually by a single cause. You’re rooting for them and you’re invested in them. You’re invested in their well-being and the outcome of what will inevitably be a huge event. Your heart is right there with them when they’re in rescue mode.

Fox News: When do you feel most like yourself, in front of the camera or working behind it?

Lowe: I love getting the opportunity to do both, act and direct. If I can do both, it’s a perfect balance because I think each satisfies certain and different parts of who I am. I think directing is where I feel most authentic and most challenged, whereas acting feels more insular and… more vulnerable. You’re oftentimes showing parts of yourself that you don’t normally present publicly.

Fox News: What do you hope audiences will get from this episode featuring you and your brother?

Lowe: Well, it’s the first time we’ve ever been on-screen, which I’m excited to see if I watch it. I sometimes find it hard to watch myself. But I think this episode scratches deeper into the surface of what makes [Rob’s character] Owen frantic. He’s going to confront past issues that present themselves. It’s kind of an origin story. And also, it’s cathartic for him. I know Rob was really thrilled because he got to surf *laughs*. I haven’t seen the whole episode yet, but I saw some of the sequences and they’re beautiful. We get to see another side of Owen Strand, a more vulnerable side of him.

85,Johnny Depp’s daughter Lily-Rose Depp: What to know,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Lily-Rose Depp, a 22-year-old Hollywood starlet and Chanel billboard queen, has been mentioned several times while various witnesses testify in her father Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard.

Depp sued Heard — whom he was romantically linked to from 2012 until 2016 — after the actress wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post detailing alleged abuse. Although Heard didn't name Depp in the op-ed, she detailed allegations of abuse that allegedly occurred in 2016 when she was married to Depp.

During Tuesday's testimony, a story about Depp and Heard's time on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star's private island that included Lily-Rose took center stage.

Tara Roberts, the manager of Depp's private island, testified via video and recalled that she arranged for transportation to take Lily-Rose, who was around 13 years old at the time, and Heard off the island after the actor passed out drunk in the sand in front of the children. The two were accompanied by a friend of Heard's, Roberts said.

7 CRAZY CELEBRITY MOTHER-DAUGHTER LOOKALIKES

Depp is also father to a son, Jack. Jack was around 11 at the time. Roberts testified that Jack remained while Lily-Rose left.

The incident apparently occurred in the summer of 2013.

Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, asked Roberts if she remembers Lily-Rose being ""upset because her father was drinking and trying to hide it from"" her. Depp's lawyer objected, and Roberts didn't have to respond.

Prior to that, Lily-Rose was mentioned when Depp himself was testifying, saying that Lily-Rose did not attend his 2015 wedding to Heard. ""My daughter Lily-Rose did not come to the wedding. She and Ms. Heard were not on particularly great terms for several reasons,"" he testified.

So, who is Lily-Rose Depp?

Hollywood royalty

Lily-Rose is the daughter of Depp and his ex, Vanessa Paradis. The two first began dating in 1998 after meeting in Paris while Depp was filming ""The Ninth Gate.""

Depp and Paradis never got married despite spending nearly 14 years together.

""I love the romance of ‘Let’s get married,’ but then, when you have it so perfect … I mean, I’m more married than anybody can be – we have two kids. Maybe one day, but it’s something I can really do without,"" Paradis once told Elle magazine.

The pair split in 2012.

86,Pro-family group pushes back against 'pregnant man' emoji,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The American Family Association is pushing back against a recent instance of what it is calling ""corporate cultural indoctrination.""

In a statement on Monday, the AFA, based in Tupelo, Mississippi, reacted to news of Apple's iPhone emojis for IOS 15.4.

The latest emojis include one for a ""third gender"" — as well as one representing a ""pregnant man."" The ""third gender"" image shows the face of a seemingly ""neutral"" person wearing a crown.

""Companies [are] creating a stir as they promote gender confusion through their products.""

""Apple also rolled out more than 100 innocuous emojis such as new smiley faces,"" the AFA said, in part, in its media statement.

""Through this seemingly casual introduction of ‘woke’ emojis, Apple joins the ranks of corporate giants such as Disney and Netflix in the list of companies creating a stir as they promote gender confusion through their products.""

AFA’s Ed Vitagliano, executive vice president — speaking of Apple’s latest update — said that in his view, the new ""woke"" emojis foster ""even more confusion for those who might already be struggling with their identities.""

FRANKLIN GRAHAM SPEAKS OUT ABOUT DISNEY'S ‘MORAL FAILURE’

""We can all hope that the lunacy being exhibited by corporate America in its thirst for woke approval will one day be rejected,"" he said, ""by the vast majority of people in this country.""

He added, ""This woke pandering is also quite sad, as there really are people who are struggling with their identity and feel lost.""

""The answer isn’t to encourage them to continue wandering aimlessly in the darkness of their delusion, because that will only prolong their suffering,"" he said.

""The answer is the gospel and the love of God,"" said Vitagliano. ""That is the light that will help the lost find their way home and find the peace they desire.""

""The pregnant man and pregnant person recognize that ‘pregnancy is possible for some transgender men and non-binary people,’"" Emojipedia, a voting member of the Unicode Consortium, said of the move.

The American Family Association (afa.net) is a nonprofit 501c3 group; it was founded in 1977 and said it ""has long been on the front lines of America’s culture war.""

""The pregnant man and pregnant person recognize that ‘pregnancy is possible for some transgender men and non-binary people,’"" Emojipedia, a voting member of the Unicode Consortium — which approves all emojis used in smartphones — said about the move, as FOX Business previously reported.

Also, a blog post from the Emojipedia blog noted, ""As new human emojis have been released, Unicode has made an effort to be inclusive with gender, especially in recent years. The approach has varied depending on the situation, though the general goal is to standardize inconsistencies in legacy decisions.""

In a recent opinion piece about the pregnant man emoji and what it signifies, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce wrote, ""The ‘pregnant man’ does not exist. There are biological women who identify as men but still have their reproductive systems intact and, voila, are capable of getting pregnant. Recognizing that is not transphobia, and it also shouldn’t be ‘news.’ It’s a fact,"" she said.

""But,"" Bruce also said in part, ""that doesn’t get you a headline or a way to continue to try to pit Americans against each other …""

She was sharing her views, she noted in her piece, ""as a gay woman and former liberal community organizer in the 1990s.""

She also wrote, ""Men can’t get pregnant. And everyone knows it. To say otherwise is also an insult to transsexuals who continue to be used like chess pieces by partisan political operatives as their lives are objectified and sensationalized.""

""I had this idea to put it on and try it on, and it came with armed guards and gloves,"" Kardashian told Vogue's red carpet live stream host, pal LaLa Anthony. ""I tried it on, and it didn't fit me. And so I looked at them and I said, ‘Give me like three weeks.’""

88,Met Gala co-chair Anna Wintour: What to know about the Vogue editor-in-chief,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Anna Wintour is once again the Met Gala's honorary co-chair.

The Vogue editor-in-chief, 72 — whose life as an enigmatic fashion icon was recently chronicled in a new book, ""Anna: The Biography"" — has been at the decision-making helm of the magazine since 1988. She's also co-chaired the Met Gala for many years. The first time-ever was in 1995.

Known for her signature bob cut and dark sunglasses, the British-born journalist’s career has made for countless articles tracking her rise to one of the most prominent positions in the fashion editorial world since she began forging her way atop the totem pole in London back in the 1960s.

Here's what to know about Anna Wintour:

ANNA WINTOUR, HUSBAND SHELBY RYAN PRIVATELY SPLIT YEARS AGO: REPORTS

Early life

Anna Wintour’s life early on was derived from a literary background as her father, Charles Wintour, made his bones as the editor of the London ""Evening Standard,"" a position he held from 1959 to 1976.

Meanwhile, Wintour’s brother, Patrick is the diplomatic editor for The Guardian. She has credited Patrick with learning the methods of being a ""great reporter.""

ANNA WINTOUR CRITICIZES TRUMP FOR CORONAVIRUS HANDLING, REVEALS MET GALA IS POSTPONED

Wintour quickly climbed the ranks of fashion journalism after stops at New York Magazine and House and Garden before she landed the role of editor at British Vogue — which she held from 1985 to 1987 before taking over the Vogue imprint entirely.

She also had previous stints at Viva and Savvy — as well as Harper’s & Queen, where she worked as an editorial assistant. Wintour then jumped to Harper's Bazaar, where she worked as a junior fashion editor.

Successful career and a multi-million dollar net worth

These days, Wintour is estimated to be worth around $35 million.

She is also said to have the final say on anything printed in Vogue. In 1989, Wintour reshaped the future of high-fashion magazine covers when Vogue released its May issue that featured the controversial Madonna as its main draw. It was the first time that any celebrity had graced the coveted cover.

At the time, the issue would run readers just $3.00 on newsstands.

It is reported that the high fashion maven has attended more than 3,000 fashion shows in her time at Vogue.

Mind behind the Met Gala

As artistic director at its publisher Condé Nast, the most specific details of the famed Met Gala, which takes place every year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in collaboration with the museum’s Costume Institute on the first Monday in May, is decided by Wintour.

Wintour reportedly has the ultimate sign-off over the event's high-profile guest list and seating chart.

May 2's Met Gala is the second part of ""In America: An Anthology of Fashion"" — this year's sub-theme is ""Guilded Glamour.""

Mistakes made: ‘I take full responsibility’

Wintour has a reputation for being equal parts demanding and controversial, not only for her penchant to don precious furs, but also due to allegations of racial inequality within the scope of Condé Nast, which Wintour acknowledged in an open letter to her employees in June 2020.

In an emotional note to staff at the time, Wintour wrote: ""I want to start by acknowledging your feelings and expressing my empathy towards what so many of you are going through: sadness, hurt, and anger too.

ANNA WINTOUR PENS EMOTIONAL LETTER TO VOGUE STAFF PROMISING TO DO BETTER FOR ITS BLACK EMPLOYEES

""I want to say this especially to the Black members of our team — I can only imagine what these days have been like. But I also know that the hurt, and violence, and injustice we’re seeing and talking about have been around for a long time. Recognizing it and doing something about it is overdue.""

""I want to say plainly that I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators. We have made mistakes too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant. I take full responsibility for those mistakes.""

FASHION INDUSTRY ICON ANNA WINTOUR REMEMBERS THE LATE KATE SPADE

Added Wintour: ""It can’t be easy to be a Black employee at Vogue, and there are too few of you. I know that it is not enough to say we will do better, but we will — and please know that I value your voices and responses as we move forward. I am listening and would like to hear your feedback and your advice if you would like to share either.

Raanta had 35 saves in his first career postseason start with No. 1 goaltender Frederik Andersen sidelined by injury. He held up against Boston's game-opening surge to keep Carolina in it before Jarvis and Niederreiter scored roughly two minutes apart in the second period to break a scoreless tie.

Carolina never surrendered that lead. Teuvo Teravainen and Vincent Trocheck added third-period goals, which helped Carolina maintain control and then stretch out a lead in this best-of-seven series opener.

Andrei Svechnikov punctuated the win with an empty-net goal at 17:59, capping what turned into a dominating third period against a team that has twice ousted Carolina from the playoffs in recent years.

Taylor Hall scored for Boston early in the third, beating Raanta between the circles after a feed from Erik Haula from a tussle behind the net. He almost tied the game minutes later when he pinged the left post. But those were the only real mistakes for Raanta, who made the routine glove stops along with the more impressive diving saves or post-to-post slides.

The Hurricanes won the Metropolitan Division, marking the second straight season they won a division title. And they have gone from having a nine-year playoff drought to reaching the postseason for the fourth straight season, the first time that had happened since the former Hartford Whalers relocated to North Carolina in 1997.

But the first two of those runs ended against the Bruins, first in a four-game sweep in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2019 followed by a five-game loss in the first round of the Toronto bubble a year later.

This time, they’re starting with a series lead.

Linus Ullmark finished with 20 saves for the Bruins, who have lost all four matchups with Carolina this year by a combined score of 21-2.

CHECKING IN

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman was in attendance, laughing and offering a wave while hearing hearty boos while being shown on the videoboard during a second-period stoppage.

SIREN SOUNDERS

Retired Hurricanes captain Justin Williams cranked the pregame storm-warning siren for the team to take the ice, followed by Kim and Penn Holderness – a Raleigh family who recently won CBS’ ""The Amazing Race"" reality competition show – for the second period.

North Carolina men’s basketball coach Hubert Davis was the siren sounder for the third. The first-year coach led the Tar Heels to the NCAA championship game and heard plenty of cheers in the arena the Hurricanes share with UNC rival North Carolina State.

90,"Tyler Herro scores 25 points, Heat take Game 1 over 76ers","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Tyler Herro scored 25 points, Bam Adebayo finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds, and the Miami Heat topped the shorthanded Philadelphia 76ers 106-92 on Monday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.

Jimmy Butler added 15 points for the top-seeded Heat, who got 10 from Gabe Vincent and P.J. Tucker.

The 76ers were without Joel Embiid, the MVP finalist who isn’t even in Miami while recovering from an orbital fracture and concussion — injuries suffered in Philadelphia’s first-round-clinching win at Toronto. He’s not expected to play in Game 2.

And as would be expected, he was missed. Tobias Harris scored 27 points for Philadelphia, which got 19 from Tyrese Maxey and 16 points, nine rebounds and five assists from James Harden.

Game 2 is Wednesday in Miami.

Miami came out as aggressive as could be, putting Tucker on Harden and having him guard him the entire 94 feet of the floor in a similar approach to what the Heat utilized against Atlanta’s Trae Young in the first round series.

It worked — for a while. Miami led by as many as 12 in the opening quarter, then a 10-2 run fueled by eight points from Herro gave the Heat a 13-point edge at 37-24 to mark their biggest of the half. The margin was still 46-36 midway through the second after another Herro basket.

The rest of the half was all Philly.

Miami went 1 for 9 from the field over the final 6 minutes of the half, with four turnovers in there as well, and Philadelphia went on a 15-4 spurt. Harden’s shot in the lane with 28 seconds left put the 76ers up 51-50, their first lead of the night and the score that they took into the locker room.

The 76ers scored the first four points of the second half, going up by five. That was as good as it got for the 76ers.

Adebayo took a bullet pass from Tucker for a dunk that put Miami up 62-61, and that would be the final lead change of the night. It was the start of a 10-0 run that built a cushion, and then an 13-2 run early in the fourth decided matters and pushed the Heat edge out to 98-77.

TIP-INS

76ers: Philadelphia fell to 6-9 without Embiid this season. ... DeAndre Jordan started in place of Embiid and had four points and two rebounds in 17 minutes. ... Georges Niang was 0 for 7, all those shots from 3-point range.

Heat: Kyle Lowry (hamstring) missed his third consecutive game. ... Backup center Dewayne Dedmon picked up three fouls in a 23-second span of the first quarter. He then had two more in a 1:46 span of the third, giving him five fouls in 4:14 of playing time.

CLANK

The teams combined to shoot 7 for 33 in the first half from 3-point range — 3 for 17 by the 76ers, 4 for 16 by the Heat.

ROBINSON SITS

Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who led Miami in games played for a third consecutive regular season, didn’t appear in Game 1. It’s the first time since April 2019 that he dressed but didn’t play, ending a streak of 256 games including playoffs. He missed three games this season while on Miami’s inactive list.

WNBA star Brittney Griner was featured in the Phoenix Mercury’s hype video on Monday, which was released days before the 2022 season begins.

The video has voice-overs from Mercury players Skylar Diggins-Smith and Diana Taurasi as the team gets ready for another Finals run. Griner gets a prominent display at the 54-second mark.

""And times that are dark,"" Diggins-Smith says while the video pans to Griner and she and Taurasi explain why playing for the city of Phoenix matters to them.

There’s no speaking part about Griner specifically, but her detention in Russia is weighing heavily on the organization and the league as the season gets set to tip-off on Friday. The Mercury will play the Las Vegas Aces at home.

Sophie Cunningham was among those who talked about the star center being absent from the team last month.

BRITTNEY GRINER'S DETENTION WEIGHS HEAVILY ON TEAMMATES AS SEASON APPROACHES: 'WE MISS HER LIKE CRAZY'

""We’ve just got to keep praying for her,"" Cunningham said Monday. ""We hope she’s well. That’s all we know, you guys know as much as we do. No one wants to be in her situation. We miss her like crazy.""

Cunningham emphasized she was worried for Griner as a human being, not about how her absence will affect the team going forward.

""It’s BG, there’s no one like her in the whole world. We definitely miss her, but it’s not even about basketball anymore. We just want her to be well as a human being. She has a big stage, a lot of people know her, so we want her to be on the court,"" she added. ""Everyone who loves her just wants her to be home safe.""

Griner was arrested in February after Russian officials said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis.

Griner could face up to a decade in prison if she’s convicted.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Rates for well-qualified borrowers using the Credible marketplace to refinance student loans are trending up for 10-year fixed-rate loans, while 5-year variable rates are down.

For borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender during the week of Apr. 25, 2022:

Rates on 10-year fixed-rate refinance loans averaged 4.59%, up from 4.57% the week before and 3.69% a year ago. Rates for this term hit their lowest point of 2021 during the week of Nov. 22, when they were at 3.35%.

Rates on 5-year variable-rate refinance loans averaged 3.17%, down from 3.31% the week before and 3.20% a year ago. Rates for this term hit their lowest point of 2021 during the week of Nov. 22, when they were at 2.41%.

Student loan refinancing weekly rate trends

If you're curious about what kind of student loan refinance rates you may qualify for, you can use an online tool like Credible to compare options from different private lenders. Checking your rates won't affect your credit score.

Current student loan refinancing rates by FICO score

To provide relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest and payments on federal student loans have been suspended through at least Aug. 31, 2022. As long as that relief is in place, there’s little incentive to refinance federal student loans . But many borrowers with private student loans are taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to refinance their education debt at lower rates.

If you qualify to refinance your student loans, the interest rate you may be offered can depend on factors like your FICO score, the type of loan you’re seeking (fixed or variable rate) and the loan repayment term.

The chart above shows that good credit can help you get a lower rate and that rates tend to be higher on loans with fixed interest rates and longer repayment terms. Because each lender has its own method of evaluating borrowers, it’s a good idea to request rates from multiple lenders so you can compare your options. A student loan refinancing calculator can help you estimate how much you might save.

If you want to refinance with bad credit , you may need to apply with a cosigner. Or, you can work on improving your credit before applying. Many lenders will allow children to refinance parent PLUS loans in their own name after graduation.

You can use Credible to compare rates from multiple private lenders at once without affecting your credit score.

How rates for student loan refinancing are determined

The rates private lenders charge to refinance student loans depend in part on the economy and interest rate environment, but also the loan term, the type of loan (fixed- or variable-rate), the borrower's creditworthiness and the lender's operating costs and profit margin.

94,Erasing student loan debt could disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans,"President Biden has revived the possibility of erasing some student loan debt for millions of Americans, a policy that could disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans.

Biden, who is facing mounting pressure from progressives as well as declining approval ratings, floated the possibility last week of eliminating $10,000 in debt per borrower, likely through executive action.

BIDEN CANCELING STUDENT DEBT WOULD MAKE INFLATION WORSE, EXPERTS WARN

""I am considering dealing with some debt reduction,"" Biden said Thursday in response to a question at the White House. ""I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction. But I'm in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness.""

But a recent working paper published by the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute for Economics shows that erasing all student loan debt would distribute about $192 billion to the top 20% of earners in the U.S., and just $29 billion to the bottom 20% of U.S. households. That unequal distribution would likely be mirrored under a plan in which just $10,000 in debt is canceled.

Under a universal loan forgiveness program, the average individual among the top-earning borrowers would receive $5,944 in forgiveness, while those with the lowest incomes would receive $1,070 in forgiveness, according to the study, authored by economists Sylvain Catherine and Constantine Yannelis.

The pattern is similar under policies forgiving up to $10,000 in debt, with higher-income households still seeing significantly more loan forgiveness, according to the study.

""Full or partial forgiveness is regressive because high earners took larger loans, but also because, for low earners, balances greatly overstate present values,"" they argued, noting that individuals on income-driven repayment plans will already have their remaining balances forgiven after 25 years.

Instead of canceling all student loan debt, the economists said, the federal government should consider expanding income-driven repayment plans to cover more people.

""Forgiveness would benefit the top decile as much as the bottom three deciles combined,"" they said. ""Blacks and Hispanics would also benefit substantially less than balances suggest. Enrolling households who would benefit from income-driven repayment is the least expensive and most progressive policy we consider.""

Less than one-third of all student debt is held by households without a bachelor's degree — while nearly two-fifths of debt is held by households with graduate degrees. A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that most of the economic suffering from the crisis is concentrated among less-educated individuals.

Still, the Biden administration is reportedly considering income caps for eligibility for student loan relief that would exclude higher-income earners, according to the Washington Post. Officials have floated the possibility of limiting the relief to people who earned less than $125,000 or $150,000 as individual filers the previous year. That would amount to a threshold of roughly $250,000 to $300,000 for couples who file their taxes jointly.

The White House officials cautioned that no final decision has been made.

Biden supported erasing $10,000 in student debt for most borrowers during his presidential campaign, but has raised questions about his legal authority to do so via executive order. Last year, the president requested a memo from the Education Department to determine whether he had the power to unilaterally cancel student loan debt.

Such sweeping executive action would almost certainly face a legal challenge, and it's unclear whether it could survive. Critics have argued that using such power exceeds the president's authority granted by Congress. Canceling student loan debt would also add to the nation's already-ballooning national deficit, which totaled a near-record $2.8 trillion for the 2021 fiscal year.",https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/erasing-student-loan-debt-disproportionately-benefit-wealthy-americans

Borrowers with good credit seeking personal loans during the past seven days prequalified for rates that were lower for 3-year and higher for 5-year fixed rates compared to the previous seven days.

For borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender between Apr. 25 and May 1:

Rates on 3-year fixed-rate loans averaged 10.71%, down from 10.94% the seven days before and 11.48% a year ago.

Rates on 5-year fixed-rate loans averaged 13.38%, up from 13.35% the previous seven days and 12.83% a year ago.

Personal loans have become a popular way to consolidate and pay off credit card debt and other loans. They can also be used to cover unexpected expenses like medical bills , take care of a major purchase or fund home improvement projects .

Rates for 3-year fixed personal loans dipped over the past seven days, while rates for 5-year loans saw a slight increase. Rates for 3-year terms fell 0.23%, and rates for 5-year terms saw a slight increase of 0.03%. Borrowers can take advantage of interest savings with a 3-year or 5-year personal loan right now.

Whether a personal loan is right for you often depends on multiple factors, including what rate you can qualify for. Comparing multiple lenders and their rates could help ensure you get the best possible personal loan for your needs.

It's always a good idea to comparison shop on sites like Credible to understand how much you qualify for and choose the best option for you.

Here are the latest trends in personal loan interest rates from the Credible marketplace, updated monthly.

Personal loan weekly rates trends

The chart above shows average prequalified rates for borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender.

For the month of April 2022:

Rates on 3-year personal loans averaged 10.69%, up from 10.36% in March.

Rates on 5-year personal loans averaged 13.36%, up from 12.73% in March.

Rates on personal loans vary considerably by credit score and loan term. If you're curious about what kind of personal loan rates you may qualify for, you can use an online tool like Credible to compare options from different private lenders. Checking your rates won't affect your credit score.

All Credible marketplace lenders offer fixed-rate loans at competitive rates. Because lenders use different methods to evaluate borrowers, it’s a good idea to request personal loan rates from multiple lenders so you can compare your options.

Current personal loan rates by credit score

In April, the average prequalified rate selected by borrowers was:

8.42% for borrowers with credit scores of 780 or above choosing a 3-year loan

29.46% for borrowers with credit scores below 600 choosing a 5-year loan

Depending on factors such as your credit score, which type of personal loan you’re seeking and the loan repayment term, the interest rate can differ.

As shown in the chart above, a good credit score can mean a lower interest rate, and rates tend to be higher on loans with fixed interest rates and longer repayment terms.

How to get a lower interest rate

Many factors influence the interest rate a lender might offer you on a personal loan. But you can take some steps to boost your chances of getting a lower interest rate. Here are some tactics to try.

Increase credit score

Generally, people with higher credit scores qualify for lower interest rates. Steps that can help you improve your credit score over time include:

Pay bills on time. Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.

Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due. Check your credit report. Look at your credit report to ensure there are no errors on it. If you find errors, dispute them with the credit bureau.

Look at your credit report to ensure there are no errors on it. If you find errors, dispute them with the credit bureau. Lower your credit utilization ratio. Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit scoring factor.

Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit scoring factor. Avoid opening new credit accounts. Only apply for and open credit accounts you actually need. Too many hard inquiries on your credit report in a short amount of time could lower your credit score.

Choose a shorter loan term

Personal loan repayment terms can vary from one to several years. Generally, shorter terms come with lower interest rates, since the lender’s money is at risk for a shorter period of time.

If your financial situation allows, applying for a shorter term could help you score a lower interest rate. Keep in mind the shorter term doesn’t just benefit the lender — by choosing a shorter repayment term, you’ll pay less interest over the life of the loan.

Get a cosigner

You may be familiar with the concept of a cosigner if you have student loans. If your credit isn’t good enough to qualify for the best personal loan interest rates, finding a cosigner with good credit could help you secure a lower interest rate.

Just remember, if you default on the loan, your cosigner will be on the hook to repay it. And cosigning for a loan could also affect their credit score.

Compare rates from different lenders

Before applying for a personal loan, it’s a good idea to shop around and compare offers from several different lenders to get the lowest rates. Online lenders typically offer the most competitive rates – and can be quicker to disburse your loan than a brick-and-mortar establishment.

But don’t worry, comparing rates and terms doesn’t have to be a time-consuming process.

Credible makes it easy. Just enter how much you want to borrow and you’ll be able to compare multiple lenders to choose the one that makes the most sense for you.

The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

4. Check your rental for hidden spy cameras

It's happened to me. I rented a home, settled in, and realized how many cameras were watching me. It was very unsettling.

If you rent through Airbnb, cameras are allowed in public spaces and common spaces but not in bathrooms or bedrooms. They cannot be hidden and must be disclosed in the listing descriptions. VRBO forbids indoor cameras altogether, though outdoor cameras are permitted for "" reasonable monitoring .""

Larger cameras are easy to spot, but anyone can easily hide smaller cameras behind furniture, vents, or decorations. Then there are the hidden cameras that can masquerade as all kinds of things, from a Roku to an outlet extender. Seriously, you'll be shocked when you see these things .

A simple way to spot most types of cameras is to look for the lens reflection. Turn off the lights and slowly scan the room with a flashlight or laser pointer, looking for bright reflections. Scan the room from multiple spots, so you don't miss a camera pointed only at certain places. Inspect the vents, too, and any holes or gaps in the walls or ceilings.

You can also get an RF detector . This gadget can pick up wireless cameras you might not see.

If you can connect to the rental’s wireless network, a free program like Wireless Network Watcher shows what gadgets are connected. You might be able to spot connected cameras. Just be aware that the owner might have put the cameras on a second network, or they could be wired or record-only types.

If you find an indoor surveillance camera that was not disclosed to you, pick up the phone and call the police. Tell them you have direct evidence that your landlord is spying on you inside your rental home without your knowledge or permission. Use this exact phrase.

Document the situation with video and photos on your smartphone. Once you have your police report, contact the rental site.

5. Find the comfiest seat

If you're tall, you know how important a few extra inches of legroom are on a flight. It can be the difference between being comfy or cramped for hours.

Google Flights is a great way to find the cheapest flight, but you take an extra step to find the most comfortable seat.

Get the Chrome browser extension called Legroom for Google Flights . When using Google Flights, you'll also see how much legroom per seat per flight you selected.

98,3 ways Incognito mode can save you,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

We willingly give our most personal data so often to advertisers, Big Tech, scammers, and everyone else looking to make a dime off us. Want to take control back? Start with changing a few settings that make it easier for strangers and companies to pinpoint who you are in your Chrome browser .

While you’re at it, take a minute and look at your Facebook account settings. Tap or click for three steps to limit or stop targeted ads .

Your browser offers Incognito or private mode. It’s not a privacy catch-all, but it can make a real difference.

Is Incognito mode private? Sort of …

While Incognito mode in any browser does provide more privacy than if you’re not using it, incognito isn’t as private as we were led to believe.

When you surf the web incognito, your browser doesn't save your browsing history, cookies, site data or information you enter in forms. However, it keeps any downloaded files or bookmarks created during the session.

Your internet service provider can still see your activity, as can a school or employer providing your internet access or computer. Want to stop that? You need a VPN .

That leads us to the question, ""Is Incognito mode even worth using?""

Yes, let’s look at three situations.

1. Trying to keep gifts a surprise

When you shop online, your browser keeps tabs on what you’ve perused. Later, you’ll see ads pop up on other sites that try to get you to come back to make the purchase — even if you’ve already bought the item.

You might not be the only person seeing those ads. If the person you're buying the gift for uses your computer, tablet, or smartphone, they will see the same ads. They may see them on their own devices, too, since you share an IP address.

Of course, these ads tip them to what you’re up to. That won’t happen if you shop in Incognito mode.

Stop throwing money down the drain: 5 ways you're ruining your expensive phone, laptop, tablet, and TV.

2. Stopping the algorithm’s watchful eye

We all look up things we don't want to follow us around the web for years. Maybe you're worried about an illness, or you need to look up a tutorial on doing a task around the house.

It’s annoying to see reminders of those searches everywhere, especially in your YouTube algorithm. You can avoid these suggestions by searching in Incognito mode.

You’ll notice that I said YouTube. Yes, Incognito mode isn’t just for your browser. You can search YouTube Incognito, too — but only from your phone. Here’s how:

Open the YouTube app .

. Tap your profile picture in the top right of the screen, then tap Turn on Incognito.

This feature only works when you're signed in. When browsing incognito, your watch history, searches, and other activity won’t be saved to your profile.

Did you know there are hidden apps on your phone? No, I don’t mean creepy spyware. These are useful, handy little features you should know .

3. Separating your work and home life

Most of us have two versions of our online selves: Work and personal.

It's a pain when you want to check your personal inbox, but you're logged into your work account — especially if you use the same provider for both. Instead of using different browsers or signing in and out of your accounts, use Incognito mode.

Try signing into your work email using your browser like usual, then open an incognito window for your personal account. Easy.

PRO TIP: You can go even further by setting up separate browser profiles for work and life. You can bookmark, change your settings, or install extensions to make each profile more useful.

Tap or click here to do that in your favorite browser . We cover Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Sorry, Safari users, but Apple doesn’t offer this option.

101,"Ahead of Mother's Day, Florida rabbi reveals gratitude for 'tenacity' and 'faith' of his mom","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

With Mother's Day 2022 coming up shortly, many have already turned their focus and thoughts toward the moms, stepmoms, aunts, grandmothers and others who have made a tremendous difference in their lives — and helped them become the people they are today.

One rabbi in Florida shared the impact his own mother has had on his life.

""My mom and her family always taught me the value of faith and a love for America,"" said Rabbi Pinchas Taylor of Plantation, Florida.

""We didn't have much money growing up, but my mom would regularly sacrifice her own comforts and even needs.""

He said that his mom, Linda, ""taught me that if you want something, you need to fight for it. Never give up. I've tried to live with this tenacity my whole life,"" he told Fox News Digital.

He said that when he was growing up, ""she always went out of her way to have fun with us … She encouraged my brother and me in the things we were interested in.""

‘SPIRITUAL MOTHERS’ SHARE WISDOM, STRENGTH FOREVER

The rabbi, who today is married and has seven children of his own, said, ""We didn't have much money growing up, but my mom would regularly sacrifice her own comforts and even needs to make sure we would have new clothes for school, birthday parties or a chance to go at least a few weeks to summer camp.""

""Looking back now, with an adult's perspective,"" he added, ""I can see the efforts were nothing short of heroic.""

MOTHER'S DAY GIFT IDEAS FOR 2022

It said that for him, ""It's a pleasure to relive my mom's interaction with her own kids as I watch her now interact with her grandkids.""

Mothers are ""central to Jewish life"" and play a tremendous role in the biblical narrative.

He also recounted ""a fond and funny memory"" that happened on a recurring basis throughout his childhood.

Said Taylor, ""She had a tremendous fear of cockroaches. If there was one in the house, she would scream and empty an entire container of Raid trying to spray it while it ran through the house.""

‘Central’ figures

Mothers are ""central to Jewish life"" and play a tremendous role in the biblical narrative, Rabbi Taylor shared with Fox News Digital.

""The first woman in the Bible was Eve, whose Hebrew name (Chava) translates as the ‘mother of all living things,’"" said Taylor.

""Adam, the first man in the Bible, has no parental quality in the Hebrew etymology of his name. The maternal role is of paramount importance to humanity,"" he added.

""Of the many things I’ve learned from my own mother, having a simple and sincere faith ranks highest on the list.""

""Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah — the four matriarchs — are revered and commemorated by the four cups of wine at the Passover seder,"" added Taylor.

""Jewish scriptural tradition emphasizes that the heroic mothers in Egypt risked their lives and defied Pharaoh’s order to drown the Israelite boys in the Nile, and that it was the women and mothers who faithfully anticipated redemption from slavery.""

""King Solomon described all Jewish living experience as being from our mothers (Proverbs 1:8).""

Said Taylor, ""It is she who teaches that there is a flavor, a scent, a warmth to fulfilling the commandments. Of the many things I’ve learned from my own mother, having a simple and sincere faith ranks highest on the list.""

ALVEDA KING SHARES IMPORTANCE OF FOOD, FAMILY ON MOTHER'S DAY

""The mother gives of her essence, nurturing the embryo in her womb — and Jewish law decisively states that being born a Jew is passed on exclusively through the mother,"" he said.

He also noted that the ""Hebrew word for faith (emunah) is based on the word for mother (em).""

Taylor added, ""This root word is at the heart of many Hebrew words referring to deeply internalized knowledge and values that shape us at our core.""

""Mother’s Day is an excellent opportunity to reawaken our gratitude to our mothers, which we should have year-round.""

""[So] when we seek faith, we are in a sense searching for an inner mother, something to nurture us, particularly during hard times.""

MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS, WALKED THE PATH OF ALL STRUGGLING MOTHERS TODAY

This is why, he also said, ""Mother’s Day is an excellent opportunity to reawaken our gratitude to our mothers, which we should have year-round, and perhaps an opportunity to rejuvenate our connection with God and our faith as well.""

Chase Elliott won the Duramax Drydene 400 NASCAR Cup Series race at Dover on Monday, 24 hours after it began.

The race had been postponed after 78 laps due to rain on Sunday and resumed at Noon Monday under sunny skies.

Points-leader Elliott was in second place for the restart behind teammate Kyle Larson and becomes the last of the four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to win a race in the 2022 season.

Ricky Stenhouse Jr. finished a comfortable second ahead of Ross Chastain who made contact with Martin Truex Jr. on the final lap, causing the Joe Gibbs Racing driver to skid out of contention and eventually finish 12th. Christopher Bell and Alex Bowman rounded out the top five.

The win was Elliot's first since last year's road course race at Road America and his first oval track win in 46 tries. Speaking of his crew after the race, Elliott said, ""those guys have been deserving of one for a while, so I'm glad we could get across the line first.""

104,Legendary NASCAR 'con man' L.W. Wright reveals himself after 40 years in hiding,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

He’s one of the most famous NASCAR drivers of all time, even though he only completed 13 laps in his career.

L.W. Wright was an unknown racer who entered and qualified for the 1982 Winston 500 at Talladega in 36th place. No one on the NASCAR circuit had heard of him before, despite claims, which turned out to be false, that he’d made several prior starts in the Cup Series.

Hailing from Nashville, Wright had obtained his car from the shop of Sterling Marlin, who also provided a pit crew for the event. He was black-flagged 13 laps into the race for being too slow, however, and then his story turned into a legend.

Wright allegedly abandoned the car at the track and disappeared, leaving a string of bounced checks in his wake. B.W. Terrell, a team owner who had reportedly assisted in getting him the car, told the press at the time that Wright owed him over $30,000 for the transaction and other help.

Wright’s whereabouts have been unknown in the years since, but on Monday, May 2, which marks the 40th anniversary of the race, the NASCAR-focused ""The Scene Vault Podcast"" released an episode featuring an interview with a man who says he is him.

Podcast host and motorsports journalist Rick Houston told Fox News Autos that he’d been trying to track down Wright for over a year through someone who knew him and in April received a call saying he was ready to talk.

Houston describes how he wasn’t given an address, but was instructed to drive to a location on a highway where he would meet up with someone who would lead him to Wright.

Wright told Houston his real name is Larry Wright and showed him the racing suit he wore at Talladega as proof. There’s only one published photo of Wright from the race, and Houston said both he and the suit are a perfect match.

Houston has only released a portion of the interview, as he is saving most of it for future projects, but Wright tells a somewhat different story in the clips than what has been reported before.

He said he was a bus driver working in the music industry in Nashville and received money from music stars Waylon Jennings, George Jones and Merle Haggard, all since deceased, to help pay for his Talladega entry.

As he explains, he told Marlin he’d pay him for the car after the race, but didn’t. He also never paid bills for tires from Goodyear and his NASCAR competition license. A representative for Marlin has not yet responded to a request for comment on the story from Fox News Autos.

Records show that Wright actually attempted to qualify for the next race at the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway the following week. He chalks up his unpaid bills to a sponsor who backed out after he failed to qualify for the event, but denies he ever owed Terrell $30,000.

""If you can find somebody that said that I owe them $30,000, you tell them I’ll face them,"" Wright said.

Terrell passed away in 1998 and his son, Bernie, told Fox News Autos that he remembers hearing the stories about his father loaning Wright the money and a truck, but that he’s not sure how accurate they are. He said his father never really talked about it with him and that it didn’t seem like a big deal that weighed on him.

Houston said Wright’s personal history is still a little cloudy, but that he’s confident what he told him about the events surrounding Talladega are mostly accurate. Wright admits never having been in a Cup Series race before it, but Houston said he had competed in small-time stock car racing.

Among a few details Wright shared were his first impression of the track, which he’d never seen before arriving for the race weekend.

""I looked over at my brother and I said, ‘Lord, have mercy. Ain’t no way,’"" he told Houston. ""Lord, I’m down here, but I’m gonna need some help.""

Wright’s car wore the number 34, which he said was both his age and a tribute to Black NASCAR pioneer Wendell Scott, who, like him, raced without a lot of means. He claims that Dale Earnhardt told him, ""When you get out there, you get on the back of someone who’s been here before and follow them. Stay with them, and then make your move.""

Fox Sports NASCAR analyst Larry McReynolds, who was at the race as part of Donnie Allison's team and worked with Earnhardt a few years later, doesn't have direct knowledge of Wright's claims, but said Earnhardt was the type of driver who often offered advice to rookies.

Wright crashed on his second qualifying lap, but the car was repaired for the race. The daunting 2.66-mile oval proved too much of a challenge, however, and officials decided to get him off the track for safety.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Journalist Steve Wade, who was at the event, said they didn’t think much about it at the time because then it was easier to enter a NASCAR race and there were always a couple of local drivers who tried to race at Talladega.

According to Houston, Wright is in poor health and wanted to get his side of the story out there while he still can.

Houston said he is working on a book and entertaining offers for other ways to share more of Wright’s story.",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/nascar-con-man-l-w-wright

The NASCAR Cup Series race at Dover International Speedway was postponed for rain after just 78 laps of a scheduled 400 were completed on Sunday, with the restart moved to Monday.

Kyle Larson was leading the Duramax Drydene 400 when race was red-flagged, followed by his teammate Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney and Martin Truex Jr.

The delay gives Truex the unique opportunity to win at Dover for third time after it was postponed for inclement weather, having previously done so in 2007 and 2019.

Pole-sitter Chris Buescher will also be hoping for history to repeat itself, as his only Cup Series win came at Pocono in 2016 when the race was called early for fog having already been pushed to Monday due to rain.

106,Texas man charged with murder after fatal shooting of girlfriend's daughter,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A Texas man was charged with murder Friday after he allegedly shot and killed his girlfriend's 16-year-old daughter, according to officials.

The teenage girl, identified by family as Lauren Juma, was pronounced dead after having been shot multiple times.

Van Brisbon, 60, was charged with murder and has been booked into the Harris County jail, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez wrote in a tweet Friday morning. Brisbon did not cooperate with investigators, Gonzalez said. The motive of the gunman is not known at the time.

Harris County deputies arrived at the scene at about 1 a.m. Friday morning after they were notified by Juma's sister that their mother's boyfriend had the 16-year-old held captive inside his home.

""It was 1 o'clock in the morning, and she just said he was being really weird and she wanted me to come pick her up,"" Lauren's 19-year-old sister, Keryca Harmon, told KTRK-TV. ""That's what I did.""

Harmon was standing outside the home when the incident occurred and said authorities were already there when she arrived.

""By the time I got there, the police were already out there searching around the house,"" she said. ""I was there about three minutes before I heard two gunshots go off, and I ran toward the house.""

Upon arrival, authorities reported they had heard a gunshot and screaming followed by a subsequent gunshot, according to FOX 26.

Brisbon then came out of the house and was arrested, the sheriff's office said, according to Gonzalez. Deputies discovered the victim's corpse inside the house.

The man told deputies at the time of his arrest, ""You do what you have to do,"" KTRK reported.

107,Hawaii’s stray cats pose major threat to protected species: Why visitors should be cautious,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Plenty of cats may look cute and cuddly, but the strays in Hawaii are doing more damage there than many people realize, according to experts.

And for all those planning a visit to The Aloha State this year — whether in the week ahead (National Travel and Tourism Week is May 1-7, 2022) or later in 2022 — this information is useful.

The majority of wild and feral cats throughout the Hawaiian Islands tend to hunt certain protected species of wildlife; plus, they spread disease.

HAWAII'S THREATENED SPECIES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT PROTECTED WILDLIFE ON THE ISLANDS

Experts at Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) are cautioning visitors against interacting with the cats. The aquatic division’s Ryan Jenkinson, PhD, shared in an interview with Fox News Digital exactly how the cats are harming Hawaiian wildlife.

""They are incredibly destructive animals to the native species in Hawaii,"" he said.

next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Since Hawaii’s species evolved without the threat of predators, a lot of the animals — Hawaiian monk seals included — are not equipped with defense mechanisms to ward off predatory cats.

Cats don’t hunt or harass monk seals, but they’re still a primary suspect in seal mortality, due to toxoplasmosis. This disease is transmitted through oocytes found in feline feces, which wash down into the streams and eventually the ocean, Jenkinson noted.

""Cats are amazing predators of wildlife,"" said Josh Atwood of the forestry division.

""The parasite, for some reason, really reacts strongly with marine mammals,"" he said. ""It has a disproportionate effect on monk seals … The worst part about it is, it seems to target females, especially pregnant females.""

It might be difficult to ignore large groups of adorable-looking cats when visiting Hawaii, but the two experts agreed that feeding and nurturing the cats will only worsen the issue and further the spread of disease.

""It’s so hard because you don’t realize that by giving them food, letting them continue to reproduce — they’re having this huge impact on our native species here,"" Jenkinson said.

""It is a really hard subject because people really love their cats.""

""Cats in sanctuaries … go visit them, pet them,"" Atwood said.

""Just a suggestion for people visiting: Don’t feed the cats,"" he added. ""If you want to take them home with you — awesome.""

For visitors who would like to be affectionate in a ""safe space"" with Hawaii’s cats, Lanai Cat Sanctuary allows tourists to interact with cats in a protected enclosure.

The private, non-profit organization, recommended by Atwood, is located on the island of Lanai and makes an effort to separate the cats from the outdoor areas inhabited by native species.

There’s a wild bear in North Carolina who seemingly knows how to look both ways before crossing a street.

A video of the traffic savvy bear was shared to Facebook by the Asheville Police Department.

The bear had been walking through the downtown area on Thursday, April 21, before police were called.

""The black bear, wearing a Wildlife enforcement tracking collar, seemed to want a day in the park, where lots of people were enjoying their day downtown,"" the police department wrote in the post.

At one point, the bear cautiously looked side-to-side before it entered the crosswalk and passes by retail space, the video shows.

The Asheville Police Department noted that while it appreciated the bear’s ""law-abiding"" nature ""it was important to get the bear back to a wooded area for safety.""

Eventually, the bear climbed a tree in the Pritchard Park area while onlookers watched from a distance.

""Officers wanted to help get the bear safely out of the area by helping give the bear space to mosey along,"" the Asheville Police Department continued.

In an animal profile, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission reports that ""black bears have made a remarkable recovery in population and range"" thanks to ""science-based management and bear sanctuaries.""

The agency last reported a population estimate of approximately 17,000 black bears in the state of North Carolina back in 2012.

Resources from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission also say humans and black bears are crossing paths more often as people continue to move to the state, which has resulted in broadened residential zones that encroach bear ranges.

To keep homes free of bears, the wildlife agency advises people to not feed bears and remove all potential food sources, including open garbage or compost cans, pet food, bird feeders and used grills (cleaning is recommended).

If a person does come into contact with a bear, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission says people should keep their distance, alert neighbors and keep crowds to a minimum.

110,Does 'hair of the dog' actually work after drinking alcohol? What experts say about the hangover 'cure',"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

There's a belief that drinking more alcohol when you’re already hungover can cure you of some rough symptoms.

The tactic seemingly stems from the medieval theory that the source of an ailment could also be the remedy for it.

IF YOU'RE DRINKING MORE ALCOHOL, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

This thought eventually led to the expression ""the hair of the dog that bit you,"" which resulted in the development of fur-filled tonics from suspected rabid dogs in hopes of preventing rabies infections in humans, according to Lexico, an online dictionary powered by the Oxford University Press.

While the questionable tonics didn’t work and fell out of favor with the rise of modern medicine, the ""hair of the dog"" expression has stuck around, and it has even become associated with drinking.

Unlike its predecessor, though, there might be a little truth to treating alcohol-induced hangovers with alcohol, but experts still don't recommend it. Here’s why.

Does 'hair of the dog' work?

""The short answer is yes,"" said Dr. Ken Perry, an emergency physician in South Carolina.

""The feeling of a hangover is due to the receptors being without alcohol,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Many of the symptoms [including headache and gastrointestinal upset] are minimized if the alcohol is reintroduced and the receptors are no longer absent of alcohol.""

""In a way, the ‘hair of the dog’ does actually work in the short term,"" Perry continued. ""That being said, it doesn’t fix a hangover, but rather delays the symptoms.""

The NIAAA’s input on ‘hair of the dog’

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) addressed the hair of the dog theory in an online brochure.

DOES 'DRY JANUARY' ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH?

The government agency’s brochure states that drinking alcohol while hungover ""might temporarily minimize some symptoms"" — but ""it could contribute to and prolong the malaise and other symptoms of the hangover.""

If you’re trying to find an actual hangover cure, you’re sadly out of luck, according to the NIAAA, which is a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

TANQUERAY IS LAUNCHING ALCOHOL-FREE GIN

""The only way to completely avoid a hangover is to not drink alcohol at all or to keep alcohol intake to a minimum,"" the NIAAA’s brochure said.

""There is no cure for a hangover other than time.""

Are there better options than ‘hair of the dog'?

A 2017 news release from the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina, which was published in Science Daily, said the hair of the dog theory for alcohol consumption has no scientific evidence to back it up.

""It will, at best, postpone"" a hangover, said Laura Veach, who’s a doctoral degree holder in substance counseling, in a statement.

""Taking a drink the morning after may temporarily make you feel better because you're putting alcohol back into the system,"" she said.

""But it doesn't cure the hangover; it just sort of tricks you by masking the symptoms. They're going to show up eventually.""

Hangover symptoms reportedly occur when blood alcohol content drops to zero; symptoms can include undesirable results such as headache, thirst, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and poor mood, according to the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

111,Minnesota woman drops 117 pounds after losing her job amid COVID: 'A healing journey',"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

After hitting a low point in her life amid the COVID pandemic, a Minnesota woman vowed to improve her health and her lifestyle — eventually leading her to lose roughly half her body weight.

Like so many other Americans, Katie Schmitt, 43, of Rochester, was laid off from her job in June 2020, during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic.

She had worked, at that point, at the same nonprofit for 10 years, she said.

Schmitt was about 100 pounds overweight, had high blood pressure and had low energy, she said.

""I was thrown into a different life during the pandemic,"" Schmitt told Fox News Digital during an interview. ""It was a really dark time, I think for a lot of people, and I definitely felt that.""

FORMER ‘JEOPARDY!’ WINNER SHEDS 200 POUNDS: ‘I WAS ABLE TO STICK WITH IT’

That’s when Schmitt began evaluating her goals for the future.

""As I was doing that, I recognized that my weight would hold me back,"" Schmitt said.

At the time, Schmitt said she was about 100 pounds overweight and had high blood pressure and had low energy. She also struggled with depression after losing family members, she said.

""I was just feeling awful,"" Schmitt said.

‘Building self-care habits and skills’

So after doing research into various programs and methods of weight loss, Schmitt said she landed on WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers), joining in November 2020. At the time, she weighed 240 pounds.

Schmitt had tried weight loss strategies before that but would often quit after less than a month. This time, she made a plan and stuck to it.

""I said, ‘I’m going to follow this beyond those three weeks and at that three-week period, I’m going to be on target with myself,’"" Schmitt said, adding that she checked in with herself on an hourly basis.

""I was thrown into a different life during the pandemic.""

""I would ask myself, ‘Am I really hungry? Is this a real hunger or if I have a cup of tea, is that going to be a better option for me right now?’ Or maybe I’m just feeling a little anxious and I need to take a walk,"" Schmitt said.

In those moments when she thought eating would make her feel better, she looked for other options.

""It was really about building those self-care habits and skills,"" Schmitt said. ""I had a list of options printed out, [showing] what else I [could] do besides eat.""

Schmitt's secret was to make her journey more about healing than weight loss.

COUPLE WHO LOST A COMBINED 146 POUNDS GOES VIRAL ON TIKTOK: ‘LIFE-CHANGING’

She first focused on her sleeping and eating habits. She made it a point to not look at the number on the scale, either.

""I know that sounds crazy, but that’s really what happened for me,"" she said.

Eventually, Schmitt eased into activity by adding 10-minute walks to her daily routine.

""My knees hurt, my hips hurt, my body was sore from carrying that extra weight and so it was really important for me to start moving. But I knew I couldn’t just go from zero to 100 miles per hour,"" Schmitt said.

‘Rewarded with better energy’

Schmitt began focusing on what she was bringing into her life — including getting more sunshine and reading poetry — rather than what she was restricting or removing.

""I was creating in my art studio. I was finding ways essentially to pass the time while I was on this journey so that it felt better, it felt beautiful,"" she added. ""That was really important to me, to create something that was beautiful and not just about exercise and food.""

WOMAN LOSES 130 POUNDS BY ‘HABIT-STACKING’: ‘FOCUS ON PROGRESS, NOT PERFECTION’

Schmitt challenged the common idea — something she'd heard all her life — that weight loss is ""hard."" Instead, she wrote lists in her journal about positive habits and self-care.

""I believed it,"" Schmitt said about the notion that losing weight is difficult. ""I thought, ‘Well, then, it’s not for me. I can’t do it because it’s hard.’""

""Do I feel healthy? Do I have the energy?""

""I said, ‘How do I make this easier for myself?’""

As she lost weight, Schmitt said she was motivated to keep going because of how she felt. ""I was getting rewarded with better energy [and] feeling better,"" Schmitt said.

Though the coronavirus pandemic was challenging for Schmitt, she said that losing weight was actually a way to ""control something in my life.""

""That health and wellness piece was something that I could latch onto, to get me through some of those things that were way out of our control during that time,"" Schmitt said of the pandemic.

One of the challenges for Schmitt, while she worked on losing weight during the pandemic, was the isolation from her friends and family — but having the support of her husband was essential.

""I would ask people questions, people who were on the same weight loss journey … They were the people who had done it.""

""My spouse was really important,"" Schmitt said. ""He was on board in terms of helping prep food, he would eat the food that I cooked … We were in it together, in those terms.""

Schmitt said she also relied on the social media function of the WW app; she followed and talked to people who had overcome some of the same challenges she was trying to overcome.

""That, for me, was everything,"" Schmitt said. ""I would ask people questions, people who were on the same weight loss journey … They were the people who had done it.""

‘It feels really good’

Schmitt said her initial goal was to lose 100 pounds.

Once she hit her original goal weight of 140, Schmitt decided to lose another five pounds to see how she felt.

When she did, Schmitt said she asked herself: ""How does this feel on my body? Do I feel like it’s hard to maintain? Do I feel healthy? Do I have the energy?""

""It’s much easier than I thought it would be at this point.""

After that, Schmitt lost another five pounds and asked herself the same questions.

She did that again for a third time before settling on her current weight.

Today, Schmitt weighs about 123 pounds — so she's down 117 pounds from her starting weight back in November 2020.

Schmitt said she’s been able to maintain her weight of between 123 and 125 pounds for the last three months.

""It’s much easier than I thought it would be at this point,"" Schmitt said.

""It feels really good,"" she added. ""I’m at a healthy BMI [body mass index], my blood pressure is down [and] my doctor is super happy.""

‘Time is going to pass either way’

Schmitt has advice for those seeking a lifestyle change.

MINNESOTA COUPLE LOSES MORE THAN 200 POUNDS COMBINED

Be ""gentle with yourself,"" she said. ""You can’t hate yourself thin,"" she said, adding later, ""Let your body set the pace.""

""You get to re-imagine what weight loss looks like.""

""I remember thinking, ‘I’m in this big hole, I need to find a way to dig out and I want it done tomorrow. I don’t want to live like this anymore,’"" Schmitt said.

""The reality was, time is going to pass either way,"" she continued. ""And I have a choice during this time to get healthy, or I can continue to eat poorly and not exercise and not feel good.""

Schmitt also suggested thinking of weight loss as a lifestyle — rather than as a short-term solution or program to follow.

""It had to be more than just getting back from her baby weight, but how do I keep whatever I am doing now forever. That's why we are not a big fan of doing any extreme diet or radical forms of exercise,"" he added.

Pasternak worked with Simpson's doctor to create a sustainable meal plan of lean protein and vegetables. She eats three meals a day and has two snacks like ""parmesan green beans and a handful of almonds.""

Simpson's workout plan included walking 14,000 steps a day and full-body workouts.

Simpson also spoke about becoming sober in a recent interview with Entrepreneur. She shared that her subconscious played a major role in both her personal and professional life.

""When I stopped drinking, it was because I had stopped hearing the voice I really trusted, and I was lost without her,"" Simpson told the outlet.

114,Long nails may not be as hygienic as you think: report,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Long nails may make a fashion statement, but there are microorganisms lurking underneath that can cause potential infections, according to a recent USA Today report.

""The longer the nail, the more surface area there is for microorganisms to adhere,"" said Jeffrey Kaplan, a biology professor at American University.

""Studies have found 32 different bacteria and 28 different fungi underneath fingernails.""

And whether they’re artificial nails, long natural nails, gel nails, acrylic nails or just nail polish, they increase the probability that microorganisms lurk underneath them, which in turn makes it more difficult to wash off with simple handwashing, Kaplan added.

He noted one study that found that a resistant bacteria, known as methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, or MRSA, in half of fingernail samples, which could subsequently lead to an infection.

""You can transmit fingernail bacteria to your system by scratching, nail-biting, nose-picking and finger-sucking,"" Kaplan said.

The bacteria and fungi underneath the long nails can also lead to a nail infection, which could leave the fingernails disfigured.

WOMAN WITH THE LONGEST FINGERNAILS CUTS THEM FOR FIRST TIME SINCE THE 90S

In 1997-98, after an Oklahoma City hospital investigated an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacteria acquired often in the hospital setting, epidemiologists discovered a link between approximately half the 16 infants who died in the neonatal unit and the bacteria under long fingernails, according to the New York Times.

The hospital subsequently imposed measures that prohibited long nails in the neonatal intensive care unit.

""A growing body of evidence suggests that wearing artificial nails may contribute to transmission of certain healthcare associated pathogens. Healthcare workers who wear artificial nails are more likely to harbor gram-negative pathogens [like Pseudomonas] on their fingertips than are those who have natural nails, both before and after handwashing,"" according to the Centers for Disease and Prevention.

So the agency recommends that artificial nails should not be worn by health care workers who have direct patient care with high risk patients, like in the intensive care unit, and their nail tips be kept to one-fourth inch in length.

""Long nails are a perfect hideout for pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, that get trapped under there,"" said Dr Cristina Psomadakis, a dermatologist based in the U.K. and popular on Instagram as ""Dr. Soma.""

MAN NEARLY DIES FROM SEPSIS INFECTION CAUSED BY BITING HIS FINGERNAILS

""I also recommend clear polish or translucent finishes on nails. This allows us to be able to see when our nails are dirty and serves as a visual reminder to wash our hands.""

But nail technician Kayla Newman, who is based in North Carolina, said none of her clients had any infections in her eight years of practice.

""Generally people who have long nails know how to maneuver with them and keep them clean,"" she said.

""If you're spending upwards of $60 to get your nails done and you don't keep them clean, that doesn't make sense.""

She recommends for those with long nails to make regular appointments because the nail strength may shift as they grow with broken nails as the most common complaint – especially those new to them.

118,Medical company creates most accurate 3D model of female anatomy ever,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Elsevier has launched ""the most advanced 3-D full female model ever available,"" according to a recent press release.

""This is the first time that a female model has been built with this level of detail in its entirety, to represent the female — versus replacing specific areas of the male anatomy with female features,"" the Elsevier release stated. The company, which is a known leader in publishing research and information analytics, said in the release that this model would help educators for the first time teach, visualize, and edit anatomy entirely from the female perspective using a realistic detailed 3-D model.

Historically, the female anatomy has been underrepresented in the study of the human body and the company said this is a major milestone in equal representation in helping prepare nursing, allied health and medical students with a complete understanding of the female anatomy, the release said.

Elsevier says its 3D female model includes the following clear differences from male anatomy models:

The skeletal system will accommodate changes to reflect the boney angles typically seen in the female and will demonstrate differences in areas that differ from males including in the pelvis and skull

""As an advocate for content that is diverse and inclusive, we are thrilled to offer this groundbreaking full female model to allow educators to teach anatomy in an equal and comprehensive way. Complete Anatomy is continuing Elsevier’s rich heritage of innovation in education by delivering on our vision of providing transformative medical education solutions,"" Elizabeth Munn, Managing Director, Global Medical Education, Elsevier, said in the release.

Lead subject-matter expert on the update, Yasmin Carter, PhD, Assistant Professor of Translational Anatomy at the UMass Chan Medical School, in Worcester, MA, said in the release, ""One of the inherent dangers in using only the male body as ‘anatomical normal’ and the female body as a variation is perpetuating sexist attitudes. This unconscious bias will be carried by learners into their future interactions with the body, including potentially with patients.""

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday scheduled public meeting to review COVID-19 vaccines for the youngest children in the U.S.

The meetings are slated for June 8, 21 and 22, but the dates are not final.

FDA RELEASES PLAN TO BEN MENTHOL IN CIGARETTES, CIGARS

A panel of experts will review applications from vaccine-makers Moderna and Pfizer for child vaccines.

""As we continue to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are a number of anticipated submissions and scientific questions that will benefit from discussion with our advisory committee members,"" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. ""We are providing a tentative schedule for discussion of these submissions, as these meetings will cover a number of topics that are of great interest to the general public. The agency is committed to a thorough and transparent process that considers the input of our independent advisors and provides insight into our review of the COVID-19 vaccines. We intend to move quickly with any authorizations that are appropriate once our work is completed.""

The agency said more details will be provided as each company completes its application.

""There will be no delays,"" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Friday. ""We’ll review the data, hold an advisory committee meeting and make a decision as quickly as possible once we get the applications.""

On Thursday, Moderna asked the FDA to authorize its vaccine for emergency use in children under 6 years of age.

FDA MOVES TO LIMIT LEAD CONTENT IN JUICES

The biotech company said the shot was about 51% effective against the virus for kids under 2 years old and about 37% effective in kids ages 2 to 5.

It added that similar requests are underway with international regulatory authorities, noting that the requests are based on a 25-microgram two-dose primary series of the vaccine.

""We are proud to share that we have initiated our EUA submission for authorization for our COVID-19 vaccine for young children,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. ""We believe mRNA-1273 will be able to safely protect these children against SARS-CoV-2, which is so important in our continued fight against COVID-19 and will be especially welcomed by parents and caregivers.""

Modern has filed FDA applications for older kids, but the FDA has not ruled on them and it remains unclear if that data will be under consideration.

120,"WHO, UNICEF warn about ‘perfect storm’ for measles in children","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) are warning communities about what they say is a ""perfect storm"" of conditions for measles outbreaks in children.

The agencies said that reported worldwide measles cases increased by 79% in the first two months of 2022, compared to the same time period last year.

WISCONSIN REPORTS FIRST DEATH IN US POSSIBLY LINKED TO PUZZLING HEPATITIS OUTBREAK IN CHILDREN

Almost 17,338 measles cases were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared with 9,665 during the first two months of 2021.

Countries with the largest outbreaks include Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Ethiopia.

There have been 21 large and disruptive outbreaks in the last 12 months, from April 2021 through April 2022, with most reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. That number is likely to be much higher than reported.

Africa recorded a 400% increase in measles, to more than 17,000 cases between January and March.

The WHO said the increase in cases is a ""worrying sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases and could trigger larger outbreaks"" that impact millions of children.

The agency noted that COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions, vaccine inequity and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving children without protection from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

The risk has been increased further by relaxed COVID-19 mitigation measures and displacement due to conflicts and crises.

COVID CASES DECLINE AGAIN LAST WEEK WORLDWIDE: WHO

""As measles is very contagious, cases tend to show up quickly when vaccination levels decline. The agencies are concerned that outbreaks of measles could also forewarn outbreaks of other diseases that do not spread as rapidly,"" it said.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted immunization services, health systems have been overwhelmed and we are now seeing a resurgence of deadly diseases including measles. For many other diseases, the impact of these disruptions to immunization services will be felt for decades to come,"" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said in a statement. ""Now is the moment to get essential immunization back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the measles virus spreads through the air and is very contagious.

It can also be serious, causing serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5.

About one in five people who get measles in the U.S. will be hospitalized, one out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling and one to three out of 1,000 will die – even with the best care.

The WHO notes that the measles virus weakens the immune system, making a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases for months after the infection.

Two doses of the measles vaccine can protect children against measles, but disruptions have delayed the introduction of the second dose of the measles vaccine in many countries.

""It woke me up -- it was extremely loud and lasted much longer than usual,"" said FOX Weather Meteorologist and Senior Weather Producer Greg Diamond. ""I'd estimate the loudest part lasted about 2-4 seconds and instead of the usual single loud crack of thunder sounds. There were multiple loud booms.""

US STRUCK BY 194 MILLION BOLTS OF LIGHTNING LAST YEAR

There were five cloud-to-ground lightning strikes measured in the Manhattan area, according to Chris Vagasky with Vaisala.

One of those bolts struck the top of the World Trade Center:

That's nothing new – Vagasky reports the WTC is struck by lightning about 109 times per year on average.

The reason for the figuratively ""super charged"" thunder was a temperature inversion sat over New York City. To those on the ground, the temperature was 51 degrees but up around 900 feet, the temperature had warmed to 54 degrees, instead of the usual cooling with height.

That inversion can trap sound waves near the surface, according to FOX Weather Meteorologist and Data Weather Specialist Shane Brown.

""Sound propagation can vary based on the temperature characteristics of the atmosphere near the point of origin,"" Brown said. ""In an environment where you have a shallow layer of cold air at the surface covered by warmer air aloft you can in a sense 'trap' the sound waves from refracting upwards. This leads to sound waves that tend to dissipate slower and can extend further in distance.""

124,Rocket Lab snatches rocket out of the sky using a helicopter on its first try,"After multiple days of uncooperative weather thwarted Rocket Lab's launch plans, the company launched a rocket and successfully caught it with a helicopter as it fell to Earth. The milestone moment was the first end-to-end test of this recovery technique.

Recovering rocket boosters and re-flying the hardware can save millions of dollars. SpaceX has been doing this for years, but the two companies have very different methods for landing their rocket boosters.

Electron launched from New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula just before 7 p.m. ET on the ""There and Back Again"" mission carrying 34 ride-sharing satellites to orbit.

AS HURRICANE SEASON NEARS, NASA IS LAUNCHING A FLEET OF TINY SATELLITES TO STUDY THE TROPICS

Rocket Lab's plan involved plucking a rocket booster out of the sky by catching it using a helicopter and parachute system. And the plan worked, on the company's first try.

After separation, the bottom half of the rocket began returning to Earth, performing a series of complex maneuvers to allow it to survey the extreme heat as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere. The rocket was traveling at almost 5,150 mph when it began its descent back to Earth.

A drogue parachute deployed from the booster about 7 minutes after liftoff, beginning to slow Electron down. Next, the main parachute deployed, slowing the booster down to about 22 mph to allow Rocket Lab's Sikorsky helicopter to catch the parachute.

There are only a few minutes in the recovery window for the helicopter to use a line and snag the parachute.

""We are all waiting on the edge of our seats,"" Rocket Lab communications representative Murielle Baker said.

The view from the chopper showed clouds and the line awaiting its catch for several minutes. Then, the orange and white parachute came into view and Rocket Lab declared that it had caught the booster.

""Helicopter catch!"" Rocket Lab tweeted after the parachute was seen on the helicopter's camera feed.

The helicopter was set to carry the booster to a nearby recovery vessel at sea. However, the pilot noticed different ""load characteristics"" than during tests and made the decision to drop the booster into the Pacific Ocean.

Baker said the booster remained in ""great condition"" and was picked up by the recovery ship.

""This is a monumental step forward in our program to make Electron a reusable vehicle,"" Baker said following the capture.

Rocket Lab pushed the launch date a few times due to weather. The company wanted to try on Friday and Sunday, but the weather was not in their favor both times.

""We don't usually give Mother Nature quite so much power over launch timing, but for our first helicopter catch attempt, we want to line up the best possible conditions to give us the highest chance of a successful catch,"" Rocket Lab tweeted last week. ""In time, we'll narrow those bounds.""

According to Rocket Lab Communications Director Morgan Bailey, the team is looking to avoid fog and low cloud cover to maximize visibility for the helicopter catch. Once the booster is caught by the helicopter, it will be offloaded to a boat at sea, which requires minimal wave height.

Rocket Lab mounted a camera on the booster and provided views from the rocket as it returned, but the feed quickly cut out.",https://www.foxweather.com/earth-space/after-weather-delays-rocket-lab-hopes-to-catch-a-rocket-returning-from-space

At the time, Mion was 12 years old. She had been sheltering in the attic of her family’s farm in San Pietro in Gù, a small commune in northeastern Italy, located in the Province of Padua.

The battle concluded by the time her 13th birthday came around on April 29, 1945. Her mother reportedly baked her a cake to celebrate and set it on their window sill to cool off.

As college graduation season approaches this year, here's a smart reminder: A college degree is not for everyone.

In a culture in which higher education is often promoted as a must-have for everyone, some very well known and successful individuals (in an array of fields) decided to ditch the academics in their own lives — and wound up doing very well thanks to hard work, enormous drive and total passion for their interests.

These eight prominent Americans left college behind and made it big.

Some of the most famous college dropouts in America include household names — and some of them may surprise you.

Here's a look at eight prominent Americans who left college behind and made it big.

Rush Limbaugh

Radio talk show host and media dynamo Rush Limbaugh will always be remembered for his impressive career in political and cultural commentary and broadcasting — all achieved without a college degree.

FORMER VP PENCE NARRATES ‘AGE OF RUSH,’ A LOOK AT THE MAN BEHIND THE GOLDEN MICROPHONE

The native of Cape Girardeau, Mo., was known as shy growing up, but there was no doubt he had a passion for radio broadcasting.

In the Fox Nation four-part series ""Age of Rush,"" narrated by former Vice President Mike Pence, excerpts from Limbaugh’s past piece together his trajectory in radio fame.

""I knew I wanted to do radio when I was 12,"" he said in a 2012 interview. ""Because I hated school. And getting ready for school every morning, my mother had the radio on. That guy was having fun — and I was having drudgery.""

COLLEGE DEGREE DOESN'T MEAN MORE MONEY: AMERICA'S CAREER COACH

Limbaugh landed his first radio job as a disc jockey at a local station before he completed high school. After his graduation in 1969, Limbaugh attended Southwest Missouri State College — and then dropped out to get back on the air.

In 1973, Limbaugh found himself in front of the mic once again under the alias Jeff Christie.

It would be another decade before Limbaugh launched his career in political commentary, influenced by former President Ronald Reagan’s persuasive radio presence. Limbaugh himself then influenced scores of others in his field throughout his legendary career.

Tiger Woods

Inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame this year, golf icon Tiger Woods risked his college diploma for a chance to go pro.

Following a childhood in which he developed his love of the links, Woods attended Stanford University in 1994, where he played NCAA golf and studied economics.

Woods won a record-tying 11 tournaments between his freshman and sophomore years at Stanford, but that's exactly how long his college experience would last.

When Woods was offered the opportunity to join the PGA in 1996, he made the decision to withdraw from the university to pursue his pro career.

TIGER WOODS' 20 MOST INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES AND LIFE LESSONS

Since his professional debut, Woods, 46, has clenched 106 worldwide wins and 15 majors. The golfer also has 82 PGA Tour wins under his belt — and is tied with Sam Snead, one of the greatest players of all time, for the most wins.

Woods, most recently, is the 12th-highest paid professional athlete in the world, according to Forbes, earning $60 million in 2021 alone.

Bill Gates

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates may very well be considered the pioneer of the college-dropout-turned-billionaire trend.

Gates ditched his promising education at Harvard University in 1975 after his first two years as a pre-law student. He had discovered his immense potential in the tech space.

Today, Microsoft is one of the largest tech companies in the world.

As part of an undergrad combinatorics course, Gates developed an algorithm to address an unsolved problem — which held the record for speed for 30 years, according to Best Colleges.

The young student decided to take a leave of absence from the university to found software company Microsoft — today one of the largest tech companies in the world. As of April 2022, it has a more than $2.1 trillion market cap.

The multi-billionaire, 66, has since given back big-time through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which works with partner organizations around the world. In 2021, the Gates Foundation doubled the total amount of donations with $15 billion in allocations, according to The Conversation.

Award-winning musician and artist Alicia Keys has brains, beauty and singing ability — but pursuing academics wasn’t in her make-up.

Keys graduated early from New York’s Professional Performing Arts high school as valedictorian at only 16 years old. The musician went on to attend Columbia University.

Keys has won 15 Grammy Awards and sold more than 65 million records worldwide.

College life, however, was short-lived for her in the 1990s: The teenager ditched Columbia University for a record deal with Columbia Records after one semester, Variety reported.

Even though her deal with Columbia fell through, Keys, 41, was saved by producer Clive Davis and signed to Arista Records shortly after, producing her debut album ""Songs In A Minor"" in 2001.

The hit album featured notable songs like ""Fallin,’"" which spent six weeks at no. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. The soul singer went on to win 15 Grammy Awards and 9 Billboard Music Awards. She has sold more than 65 million records worldwide.

Rachael Ray

Celebrity chef Rachael Ray knows what to cook up in the kitchen — and doing so didn’t require a college education.

The popular chef, known for her 30-minute meals, first attended Pace University in 1986 to study literature and communications. After two years, Ray dropped out to save money and re-focus her career goals, according to Good Housekeeping.

Rachel Ray's first cookbook sold 10,000 copies in two weeks.

Ray, 53, began offering cooking classes at a gourmet grocery store in Albany, N.Y., fueled by her love of working with food, which turned into demonstrations on local TV. By 1999, her first cookbook sold 10,000 copies in two weeks.

After making soup during a snowy segment of ""The Today Show"" in 2001, Ray’s career hit the ground running and she landed a contract with the Food Network.

""Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home,"" she has said.

Ryan Seacrest

Media personality Ryan Seacrest, born in Atlanta, always knew a life in broadcasting was for him, no matter the sacrifice.

After interning at Atlanta FM radio station WSTR in high school, he enrolled in the University of Georgia to pursue journalism in 1992.

Two years later, the college junior gave his first ""Seacrest, out!"" to college life and moved to Los Angeles. There, he fronted KYSR-FM’s afternoon drive-time show called ""Ryan Seacrest for the Ride Home.""

Ryan Seacrest’s higher education pursuit finally came full circle when he earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Georgia in 2016.

Seacrest’s emergence into the national limelight was arguably his 2002 debut as co-host of the TV singing competition ""American Idol.""

The emcee, 47, still hosts the program today — and has added to his on-screen repertoire. He took over the hosting of such iconic specials as ""Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.""

Seacrest’s higher education pursuit finally came full circle when he earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Georgia in 2016 after delivering the school’s commencement address that year.

Lady Gaga

Native New Yorker Lady Gaga, born and raised as Stefani Germanotta, always recognized her calling toward stardom.

The pop star grew up experiencing ridicule by her peers, but her passion for music fueled her fire to make it big. At the age of 11, Gaga began studying with Christina Aguilera’s vocal coach Don Lawrence and continued to practice classical piano and acting as a kid, Mic reported.

After graduating from high school, Gaga sought out an education at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. But it didn’t last long.

Gaga’s first album, ""The Fame,"" topped the charts, with tracks like ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"" hitting no. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100.

At 19 years old, the future star abandoned that life and dropped out of NYU to pursue her dreams. ""I left my entire family, got the cheapest apartment I could find and ate s--- until somebody would listen,"" she told New York Magazine in a 2010 interview.

After she was signed and then dropped by Def Jam records, Gaga was discovered by R&B artist Akon — who signed her to his own label in 2008.

Gaga’s first album, ""The Fame,"" topped the charts, with tracks like ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"" hitting no. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100.

LADY GAGA'S GREAT KINDNESS TOWARD LIZA MINNELLI: ETIQUETTE EXPERT SAID WE'VE OVERLOOKED IT

Gaga, 36, has won numerous awards and accolades during her career; was ranked fourth on VH1's Greatest Women in Music (2012); and was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in both 2010 and 2019.

John Mayer

There may be a running joke about the frequency of music school dropouts, but John Mayer, 44, turned the stigma into a success.

Mayer, who grew up in Fairfield, Connecticut, enrolled in Boston’s Berklee College of Music in 1998 but soon realized school wasn’t really his style.

In a 2002 interview with MTV, Mayer said his grades at Berklee ""were pronounced like ‘d-d-d-f-f-f-f-f’ — like static,"" as he had less professional training than his classmates.

The singer left the competitive music school and moved to Atlanta to pursue a solo career.

Three years later, he released his debut album, ""Room for Squares."" He won a Grammy Award in 2003 for the chart-topping hit ""Your Body Is a Wonderland.""

Mayer has taken home six more Grammys since.

In 2004, Mayer returned to Berklee – and taught a clinic on making it in the business.",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rush-limbaugh-tiger-woods-successful-college-dropouts

132,Mothers rallying to recall LA DA George Gascon say he ‘does not care about victims’; DA defends reforms,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Three Los Angeles-area mothers who lost their children to violent crime told Fox News they are pushing to recall Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon because he does not care about victims.

""I think he empathizes with every criminal out there and not with us. What did we do?"" asked Imelda Hernandez whose son, Christian David Silva, was shot and killed in February 2020.

""What does he think we’re going to do to him if we sit across the table?"" she continued. ""How come he doesn’t want to hear us out?

The recall campaign's organizers have said Gascon's policies are ""soft on crime,"" and that he should be ousted to ""keep communities safe."" The campaign announced last week that it had gathered 350,000 signatures. Nearly 567,000 are needed by the July 6 deadline.

LA DA GEORGE GASCON CAUSING ‘HAVOC AND MAYHEM,’ RECALL EFFORT WILL BE A ‘PHOTO FINISH,’ DEPUTY DA SAYS

Hernandez told Fox News she participated in two virtual meetings with Gascon, but said he ""just reads from a prompter.""

This is the second recall attempt Gascon has faced since he took office in December 2020. The 2021 attempt didn't gather enough signatures by the filing deadline to go to a vote.

Hernandez, who worked on the first recall attempt, has since moved to Orange County, where she's helping with District Attorney Todd Spitzer's reelection campaign. Spitzer's campaign slogan is #NoLAinOC.

""We have to have some kind of law and order,"" Emma Rivas told Fox News. ""George Gascon just doesn’t care about victims.""

Rivas’ son, Christopher Beasley, was shot and killed in 2016 when he was 25. Rivas has since become a board member of the Los Angeles chapter of Parents of Murdered Children.

She said she regrets voting for Gascon in 2020.

""I have voter's remorse,"" Rivas told Fox News. ""I’m ashamed because I didn’t do my research.""

She frequently attends Gascon recall rallies.

""I’m here because I regret voting for you,"" she told Fox News. ""But now that I have the opportunity to remove you, that’s exactly what I’m doing.""

Gascon issued a series of directives after taking office in December 2020 that have come under scrutiny.

Some include ordering his deputy district attorneys to stop seeking enhancement allegations, which can significantly extend prison sentences, not seeking the death penalty and barring prosecutors from charging juveniles as adults, regardless of the severity of the allegations.

Gascon's office defended his actions and his support for victims in a statement provided to Fox News.

""District Attorney Gascón's top priorities have been community safety and increasing support for victims,"" the statement said. ""This includes strengthening the Bureau of Victim Services and seeking serious penalties for serious crimes.""

""The false dichotomy between reform and caring for victims is just that – false,"" the statement continued. ""Justice should be about accountability and healing, not politics.""

During the campaign, Gascon responded to a Ballotpedia survey saying ""LA County deserves a more effective and progressive DA that enhances community safety without over incarcerating our communities.""

""I think it’s very important, people should realize when a DA runs for office, and he says ‘reform’ and ‘progressive’ and ‘science and data,’ watch out, because he’s not for you, he’s not for the public,"" Rivas said.

Another victim's mother, Anna Estevez, told Fox News: Gascon ""doesn’t see the trauma, the agony and the destruction that losing a child causes.""

Estevez's 5-year-old son, Aramazd Andressian Jr., was murdered by his father, her ex-husband, in 2017.

Gascon ""is pro-criminal, and I disagree wholeheartedly with his philosophy,"" Estevez told Fox News.

""What’s happening in LA County—I do not wish this to happen to your county, if you still have a county that’s civilized,"" Hernandez said. ""Do not be fearmongered by thinking differently on how you can change your community and your city.""

Estevez told Fox News that removing Gascon will not immediately fix Los Angeles' crime issues.

""With public support, I believe that we can reduce crime,"" she said. ""I believe that we can have a safe community.""",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/mothers-recall-los-angeles-da-george-gascon-does-not-care-about-victims
133,LA RIOTS 30TH ANNIVERSARY: Lifelong Los Angeles resident recounts what she witnessed as a child,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

On the 30th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots that shook America in 1992, we asked Triawna Wood, a lifelong Los Angeles resident, for her thoughts and insights.

Los Angeles erupted after the Simi Valley jury acquitted Officers Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Briseno for the beating of Rodney King. The riots lasted six days and when the smoke cleared, 63 people were killed, 2,383 were injured and more than 12,000 were arrested. The property damage was estimated to be well over $1 billion.

Wood was four and a half years old and living with her family in the Jordan Downs projects in the Watts neighborhood when the riots erupted. Today, she is a married Army veteran who homeschools her three children.

What follows is a Q&A that has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear Wood in her own words.

Q: Where were you when the Los Angeles riots began?

A: I was in preschool. My mom picked me up from school, we were coming back home. My normal routine was my mom would watch soap operas and once the soap operas went off, I knew that was my time to watch cartoons. But the soap operas got interrupted by the verdict. And I'm like, ""How long is this going to last? I want to see my shows.""

I remember my brother and sister coming home, my dad coming home, and then I guess hours later, you just started hearing noises outside. People were just outside, more than normal because it was usually pretty quiet. At this time we were living in the back, the very far back of the Jordan Downs projects, right before you got to Alameda. If there was like an earthquake, or random gunshots on a normal day, we would always go to the stairwell in the middle of the house, for safety, for shelter. I remember, specifically that night, spending that entire night curled up in my dad's lap on the upper part of the stairs, in the stairwell. The whole night, I fell asleep in his lap.

I'VE LIVED IN LA MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND I DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE

And then so the next day, my parents tried to tell us about what was going on. My brother and sister were old enough to understand more than I was. And they explained to me like, ""You're not going to school the rest of the week—at least, until they tell us when you can come back."" I was like, ""Okay."" So, we just pretty much hunkered down for most of the week.

Throughout the week, I remember my mom's friend bringing us groceries because she didn't live in the city. Because we couldn't come up here to this part of the neighborhood to go to the store, because this was the only grocery store in the area.

I remember the aftermath, the fallout later. After reemerging back into the world and looking at all the mom and pop shops, the liquor stores just boarded up or torn apart. And I remember thinking, as a little tiny four- or five-year-old, what do you make of this?

Q: What was the most vivid memory that you had?

A: The most vivid memory was learning that my family members, or people who were close to our family, weren't as savory of characters as I thought they were. I think that was the first time, specifically, a close relative of ours, I saw him in a different light. It was a person that I always thought was very protective, nice, funny. I didn't realize that this person was also into gang activity and took advantage of a time that was so violent, really. I think that was the first time that I saw him like that.

He wasn't mean when he came by our house or anything like that, but for him to offer ill-gotten goods, we were kind of like the black Brady Bunch. We were the wholesome family — in church every day, every week, year round. But that was the first time I had that interaction and was like, ""Oh, we do know people that's like the bad people you see on TV."" And that gave me a sense of the world is bigger than what I was aware of.

Q: Did you understand the anger of the rioters or were you more concerned with upholding law and order?

A: I remember my dad sitting down, explaining to me through his own stories of police harassment. And I started to understand like, ""Okay, I know now that some people are going to treat me differently, because of how I look.""

But, at the same time, I remember playing through my head, because I'd seen news clips of the Rodney King video, and I'm like, ""Well, but if he was doing something bad, aren't they supposed to beat him up and arrest him?"" But I didn't know that there should have been limits then. And so just putting all the puzzle pieces together as a young kid is like, ""Oh. So, you don't just beat somebody bloody and then arrest them."" But that's what I thought because that's what you see on TV, but you didn't expect to see it for real in life. And that was the first time that I realized, art imitates life.

Q: What do you think is the biggest lesson to be learned from the riots?

A: One thing I think people did take from it is: maybe we shouldn't destroy our own stuff. But I don't think that should have been the only thing that people should have took from it. I think that if we learn to look at things as not just black and white, but more nuanced on an individual basis and pause before we react, maybe we can think of a stronger way to react that has a better impact for a better outcome.

Q: Do you think the rioting sent a message or do you think it hurt the black community?

A: I think it hurt more. But I think it also came out of hurt. It just became this vicious revolving door of just pain on top of pain. Because of not knowing how to process that pain in a healthy way.

Q: Has the LAPD improved in the years since the riots?

A: To be honest, they said that they were making improvements. I've met with a few officers and chiefs over the years for various different reasons. Some of them, their hearts seem like it's in the right place. But I don't think that they've had maybe enough opportunities to really engage in the change, in the process of actually becoming better. And I think that's because, one, the community has no trust. And two, a lot of younger officers … that started to replace the ones that were retiring, had no interest in the community that they're serving. And I think if there is improvement to be made, that's where it starts — in forging a relationship with the people of the community.

One thing I learned from being in the service, when I was in the Army before I was supposed to go to Afghanistan, you’d have months on top of months of training. You're learning the language, you're learning about the people, you're learning about their customs. What's considered okay, what's not okay. How to behave, how to talk to people, how to shake hands. Before you even set foot on the plane, you need to understand all of these things. And I think the police could take a chapter out of that book. How can you protect and serve a group of people that you really don't understand at all?

Q: The Los Angeles riots changed Los Angeles forever. How did it change the city? How did it change you?

A: It was one of many experiences or events in my life that was another drop in the bucket that basically solidified an idea in my head that I live in a country that never really cared about people who look like me. And that's hard to sit with, and I felt that pain and that anger for years, before I was able to even really process it.

But as far as changing the city? Yeah, I think it changed the city a lot. Especially the black community because it's living through a trauma that never gets acknowledged, never is openly talked about. So there's never room to heal from it, but that's the black experience throughout American history.

But as far as the city at-large, I think it's changed how we provide security. Like the shopping center around here, back then there were no gates around it. There wasn't a time of night where everything just closed up, and there was no way in or out. And there's so many places like that. There's so many extra security measures, and I don't know if I necessarily feel safer because of that. And I think people take for granted the freedoms that we had in exchange for a false sense of security …

People were much more closed off after that. I think that's when I started to see the shift in people not getting to know their neighbors. Even growing up in the projects, even though my parents were strict, I wasn't allowed to just hang out and go and do whatever, but we knew the majority of our neighbors for rows and rows. Everybody knew each other because it was a community. I think after that, you started to see a decline in that sense of community. People stopped talking to each other for various reasons, but on a larger scale.

Q: It never recovered?

A: Never recovered. Even in the neighborhood I live in now, when we first moved there, I said hi to introduce myself. And people just looked at me like, ""The f***?"" Like, ""Who are you?"" And I'm like, ""Just saying hi, we just moved in."" People think that it's normal, but that's not what I grew up with.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Q: You talked about how you felt anger. Were you able to work through it or are you still working through it?

A: I didn't know that my dad had run-ins with the police before. I didn't know that was a reoccurring thing. And I didn't know that I would eventually experience similar things. Even on a milder scale, but still. And it was just kind of like, what do you do with that? So as a teenager—yeah, the angsty teen. But as a black teen, you're not allowed to express that because now you're a threat. So, it took me years to just work on me and realize that no matter what has happened in the world, what has happened throughout history, that does not dictate where I want to be and how I want to be. And it took me years to work through that, to process all of those emotions, how I viewed the world. It even took me a lot of changing my own perspective, time and time again. I actively sought to get out, to explore, because this couldn't be the only way of looking at life.

I think if there's anything to probably leave off with, it's that we all suffer some type of trauma or pain collectively. It's not just individually, and it's not just subjugated to the minority communities. It's always another perspective that's happening at the same time. And I think if we focus on learning to see how others perceive that same event or series of events and realize that we all suffered some type of trauma from it, we can connect on a deeper level of understanding, how it affected the individual and how it affected us at-large as a society. I think when you have shared pain, it makes you stronger. It makes it easier to bond. But we have to get out of our own individual pain first in order to experience that type of bond.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-riots-30th-anniversary-lifelong-los-angeles-resident-recounts-what-she-witnessed-as-a-child
134,LA RIOTS 30TH ANNIVERSARY: Former LAPD officer reflects on his experience,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

On the 30th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots that shook America in 1992, Fox News asked Michael P. Downing, a former top cop with the Los Angeles Police Department for his thoughts and insights.

Los Angeles erupted after the Simi Valley jury acquitted Officers Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno for the beating of Rodney King. The riots lasted six days. When the smoke cleared, 63 people were killed, 2,383 were injured and more than 12,000 were arrested. The property damage was estimated to be well over $1 billion.

Downing was a young man on the streets during the riots. He went on to serve 35 years with the LAPD and reached the department’s highest levels, including commanding officer, deputy chief, and interim chief of police.

What follows is a Q&A that has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear Downing in his own words.

Q: Where were you when the Los Angeles riots began?

A: I was a lieutenant assigned to 77th Division. I happened to be on vacation that week studying for the promotional exam and saw what was happening on the news. I immediately got in my car and drove to the station. I got off on Florence Avenue from the 110 freeway. There were gang members in the underpass as I was going through, there were gunshots all around.

I made it to the station. While I was on vacation, Lt. Mike Moulin had been put in my place, and I basically went into the station and got ready and went out to the command post at 52nd Street and Arlington Avenue.

(Note: The 77th Division was involved in the initial incident that sparked the riots. Two officers requested assistance in apprehending 16-year-old Seandel Daniels, who had thrown an object at their car. Moulin and approximately two dozen officers arrived to arrest Daniels. The gathering crowd became visibly upset at what they saw as the rough handling of Daniels. Moulin, fearing one of his outnumbered men would resort to deadly force, ordered his men to retreat.)

I'VE LIVED IN LA MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND I DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE

Q: Was the LAPD prepared for the possibility that its four officers would be acquitted for the beating of King?

A: We were worried that there was going to be isolated incidents throughout the city when the verdict was announced. There was some preparation. But you have to remember, back in that time, Police Chief Daryl Gates and Mayor Tom Bradley hadn’t spoken to one another in a couple of years. There was a good division between the mayor's office and the police department, and when we talk about putting credits in the bank and building trust with communities, it was strained. But I had no idea that it would light off like it did in terms of what we saw throughout the city.

Q: What was the most vivid memory you had?

A: It was a surreal scene for me to believe that we lived in the United States under a democracy, to see pure anarchy occurring before my eyes. To see black soot falling from the sky, to driving down streets and see gunfire come out of alleys, to see stores being looted, to see the Korean businessmen up on roofs defending their stores, firing weapons down, to seeing 52 dead bodies in a parking stall at the command post right next to the food truck that was feeding the cops and the first responders. That was a scene that was more conducive to what you would see in war than what you would see in a democratic society.

Q: Did you understand the anger of the rioters or were you more concerned with upholding law and order?

A: It's a balance. I was absolutely concerned with the anger. I was concerned hearing Bradley say: ""Go to the streets and voice your anger and show your anger."" That concerned me a little bit—a lot actually. I knew we had to restore order. I knew that it was anarchy, that it affected the entire city of Los Angeles. Buildings were burning, innocent people were getting hurt, police were getting hurt.

I knew that there was a balance. In public service and public safety and policing, we're not soldiers. We don't have enemies. We're public servants and most of the time, you control chaotic things by inspiring values and providing education and mobilizing resources.

In this case, cops had to become soldiers for a period of time and control through force and fear … When we have to become a different role and control through force and fear, we've failed in certain areas.

I was disappointed, I was disheartened, I was very sad at the scene that this had come to.

Q: How did other LAPD officers react to the acquittals of the officers involved in the beating of King?

A: Now that I've been retired for five years – I did 35 years with LAPD – I've come really to notice the division even within law enforcement on perspectives and opinions. More shocking than anything – and I think looking back to 1992 and listening to discussions in roll calls and discussions in locker rooms and discussions at the gas pumps at the time – I noticed that there was some division and different perspectives.

I don't know if it was freely talked about as much as it is today in different circles, and I think that's one of the big differences that I see today, especially with social media. You see the opinions of people that you never thought existed when you were on the department, especially in 1992. Had we had social media platforms, the Facebooks, the Instagrams, the Twitters, the LinkedIns back then, I think it would have been a lot more apparent, and not in a good way.

Q: What do you think is the biggest lesson to be learned from the riots?

A: We all know that democracy is fragile. I believe that the relationships with police in communities is fragile, that you will always have the cheerleaders, you'll always have the supporters, but you need to continually put credits in the bank with all communities. You can't just say ""the community"" today. It's communities because they're all different. They all have different experiences with government, with law enforcement, and you have to feed those communities with support, with services, with a voice, with interaction, with town hall meetings, with problem solving efforts, with access to government.

You can never stop because you know that a crisis is always on the horizon. You're always going to have a storm come, and you're going to have to take those credits out of the bank. You've got to make sure you're not bankrupt because, in 1992, we were bankrupt with certain communities in the city, and we didn't have any more stature.

(Note: The gang sweeps during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and during Operation Hammer, which began in 1987, led to the arrests of tens of thousands of people. Many were not charged.)

Social scientists believe that these things happen every 30 years. We certainly hope it doesn't happen like that today, but I do know that even when you look at Jan. 6, 2020, as kind of an analogy and leading up to the 2024 elections, I'm very worried about what could happen in this country.

I know the Joint Chiefs of Staff are very worried because they met about the potential for a civil war leading up to the 2024 election, and I know that's an extension of what we saw in 1992, but it's more of a national picture versus a localized picture.

The protests and demonstrations for this country are a good thing. For police and first responders and public servants to facilitate protests, so that they're orderly, so people can speak their mind and if they need to appeal or protest against a policy or a governmental procedure or something, that needs to be in place. There needs to be listening mechanisms in place and there needs to be some type of action taken to address them.

That's what our democracy was built on. If you suppress the ability to protest and demonstrate, you're going to have a pressure cooker type of problem where the lid is going to be blown off and you're going to have another riot.

VIDEO MONTAGE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY METRO SYSTEM SHOWS SHOOTINGS, ASSAULTS, PEOPLE THROWN ON TRAIN TRACKS

Q: Has the LAPD improved in the years since the riots?

A: I think the Los Angeles Police Department has improved in many ways. I think the one mechanism that really created a lot of evolution and improvement and reform within the police department was the consent decree that we were under for 10 years.

That really concerned me when we went through this whole debate about defunding the police and starting over. You can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Everybody knows that reform is a continual thing and that probably the greatest adversary we have is complacency and status quo. We can never have that.

But if you look at the type of organization, even back to the 1930s, where we were a politically controlled police department and then we went into a reform police department and then we went into the era of being a professional police department and then we went into the era of community-based policing police department and we've played with this other era of intelligence-led or predictive-led policing, but the foundation of policing is always based on communities.

The one principle that holds true is people are the police and police are the people. The police department has to reflect what the people look like, how they feel, what their values are. We can never move away from that idea.

Have we improved? When you look at the consent decree, 187 paragraphs of improvement were written in that consent decree. I think when we ended it 10 years later, we were somewhere in the neighborhood of 97% compliance.

There's always the potential to slip and go back or default back to where you were. That is eliminated by or mitigated by excellent leadership, by continually looking back and critiquing, by having people who don't necessarily agree with you, to have them be a voice and be reflective on that voice and listen to the critiques.

Civilian oversight is so important to the Los Angeles Police Department. I wish there was a better way to have civilian oversight where they weren't so much attached to the mayor's office and/or to city council but they did reflect the values of a civilian commission that would oversee and be the board of directors of a police department.

I think some of the problems that we've gone back to is we've become politicized … When you politicize a police department the way it's been politicized today, you see what happens in Los Angeles and you're seeing what's happening to it now. Crime is going up, violence is going up, and the physical stature of the community looks horrible with homeless encampments. It's not good for the homeless.

It's because the police hands have been tied and there hasn't been a plan and there hasn't been good leadership. We need to get back to the basics. Communities need to participate. We need to listen to communities. We need to create better partnerships in communities. We need to solve these quality of life problems and the big things will take care of themselves, but we need to get back to basics.

What concerns me is that if we don't and this continues to devolve and continues to whirl in this downward spiral, we're going to be back to where we were 30 years ago.

Q: How has the LAPD sought to become more reflective of its communities?

A: We got to a point where I believe that we didn't really have to say we have an affirmative action policy and we need these certain percentages in the department because we had those percentages and it was created through equal opportunity, through recruitment, through giving everybody opportunities for promotion.

I think we had to reflect that diversity up through the rank structure of LAPD, which is happening. A good example is my watch commander when I was a captain in the Hollywood Division. Before I retired, she became my boss. She was an assistant chief and I was a deputy chief. I was thrilled, because I had a little piece of that to give her, to see her succeed. It was fantastic.

I think when you look at the diversity of women on the police department, it looks pretty good. I think we have to improve a little bit when it comes to minorities. I think we always have those goals and I think there's opportunities for everyone now. It's not perfect. We need to continue to reform.

But there was a point where we had to say, ""Let's manage the diversity now so that we can reflect it up through the rank structure and let's not stigmatize it so that we create a system where we're just promoting people or recruiting people to fill a quota."" Because then that creates really a stigma against that person because there's a belief, ""Well, you only got this position because of your ethnicity or your gender."" That could be equally as damaging.

Q: The Los Angeles Riots changed Los Angeles forever. How did it change the city? How did it change you?

A. How it changed me? It made me believe that however good I thought we were, we had a long way to go and that we had a lot of improvement to do. And that sometimes you have to let go of being right and create enough room in the glass to listen to people, react to people, allow people to see change and reform take place and be accountable to that.

When you get inculcated in a culture, sometimes that culture doesn't serve you very well and you need outside influences to continually question what you're doing … to make sure that you don't get stuck in this groupthink type of mentality.

Are arrests a really good measure of success? I've learned that it's probably not. You know, leading up to the riots, we went through all these different initiatives, battle plans and operation plans and it didn't serve us very well, because it created more of a military mentality, a quasi-military mentality … We should be leaning much more toward public service and serving with a public servant's heart and understanding the nature of what communities really need and what they really want in terms of how we approach our job.

It made me think that's the type of leader that I want to be. I want to be an inclusive leader, a coach and somebody that listens to a variety of opinions.

How it changed the city … I think the city still is at the point where it's fragile and I think you've seen what's happened over the last nearly 10 years or so … If you take your eye off the ball, you're going to default back to what it was. I think that's what we're seeing right now.

In the 2000s, we had homicides that were under 300 per year, whereas in the '90s, they were almost over 1,000 I think a year. Obviously, 300 is way too many. One is way too many. The violence is starting to curb up again. The physical stature of the communities is starting to look bad again. There needs to be a reset. We need to refocus on how we're approaching this problem while still keeping compassion and empathy toward under-served communities and making sure we push social services and mental health and triage those communities.

It's this idea of how do we achieve this rule-based approach and a care-based approach so that we don't have anarchy but we don't have lack of freedoms as well, but that we provide inspiration to communities to become good partners, so that we're doing it together and it's not just a police department problem.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-riots-30th-anniversary-former-lapd-officer-reflects-on-his-experience
135,"LA DA George Gascon causing ‘havoc and mayhem,’ recall effort will be a 'photo finish,' deputy DA says","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A leading voice in the movement to oust Los Angeles County’s top prosecutor told Fox News the race to collect the number of signatures required to put a recall question on the ballot will come down to the wire.

""I believe that we will get the required signatures to get the recall of [District Attorney] George Gascon on the ballot,"" Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami said. ""However, it is going to be a photo finish.""

""It will be very close,"" he added. ""It is going to require the entire movement to keep working together until the last day, which is something I and all of us intend to do.""

This is the second recall attempt Gascon has faced since he took office in December 2020. A 2021 attempt didn't gather enough signatures by the filing deadline to go to a vote.

LOS ANGELES GASCON RECALL ORGANIZERS OPTIMISTIC AS MORE SIGNATURES KEEP COMING IN

""We have a district attorney right now who's causing havoc and mayhem in Los Angeles,"" Hatami told Fox News. ""He's hurting public safety here in Los Angeles.""

""His policies are making it more dangerous for individuals,"" he continued.

Gascon’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

The recall campaign announced it has gathered roughly 350,000 signatures to date. Organizers need to collect 566,857 signatures total – 10% of registered voters in the county – by the July 6 deadline.

Hatami, a child abuse prosecutor with 16-years of experience in the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, has been vocal about his support for booting Gascon.

""I think probably 99% of the people in Los Angeles would make a better DA than George Gascon,"" Hatami told Fox News.

After riding a wave of progressive candidates campaigning to head some of the nation's busiest DA offices, Gascon ousted his predecessor, Jackie Lacey, and immediately issued a series of directives that have come under heavy scrutiny.

Some include ordering his deputy district attorneys to stop seeking enhancement allegations, which can significantly extend prison sentences, not seeking the death penalty and barring prosecutors from charging juveniles as adults, regardless of the severity of the allegations.

""I had heard about George Gascon and the type of person he was,"" Hatami said. ""But I guess in my heart, I thought … somebody who was a DA in San Francisco, who was a police officer for 30 years, he wouldn't do this.""

The directive related to juveniles has since been modified after the case of Hannah Tubbs, a 26-year-old transgender woman who at 17 sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl. Tubbs was sentenced to two years in a youth facility and was caught on a jailhouse phone call bragging about the light punishment.

LA DA GEORGE GASCON KNEW ABOUT TRANS CHILD MOLESTER HANNAH TUBBS JAIL CALLS BEFORE SENTENCING, DEPUTY DA SAYS

""It broke me … to give somebody who molested a child six months to two years. It's heartless,"" said Hatami, who told Fox News the victim’s family had reached out to him on the case. ""He is not a good person. This is not political. He may say it is, but it’s not.""

Violent crime is up 7.2% from this time last year, according to Los Angeles Police Department data. Total arrests are down 15.1%.

More than 9 of 10 Los Angeles prosecutors supported an effort to recall Gascon , the Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys reported in February.

During a press conference in December, Gascon defended his progressive policies.

""Rather than turning every tragedy into a political football and blame game, I ask that those people please join us,"" said Gascon. ""We can do better, we will go further if we all work together.""

Despite working in the same building as Gascon in downtown Los Angeles, Hatami told Fox News he has never met his boss.

""I don't know how to describe the working relationship because most bosses that I've had have taken the time to come out and meet their employees,"" Hatami said. ""I'm one of the top child abuse prosecutors here in Los Angeles, and George Gascon has never tried one single case, and so you would think somebody like that would come down here and meet with me.""

""I’ve publicly said I’ll debate him, if he wants to do that,"" Hatami continued. ""My door is always open.""

136,Oklahoma leaders give exclusive look into their Supreme Court arguments,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Oklahoma governor, attorney general and solicitor general gave Fox News an inside look into their arguments in their U.S. Supreme Court case over state sovereignty.

The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a case regarding whether Oklahoma has the authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes on reservations against Indians. The state argued that it should be allowed to serve justice for its citizens and that the federal and tribal governments can't keep up with the number of crimes committed. Oklahoma tribes have said those claims are untrue and undermine tribal sovereignty.

""We have crimes without punishment. We have victims without justice,"" Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor told Fox News. ""If somebody steals the car of a Native American, they might as well forget it because there's no law enforcement that's going to be able to come and help them because the state of Oklahoma can't.""

JUSTICES TO HEAR OKLAHOMA APPEAL IN TRIBAL JURISDICTION CASE

Gov. Kevin Stitt told Fox News: ""We're asking the Supreme Court for the authority to protect law and order in Oklahoma. We have lost the ability, as a state, to prosecute crimes when there's a native victim.""

""We want to be able to protect every single person in eastern Oklahoma regardless of their race,"" he said. ""The state should be able to prosecute those crimes, and right now we have simply lost that jurisdiction.""

The case, Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, centers on Victor Castro-Huerta, a non-native who was convicted in an Oklahoma Court of neglecting his 5-year-old Native American stepdaughter while living on the Cherokee Nation reservation. The state's highest criminal appeals court overturned Castro-Huerta's conviction in 2021, finding that Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction.

Oklahoma Solicitor General Mithun Mansinghani, who attended Wednesday's hearing, left feeling optimistic that the Court would side with the state.

""I think the justices were very engaged with the arguments here,"" he told Fox News. ""And because we're confident that we're right in the law, I'm confident that the justices will see it our way.""

Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., however, felt the law was on the tribal government's side.

""Congress has been clear on the limits of state jurisdiction on our reservations, and Governor Stitt’s anti-tribal views don’t change those facts,"" Hoskin said in a statement released after the oral arguments.

""While tribes have worked closely with our partners to meet our public safety responsibilities and provide a blanket of protection to everyone on our reservation, it’s unfortunate that the state has wasted time and resources attacking our rights and sovereignty,"" the statement continued.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % C CITIGROUP INC. 48.71 +0.50 +1.04%

""We’re selling our consumer and our commercial banking franchise on the ground there, and we’re in active dialog around that,"" Fraser said in a Bloomberg Television interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference.

Investors have been worried that the sale was in limbo because of economic sanctions western nations have imposed to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

REPUBLICANS PUSH HOUSE TO DROP CITIGROUP AS OFFICE CREDIT CARD PROVIDER OVER FUNDING FOR ABORTION TRAVEL

Fraser announced in April 2021 that Citi would divest its Russia consumer business along with a dozen other consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA markets that she said were too small to keep. Citi has since found buyers for many of those businesses.

Fraser also said in the interview that Citigroup will continue to serve multi-national corporations in Russia because they need the bank to shutdown their businesses there.

""We’ve stopped soliciting new business, new clients. We’re clearly shrinking down our exposures, our business,"" Fraser said. ""But you're kind of the captain who’s the last one off the ship.""

Earlier in the day, Fraser said in a panel discussion at the conference that western countries' use of sanctions as a weapon against Russia is prompting some of Citi's international clients to explore new ways to conduct trade and finance.

CITI NAMES ANGEL NG AS HEAD OF ASIA PACIFIC FOR GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT

In the Middle East, Fraser said, ""you hear the clients there talk about the fact that they don't trust the western financial order to put all of their eggs in that basket going forward, that they are going to be looking at other places.""

Fraser added: ""You have to anticipate the splintering of the old global financial order, the acceleration of new venues.""

Ancora Holdings Inc. has a roughly 1% stake in Hasbro and wants it to explore a full or partial sale of Entertainment One, its unit focused on creating television shows and other content, according to a letter the activist sent to the company’s board that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. It also wants the company to replace longstanding directors on its board.

Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro has a market value of roughly $12.5 billion and sells brands including Play-Doh and Monopoly. While it received a boost in the early days of the pandemic as lockdowns spurred parents to spend on toys, its shares are trading below where they were five years ago.

DON'T BET AGAINST AMAZON: FMR. TOYS 'R' US CEO

Ancora joins Alta Fox Capital Management LLC, a little-known activist that in February unveiled a 2.5% stake in Hasbro and nominated five directors to the company’s board. Alta Fox urged the company to explore a spinoff of its fast-growing Wizards of the Coast gaming unit, which includes games like Dungeons & Dragons. It also criticized the company’s roughly $4 billion 2019 purchase of Entertainment One, which is known for the children’s show ""Peppa Pig.""

Ancora said in its letter Hasbro should replace longstanding directors with Alta Fox’s nominees. The activist also said Hasbro should review options for Entertainment One because it doesn’t fit well with the rest of the business and proceeds from a sale could be reinvested elsewhere. Ancora also said Hasbro should continually consider alternatives for the Wizards of the Coast unit, which it believes the market is overlooking.

Hasbro in early April rejected Alta Fox’s calls to spin off Wizards of the Coast, concluding that doing so would diminish benefits the division gets from the company’s long-standing strategy which focuses on telling stories around its brands. It also added two directors to its board, an executive from chat app-company Discord Inc. and a former executive of gaming company Electronic Arts Inc. Chris Cocks took over as Hasbro chief executive in February following the death last year of longtime CEO Brian Goldner.

Hasbro said in a statement that Alta Fox’s campaign began shortly after Goldner’s death and ""is a distraction at a time when our new CEO should be given a chance to focus solely on our business.""

Hasbro shareholders are set to vote on the competing director slates June 8, unless the two sides settle before then.

The activist pressure comes as Hasbro’s rival Mattel Inc. has held talks with private-equity firms about a potential sale, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. The two have been fierce competitors over the years and in 2017, Hasbro made an unsuccessful takeover offer for Mattel.

143,"Guidelines for health are meant to guide, not mandate","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

When the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force came out last week against the routine use of aspirin as a preventive in people over 60, citing the risk of bleeding, it did not change my clinical decision-making one iota, and instead reminded me of a basic truth in medicine, patients must be seen and treated as individuals, guidelines are intended to guide, and are not meant to be converted to mandates or dictums.

Don’t get me wrong, a smart clinician should be mindful of a bleeding risk whenever recommending aspirin, and this risk certainly increases with age, but so does the risk that you are building up sticky plaque that could lead to a sudden heart attack or stroke, and a good doctor can weigh the risk/benefits of any drug including aspirin much better than a guideline can.

This brings to mind another time the USPSTF tried to alter the practice of clinical medicine with a superimposed guideline, when they discouraged the routine use of the Prostate Specific Antigen in man over the age of 70, despite the fact that the PSA had led to the earlier diagnosis of prostate cancer leading to more surgical cures.

DOES A DAILY ASPIRIN HELP PEOPLE OVER 60 AVOID HEART DISEASE AND STROKE? EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS JUST CHANGED

Still, this august group pointed to the knee-jerk biopsies and surgeries that frequently resulted from an elevated PSA, which did not prolong life. Whereas I and many urologists and primary care physicians disagreed, arguing that the PSA was a useful tool, and the information it gave you valuable. It wasn’t a PSA that ordered a biopsy, it was a clinician.

To this day I routinely check the PSA on many men over the age of 45, and I act on the result based on many factors including genetics. No good doctor knee jerks anything.

The guideline problem has gotten worse during the COVID pandemic, when lockdowns, closures, vaccine and mask mandates have followed straight from guidelines.

The public has now lost the sense of guidelines guiding physicians, and is reacting negatively instead to the new normal of guidelines leading directly to mandates. The politicization of guidelines is not good for public health whether it applies to vaccine mandates without a carve out for natural immunity or testing negative the way Israel and the European Union has had, or to costly school closures, or to mask mandates without attention paid to what type of mask, whether they are effective or not, and whether taking them off to eat or drink erodes the essential public health strategy.

This lack of public health consistency was born out by Florida federal court judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle’s ruling against the CDC’s transportation mask mandate on planes, trains, and busses, based on a disagreement over the term ""sanitation"" as well as the fact that the CDC didn’t call for a public referendum prior to instituting the rule. This court action has opened a Pandora's box that will likely end in the Supreme Court and could hamper or restrict CDC’s powers.

Population studies have indicated an apparent effectiveness for proper mask use in areas of high viral spread but because of the heavy hand of mandates, as soon as they are lifted there is scarcely a mask in sight.

This type of on again, off again or red light/green light is hardly consistent with good public health policy. I may choose to continue to fly with an N95 mask, but now I am practically the only one at the airport or on the plane wearing one.

What a difference a year makes. In the spring of 2021, China was reporting only a few dozen COVID cases each day and celebrating a return to steady economic growth. The United States, meanwhile, reeled from its worst death wave of the pandemic.

Media outlets around the world, from the Chinese Ministry of Propaganda to the New York Times, were quick to declare that China had ""won"" the pandemic, having decisively defeated the virus and demonstrated the virtues of unbridled autocracy. Xi Jinping was set to use China’s apparent COVID success as a central argument for enshrining himself, at the upcoming Communist Party Congress in October 2022, as emperor-for-life.

Fast-forward to today. While most Americans travel mask-free around their country, several hundred million Chinese citizens are locked down in their apartments, many without reliable access to food or medical care. Reports of people dying at home of easily treatable ailments are proliferating, as are videos of desperate residents screaming for help and clashing with police.

SHANGHAI TESTS TO LOOSEN COVID LOCKDOWN

With one out of every four Chinese citizens under lockdown and 87 of China’s 100 largest cities imposing some form of restriction on movement, supply chains have ground to a halt. Some leading economists think China could suffer zero growth or even an economic contraction this year—compounding what was already a decade-long trend of slowing growth, declining productivity, and surging debt.

China’s COVID debacle is a symptom of deeper problems. Under Xi, China’s already-autocratic system has veered toward a personalistic totalitarianism that makes it hard for the country to shift course when the supreme leader is committed to a bad idea—such as a ""zero COVID"" policy that has condemned the country to repeated, growth-killing lockdowns. Nor can China vaccinate its way out of the pandemic. Its biotech sector cannot match the West’s success in crafting mRNA-enabled wonder drugs, and Xi’s growing antagonism toward the outside world has made the idea of protecting the population with American or European vaccines a non-starter.

The pandemic, moreover, is accentuating the excruciating demographic crunch caused by China’s long-time one-child policy, bringing forward the date at which the country’s population will peak and then begin a catastrophic, productivity-crushing decline.

SHANGHAI WARNS RESIDENTS WHO VIOLATE COVID LOCKDOWN WILL FACE PUNISHMENT: REPORT

China’s predicament today is simply a preview of what it will face in the coming decade, as a host of long-building economic, political, and demographic bills come due.

Some Americans might be tempted to gloat over China’s COVID woes, but they should resist the urge. Slowing growth and worsening societal problems lockdowns might make China a less competitive long-term rival to the United States: The odds of Beijing effortlessly displacing Washington as the world’s most powerful country are actually quite slim. Yet those same problems could also make China a more explosive near-term threat.

As we show in our forthcoming book, ""Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China,"" the most dangerous countries are not rising powers but peaking powers: Countries that want to reorder the world but are losing confidence that time is on their side.

When once-rising powers run into persistent economic stagnation, they typically become more repressive at home and more repressive abroad. Japan, for instance, turned toward totalitarianism and began its military rampage across Asia after the economic crises of the 1920s and then the Great Depression ended its long run of prosperity. China seems to be headed down the same ugly path today.

Since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, slowing Chinese growth has gone hand-in-hand with efforts to dominate the resource-rich South China Sea, lock up markets and commodities through the Belt and Road Initiative, and carve out a technological sphere of influence encompassing much of the developing world. Since the onset of COVID, Beijing has become more belligerent still.

Xi’s government has conducted menacing military exercises near Taiwan, sparking a deadly border clash with India, and issuing chilling threats to use nuclear weapons against Japan. Even before Russia attacked Ukraine, U.S. military officials had begun to warn, publicly, that China could launch a major war in the Western Pacific—probably against Taiwan—in the next few years.

Western observers have often interpreted growing Chinese assertiveness as a sign of growing Chinese confidence. But it may simply represent Xi’s increasing willingness to use coercion and force to secure China’s objectives, as he becomes less convinced that Beijing can peacefully overtake its rivals.

More than two years into the pandemic, Americans should be thankful that they don’t live in a police state where the most heavy-handed COVID crackdowns appear likely to persist well into the future. But they should also be alert to the fact that the danger of war may increase, rather than decrease, as China peaks and begins to decline.

145,WaPo reporter caught maskless at White House Correspondents' Dinner despite expressing COVID fears,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A Washington Post reporter was caught maskless at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday despite complaining about the crowd and expressing fears about the spread of the coronavirus.

""This room is like a horror film. No exits. Literally getting trapped between tables. Fear of breathing near people but people are everywhere. Creeping sense that you’re the only one who know this is insane,"" Jada Yuan wrote on Twitter during the event, including a picture that showed a crowd of people seated at tables close together.

WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER RETURNS AFTER TWO-YEAR HIATUS

Yuan was, however, later seen in a photo taken at the event showing her maskless, smiling and standing in a crowd of people.

Critics took to social media to mock Juan, with some pointing out the maskless photo, and others her decision to attend the event and remain there despite her expressed concerns.

""Were you being held hostage?"" wrote Charles C.W. Cooke, senior writer at the National Review, with Christina Pushaw, press secretary for Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, responding with the maskless photo of Juan and saying, ""Doesn't look like it.""

BIDEN JOKES ABOUT LOW APPROVAL, ‘LET’S GO BRANDON' IN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' SPEECH

Democratic strategist Madeline Conway argued that by Juan's logic ""people would literally sit inside their homes doing nothing forever.""

""Do get a grip. What’s ‘insane’ is you feeling compelled to both attend and then stay.."" wrote Fox Nation host Piers Morgan, while writer Bethany Mandel likened Juan's reaction about the event's crowd to ""mental illness.""

Journalist Ksenija Pavlovic McAteer pointed out that attendance at the event was voluntary, while American Majority CEO Ned Ryun wrote, ""I am so sorry that you were forced to go and then held hostage. . .""

Juan responded to the criticism on Sunday, writing, ""A few things: a) I was on assignment to cover. b) everyone was vaxxed, boosted & same-day tested. c) as a reporter roaming the party, I felt the crush of the crowd more than those sitting at tables. d) my sense of doom is no judgment on anyone else.

147,SCOTUS draft leak likely a liberal clerk seeking to stop an overturn of Roe v. Wade: Dershowitz,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The bombshell leak of an apparent draft of a decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade is likely the product of an ideologically leftist law clerk seeking either to halt a nixing of the abortion ban or to engender support for court-packing, Alan Dershowitz told Fox News.

The leaked draft, written in February, was reportedly crafted by George W. Bush-appointed Justice Sam Alito.

Dershowitz, a longtime Harvard Law professor, said he strongly opposes overturning the 1973 ruling, but emphasized this leak is an egregious violation of legal ethics.

SUPREME COURT DRAFT OPINION LEAKS

""I know Justice Alito, I know his writings. This sounds like a decision, a majority decision of the Supreme Court overruling Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

""And I have a theory and it's only a theory: I think this was leaked by a liberal law clerk who is trying to change the outcome of the case – either by putting pressure on some justices to change their mind or by getting Congress to pack the court even before June, which is very unlikely.""

DERSHOWITZ: MUELLER REPORT ‘SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN’

Thirdly, Dershowitz stated, the leak could be intended to pressure Congress to federally codify Roe v. Wade's abortion ban and prevent the future legality of states enacting their own abortion laws.

Moments thereafter, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, publicly demanded Roe indeed be passed into law or that the filibuster be killed in order to do so with 50 votes.

Dershowitz told ""Hannity"" that he believes the draft is indeed authentic and that the leaker definitely wants to change the outcome of the forthcoming opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson, Mississippi, Women's Health Organization.

The case in question focuses on the Constitutionality of a 2018 law in the Magnolia State banning abortion after 15 weeks.

Later, Dershowitz added that the leaker could be considering themselves engaged in ""civil disobedience"", despite the possibility they will be disbarred, fired from the Supreme Court among other punishments.",http://www.foxnews.com/media/supreme-court-roe-wade-draft-leak-dershowitz-law-clerk-alito
148,Geraldo to Piers Morgan: Russian invasion puts global security risk at level of Cuban Missile Crisis,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued sabre-rattling about detonating a nuclear weapon in his war on Ukraine is a danger not felt worldwide since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Geraldo Rivera said on ""Piers Morgan Uncensored.""

In an interview with Fox Nation host Piers Morgan, Rivera said the mutually-assured-destruction dynamic that prevents such dangers is at risk with an ""insane"" autocrat like the former KGB agent at the top of the Kremlin.

""How it ends, I have no idea, but the nuclear sabre-rattling has rattled me as a child of the 1950s who used to duck under our desks at school in nuclear drills that would have been fruitless,"" he said.

SEXTON CALLS OUT BIDEN'S DISINFO BOARD HYPOCRISY

""[A man] who lived through as a cadet in Maritime College, the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the worst it's been since then. People have to understand when people are talking about nuclear or use of nuclear weapons in a way that it is plausible, if remote, it is unnerving to me.""

Rivera further reported on rumblings that Putin may fire a ""tactical"" nuke that would detonate over an unpopulated area like the middle of the Black Sea as a ""demonstration"", calling it further example of his insanity.

The ""Five"" host went on to hearken back to grade school and was reminded of something a civics teacher told him that shook him at the time.

Rivera said the teacher once told him thar Adolf Hitler – if given the choice between suicide or taking an action to end the world – he would have chosen the latter.

Rivera said he fears the same may be true for Putin, who he said appears to be losing in Ukraine after abandoning his quest for Kyiv and instead fighting mercilessly in the Donbas and coastal regions.

""Is Putin now playing with the button because he may lose this ridiculous, stupid war?"" he asked.

Rivera praised the Ukrainian government for its handling of the invasion, and also criticized former President Donald Trump for what he saw as actions seeking to undermine NATO, citing in one case the then-president's concern over nations not paying their 2% commitment.

""He was so disparaging of them, and it sounded like he wanted the Atlantic Alliance gone -- that he didn't even think the United States should be in the in NATO. What if there was no NAITO now?"" he asked.

149,Disinfo Board depicts Biden as most anti-free-speech president since John Adams: Turley,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Biden's administration is revealing itself to be the most anti-free-speech White House since the 18th Century, GWU law professor Jonathan Turley told Fox News on Monday.

The advent of the Department of Homeland Security's ""Disinformation Governance Board"" is the latest in a ""chilling"" record of counter-First-Amendment behavior, he said.

The office's inaugural leader, Nina Jankowicz, is therefore ""pitch perfect"" for the role, he said.

""President Biden… is arguably the most anti-free-speech president since John Adams,"" Turley commented, adding DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas ironically said it well when he has spoken about the new appointment.

PIRRO: BIDEN'S DISINFO BOARD MORE ORGANIZED THAN UKRAINE, AFGHANISTAN ACTIONS

""When the secretary says, ‘She has a long background here’ -- Well, it's the wrong background. It's like saying a book burner has a background in literacy: Yeah, he works with books, but that's not the background you're looking for.""

DISINFO BOARD BETTER SUITED FOR ‘DICTATORSHIPS’: GABBARD

Of Mayorkas' defense of Jankowicz' role, Turley said while she may be tasked with ""offer[ing] best practices on how to fight disinformation, many of us in the free speech community respond with, Yeah, we can pretty much guess what those are.""

Of Adams, the Sedition Act of 1798 was passed during his tenure in the name of national security amid tensions with France -- which eventually led to a sitting member of Congress being jailed.

President Biden's new ""Disinformation Governance Board"" has materialized because the leftist establishment doesn't like their speech to have ""competition,"" Greg Gutfeld said Monday on ""The Five.""

The board, set to be headed by Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, has sparked concerns it will infringe on Constitutionally-protected civil liberties.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, however, defended the board, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" he could have done a better job in communicating what it does.

On ""The Five"", Gutfeld said the board has more to do with competition than speech itself.

DISINFO BOARD BETTER SUITED FOR DICTATORSHIPS: GABBARD

""They don't like their freedom of speech to have any competition. They think, I believe, that they see speech as a zero-sum game -- if Joey has more speech, then that means somebody at MSNBC has less speech. That's the way they see it. That's why it's wrong,"" he said.

Gutfeld added that the controversy also shows establishment media understands that they are in decline, and that other free speech could be a threat to their ecosystem:

""I think the legacy media … know that it just it's not too far off from being dead … They're watching their numbers decline. And every time there's a threat, they go crazy.""

He added that, while many see Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the chief concern among the anti-free-speech left, such proverbial risks to the establishment dynamic have been recurring for some time.

Gutfeld said that as far back as October 1996, that dynamic felt threatened by the conception of Fox News Channel, and later, journalists like Glenn Greenwald and commentators like Joe Rogan.

""Now it's Musk. So every reaction you see is the same. They fear speech because it competes with theirs,"" he said, adding that Mayorkas notably stated the new disinformation apparatus will work against speech's ""connectivity to violence.""",http://www.foxnews.com/media/gutfeld-dhs-disinfo-board-left-free-speech

Democratic governors and attorneys general responded to the alleged draft of a forthcoming Supreme Court opinion striking down Roe v. Wade with horror and a renewed dedication to abortion rights.

The draft, which the Court refused to confirm or deny and which appears to date back to February, would reverse Roe v. Wade (1973) and allow the states to make their own laws on the hot-button issue of abortion. Since this is a draft, reported by Politico, and not an official signed opinion, Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land. Drafts circulate and change.

""I am horrified by the apparent draft Supreme Court opinion leaked this evening that would overturn the right to abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade,"" Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. ""For the sake of women across the country, this should not be the Supreme Court's final opinion when it comes to abortion rights.""

SUPREME COURT SET TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, LEAKED DRAFT OPINION SHOWS: REPORT

Hochul said she refuses ""to go backwards"" on the issue. ""I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights generations have fought for and won, rights that she should be guaranteed,"" she said.

""For anyone who needs access to care, our state will welcome you with open arms,"" the governor added. ""New York will always be a place where abortion rights are protected and where abortion is safe and accessible. Just as the Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp tall in our harbor, New York will never stop fighting for what's right — unafraid and undeterred.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., called the draft an ""appalling attack on the rights of women.""

""This draft opinion is an appalling attack on the rights of women across this country and if it stands, it will destroy lives and put countless women in danger,"" he said in a statement Monday. ""It will be the end of fundamental constitutional rights that American women have had for nearly 50 years.""

Newsom claimed that the draft opinion shows that the Court ""does not value the rights of women.""

""We have a Supreme Court that does not value the rights of women, and a political minority that will stop at nothing to take those rights away,"" he said. ""This won’t stop with choice and the right to privacy. They are undermining progress, and erasing the civil protections and rights so many have fought for over the last half century.""

""We have to wake up. We have to fight like hell. We will not be silenced,"" he concluded.

MARYLAND DEMS OVERRIDE GOVERNOR'S VETO TO FUND ABORTION TRAINING, ALLOW NON-DOCTORS TO PERFORM ABORTIONS

Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., described Monday as a ""truly dark day in America.""

""A truly dark day in America with the news reports that the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" he wrote on Twitter. (It remains unclear whether the Court has indeed voted to overturn Roe, and the situation may change even if it has.) ""This year, I signed the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act – codifying a woman's right to choose into state law. New Jersey will not go backwards on reproductive rights.""

""I want to assure every New Jerseyan that today’s news about the Supreme Court does not change access to abortion in our state,"" he added.​ ""Access to reproductive health care remains available to anyone who needs it in New Jersey.""

Attorney General Phil Weiser, D-Colo., pledged to defend ""reproductive rights"" if the Court will not.

""Now would be a good time to make clear that Colorado will protect reproductive rights regardless of whether #SCOTUS does,"" he tweeted. ""And we will be protect the right to travel here for abortion services as well.""

States with Democratic legislatures have passed laws codifying abortion in case Roe gets overturned. Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo., signed a law creating a ""fundamental right"" to abortion and denying any right for the unborn. In 2019, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., signed a law codifying abortion rights and explicitly removing protections from unborn infants.

While many polls suggest Americans support Roe, in-depth polling reveals a more complicated picture. When asked about their opinion on abortion during specific periods of pregnancy and other situations, 71% of Americans say they support restricting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy (22%), or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest (28%), to save the life of the mother (9%) or not at all (12%). Only 17% of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12% said it should be restricted to the first six months.

Former President George W. Bush will appear at a fundraiser for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who has been targeted by former President Donald Trump following a breakdown of their relationship after his 2020 election loss.

The fundraiser will be held at the Texas home of real estate developer Harlan Crow, Politico reported. Bush is listed as a ""special guest,"" the report said.

Tickets for a V.I.P. reception are listed at $15,200, while the general reception is priced at $5,000.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN GEORGIA'S GOP CLASH FOR GOVERNOR

Kemp is a first-term conservative governor who’s facing a primary challenge from former GOP Sen. David Perdue, who is backed by Trump. Trump has called for Kemp to be ousted after the governor refused to help overturn his state's election results after claiming the contest was rigged.

Trump said Kemp had not pushed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hard enough to reverse then-President-elect Joe Biden's victory, The Washington Post reported.

Bush's appearance represents years of tension between the Trump and Bush families, according to Politico. Trump often insulted Bush before running for president and threw jabs during his 2016 bid at Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida.

Bush has largely refrained from criticizing Trump.

Perdue has struggled to tap the same network of big donors that sustained his two Senate runs, despite his endorsement by former President Donald Trump. After having less than $1 million in cash on hand at the end of January, Perdue hinted he would crack his own $50 million fortune to try to keep up with Kemp's spending.

An effort to counter illegal immigration in Texas will receive another $500 million in funding through the end of the year, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced last week.

The money will be redirected from state agencies to Operation Lone Star, which went into effect a year ago. The program is a joint mission between the National Guard soldiers and troopers with the state Department of Public Safety.

""Texas will not sit on the sidelines as President Biden continues turning a blind eye to the crisis at our southern border,"" Abbott said in a statement Friday. ""Texans’ safety and security is our top priority, and we will continue fighting to keep our communities safe.

Texas has been especially aggressive in trying to combat the surge of illegal crossings into the state, going so far as to bus apprehended migrants to Washington D.C., in what opponents have called a public relations stunt.

160,Australian man who insulted Chinese President Xi Jinping says police told him he will be charged,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

An Australian man who held up a sign displaying an insult against Chinese President Xi Jinping at a busy Asian market in Sydney said he's been told by authorities he could be charged over the incident even though he was reportedly attacked by Chinese nationalists.

Drew Pavlou was filmed holding the sign that read ""F*** Xi Jinping"" in Chinese on Saturday at the Eastwood Plaza. The signage quickly triggered an angry reaction from some shoppers, some of whom vented their frustration, according to footage of the incident on Pavlou's Twitter account.

.The video shows angry people confronting him.

""America has genocide,"" according to subtitles in a video of the incident.

WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

Another man snatches the sign and throws it to the ground. One said he was ""disrespecting Chinese here."" During the encounter, Pavlou tells the crowd he is non-violent.

He later tweeted that the New South Wales Police Force contacted him to inform him that detectives were investigating him and that he would likely be charged.

""NSW Police want to charge me for holding a sign insulting Xi Jinping while campaigning in Sydney,"" Lavlou wrote. ""They won’t even tell me what I’m being charged with. I’m sick of attacks on free speech, Australia desperately needs a Bill of Rights to protect free expression.""

He also tweeted about the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghur Muslims who have been rounded up and detained in camps.

A spokesperson for the police force declined to confirm that Pavlou was being investigated but said they were investigating an alleged assault that occurred during a political protest at the Eastwood Plaza.

""Following inquiries, investigators attended an Eastwood home and spoke with a 48-year-old man about 4.30pm today,"" a police statement said. ""He was issued a court attendance notice for Common Assault and is due to appear at Hornsby Local Court on Wednesday.""

In a tweet, Pavlou called threats of being charged an ""intimidation tactic.""

A small Utah-based nonprofit has been traveling to Ukraine refugee centers inside the war-torn country to deliver goods and necessities that haven't been addressed by larger organizations.

In order to try to live up to their commitments, Roberts, his former interpreter and a few others ""started doing what we could to help get people out and to get humanitarian aid in.""

""After retiring from the military I felt repurposed,"" he said.

When the war in Ukraine erupted, Roberts knew what the next mission was going to be.

Roberts said the general mission in Ukraine was to support refugees and displaced persons and provide humanitarian assistance.

Although the group wouldn't be able to feed a camp of a million refugees, Roberts knew they could ""get into a refugee camp in Ukraine, ask them what they need and then deliver it.""

""That's exactly what we're doing,"" he said. ""We're trying to be more surgical.""

""We went to Warsaw, we bought them,"" Roberts said. ""They were very grateful that somebody was asking them the question instead of just throwing resources at the problem.""

A 33-year-old artist diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes set out on a mission to walk 470 miles across three states this month.

Krista Sheneman's goal is to inspire other people who are also battling diabetes by showing them that the condition can't stop someone from being active or accomplishing their goals.

Sheneman was first diagnosed with diabetes around five years ago, and she says it was a wake-up call. Since then, Sheneman told Fox News Digital, health has become a huge part of her life.

BROOKLYN-BASED NONPROFIT DELIVERS 'BLANKETS OF HOPE' TO PEOPLE IN NEED

What she realized while battling this condition, though, is that a lot of people weren't aware of what she went through on a daily basis.

""Which is crazy to think [about] because there are so many diabetics out there,"" she said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 37 million Americans have diabetes and between 90%-95% of them have Type 2 diabetes.

So, Sheneman came up with an art project that would offer insight into what diabetics go through.

On April 1, she started her journey from her college town of Cincinnati, Ohio, and her plan is to make it to her hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, by the end of the month.

Throughout this journey, people will be able to watch her glucose levels through an app that's connected to her glucose monitor, the Dexcom G6. The monitor provides real-time alerts when her glucose levels fluctuate too high or low.

This journey is more than just showing people how physically difficult this walk is, she said.

""I want them to understand what it looks like to be diabetic and constantly checking and making sure that you're eating the right things,"" she said, adding that ""just something as simple as stress can raise your blood sugar.""

Sheneman was told by health professionals to do something simple, like walking, every day.

""They want you to kind of get out there and manage your health,"" she says.

To train for her walk, Sheneman spent eight hours a day on a treadmill while managing her diabetes with her glucose monitor.

""I think it's important to understand that it's not necessarily limiting you,"" she said. ""There's just the creative hump that you have to get over.""

167,MSNBC's Joy Reid and all critical race theory advocates owe our children an apology,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Critical race theory and its proponents have dominated American society for more than four years. From corporations to classrooms, it's everywhere and yet, those same proponents shout ‘racism’ when folks like myself have grave concerns over its effects on not just our nation, but our nation’s future: our children.

Functioning as more than a simple curriculum, CRT has resulted in the unfair treatment of underserved kids; brainwashing them to believe things like poor academic achievement and mediocracy is sufficient based on their ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Fundamentally, CRT is harming our nation’s youth through the promotion of segregation, the degradation of academic aptitude, and the denial of the American Dream.

BIDEN ADMIN WAS ‘ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING’ STATES TO USE COVID MONEY TO PUSH CRT, SAYS ONE NATION PRESIDENT

I have seen first-hand the results of CRT on some of our nation’s most vulnerable youth at my organization, the Jack Brewer Foundation. My kids—often from broken homes without fathers—are often told in school that their F’s are ""good"" because of their socioeconomic status and their race. These schools don’t address the deficiencies in math or struggles in reading—where some of these kids are at a reading level which is three to four grades behind—and yet they still are pushed through the school system. There is no extra programming or specialized training to even attempt to address their learning impairments.

No child, regardless of race, should receive a D or F on a report card and have a teacher insist that they have made satisfactory progress due to demographics. However, this is the residuals of critical race theory where your expected aptitude is based solely on your skin color.

Given the reality my kids are facing, you would expect the mission of the Jack Brewer Foundation to not only be uncontroversial but championed by Americans across the political spectrum and throughout the country. In fact, in early April, we were first invited by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to come down for the signing of a bill designed to help address the fatherhood crisis plaguing our nation. Two weeks later, Governor DeSantis invited us once again to for the signing of another bill designed to combat CRT in our nation’s schools.

While separate issues, these bills were designed to protect families and ensure our nation’s children were able to accomplish whatever their dreams may be. As the governor signed the bill, he was flanked by my kids who were the ultimate benefactors of such legislation.

However, sadly widespread support was not the case with Joy Reid. If you’re not familiar with Joy Reid, she’s a political anchor on MSNBC who took it upon herself to tweet that ""The [misuse] of Black boys is tantamount to child abuse. I would really like to hear the back-story on who these kids were and how they wound up at a DeSantis event. Given how anti-Black DeSantis is, using Black children this way is extra sick."" Upon seeing the tweet, we immediately secured our kids for their own safety and privacy as calls to locate them grew amongst the media and our attention turned to Joy Reid. Being present as Gov. DeSantis signed these bills meant the world to our kids, and now they are being forced to think of their governor—the same governor that stood by them—as some racist, anti-Black person after Joy Reid’s vile comments went viral.

Joy Reid talks about the ""misuse of Black boys"" and ""anti-Blackness,"" but doesn’t seem to have that same energy when young Black boys are being misused and degraded in the school system based on CRT—a theory that has her ringing endorsement. Furthermore, for her to sit there and accuse both me and the hardworking people who work at the Jack Brewer Foundation of ""child abuse"" for kids who volunteered to be at event with the governor of their state is beyond comprehension.

However, I can’t say I’m surprised by her actions. CRT is so vile that positive things like support of two-parent households or teaching our kids that their skin color does not determine their future are rejected. Instead of teaching our nation’s youth that the color of skin should not determine how they are viewed, CRT asks that we teach our Black kids that they are victims and tell our White kids that they are oppressors. Outside the classroom, we see the same thing in corporations, our nation’s military, and even banks. For example, woke banks are now closing accounts and refusing to serve entire industries they deem not woke enough. Companies like the GEO Group and even the oil gas industry are suffering because the left’s woke agenda knows no boundaries.

The left’s woke ideology must be stopped. What began in universities has infected every facet of American life and continues to strike at our future—our children—and if we do not fight back, we will lose our country. I will hold Joy Reid accountable, and she can soon expect legal action for putting my kids in danger. But ultimately, this is about an apology that’s due. I do not want any money from MSNBC nor Joy Reid, but rather closure for my kids given this entire situation.

168,Illinois school district offers curriculum for K-3 kids to 'break the binary' of gender,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Editor's note: The following column first appeared in City Journal.

The Evanston–Skokie School District has adopted a radical gender curriculum that teaches pre-kindergarten through third-grade students to celebrate the transgender flag, break the ""gender binary"" established by white ""colonizers,"" and experiment with neo-pronouns such as ""ze,"" ""zir,"" and ""tree.""

I have obtained the full curriculum documents, which are part of the Chicago-area district’s ""LGBTQ+ Equity Week,"" which administrators adopted last year. The curriculum begins in pre-kindergarten, with a series of lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The lesson plan opens with an introduction to the rainbow flag and teaches students that ""each color in the flag has a meaning."" The teacher also presents the transgender flag and the basic concepts of gender identity, explaining that ""we call people with more than one gender or no gender, non-binary or queer.""

RACHEL LEVINE SAYS PEDIATRICIANS ALL AGREE ON IMPORTANCE OF 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR CHILDREN

Finally, the lesson plan has the teacher leading a class project to create a rainbow flag, with instructions to ""gather students on the rug,"" ""ask them to show you their flags,"" and ""proudly hang the class flag where they can all see it.""

In kindergarten, the lessons on gender and trans identity go deeper. ""When we show whether we feel like a boy or a girl or some of each, we are expressing our gender identity,"" the lesson begins. ""There are also children who feel like a girl and a boy; or like neither a boy or a girl. We can call these children transgender."" Students are expected to be able to ""explain the importance of the rainbow flag and trans flag"" and are asked to consider their own gender identity.

The kindergartners read two books that affirm transgender conversions, study photographs of boys in dresses, learn details about the transgender flag, and perform a rainbow dance. At the end of the lesson, the students are encouraged to adopt and share their own gender identities with the class.

""Now you have a chance to make a picture to show how you identify,"" the lesson reads. ""Maybe you want to have blue hair! Maybe you want to be wearing a necklace. Your identity is for you to decide!""

REPORT: TEENS EXPRESSING REGRET OVER 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' ARE 'GOING UNHEARD' BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

In first grade, students learn about gender pronouns. The teachers explain that ""some pronouns are gender neutral"" and students can adopt pronouns such as ""she, tree, they, he, her, him, them, ze, zir, [and] hir."" The students practice reading a series of scripts in which they announce their gender pronouns and practice using alternate pronouns, including ""they,"" ""tree,"" ""ze,"" and ""zir.""

The teacher encourages students to experiment and reminds them: ""Whatever pronouns you pick today, you can always change."" Students then sit down to complete a ""pronouns workbook,"" with more lessons on neo-pronouns and non-binary identities.

In third grade, Evanston–Skokie students are told that white European ""colonizers"" imposed their ""Western and Christian ideological framework"" on racial minorities and ""forced two-spirit people to conform to the gender binary.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The teacher tells students that ""many people feel like they aren’t really a boy or a girl"" and that they should ""call people by the gender they have in their heart."" Students are encouraged to ""break the binary,"" reject the system of ""whiteness,"" and study photographs of black men in dresses and a man wearing lipstick and long earrings. ""It is a myth that gender is binary,"" the lesson explains. ""Even though we are all given a sex assigned at birth, you are not given your gender. Only you can know your gender and how you feel inside.""

At the end of the lesson, students are instructed to write a letter to the future on how they can change society. ""Society right now is very unfair,"" reads a sample letter. ""I see a lot of marches on the T.V. and I even went to a march last summer.""

The curriculum in the Evanston–Skokie School District is the perfect illustration of college-level Queer Theory translated into early-elementary pedagogy. For weeks, as the nation has debated Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act, which prohibits public schools from teaching gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K–3, commentators on the political left have claimed that public schools do not teach this material and have accused conservatives of instigating a ""moral panic.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

This claim is demonstrably false, and the Evanston–Skokie lesson plans offer additional proof for parents and legislators concerned about gender ideology in American public schools.

Queer Theory has made its way into public school curriculums for children as young as four. This development should be subject to robust political debate, not denial and dismissal from the political Left.

169,"Biden gives 'free' phones to illegal immigrants, hell-bent on doing away with detention","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

When I first heard that the Biden administration was giving free smartphones to illegal aliens who recently crossed the border, I was incensed. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I instantly knew why, and that is because the administration doesn't want to detain them.

The open borders advocates have access to the same data I do that can be found within the 2020 Department of Homeland Security Enforcement Lifecycle Report. They know that if aliens are detained and receive a final order of removal from an immigration judge, the aliens will be removed 98% of the time.

The same report also shows that unless a deportable alien is fully detained, 85% will not be removed from the U.S. Only 6% of family groups leave as ordered and about 3% of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) leave as ordered. And let’s remember, 72% of UACs are of the age 15-17.

29 GOP SENATORS JOIN JOHNSON, BIGGS IN RESOLUTION TO REPEAL BIDEN'S ASYLUM RULE

I have said for years that detention is a vital tool to ensure each alien gets due process and actually sees a judge and a court’s final decision can be carried out – whether it’s some sort of relief or an ordered departure. Many advocates and politicians insist these aliens have a right to claim asylum, and I agree. But if you believe that as a function of the legal system, then you also must stand by the decision of that legal process and respect it. Detention guarantees both.

However, this administration is attacking detention and Congress is limiting the funding for it. Under President Trump’s last full year there were more than 55,000 people in immigration detention and now there is about 25,000.

Next year's budget cuts funding from 34,000 beds to an even lower 25,000 beds. Many of the Democrat politicians want to end detention all together. Instead of detention, they want to focus on ""alternatives to detention.""

The most recent budget requests $527.1 million, an increase of $75 million, to expand those alternatives to detention monitoring programs. What ICE really needs is more technology, and they need to combine detention and all technology for effective enforcement to carry out its important mission.

We have done this in both Republican and Democrat administrations. We have never been able to get away from alternative programs and this administration is hell-bent of doing a lot more of it rather than detain.

This is where the phones come in. Here is what my research of these new phones has revealed. There are an estimated 10-12 million individuals with unresolved immigration cases in the United States. The number of people being monitored is only a small percentage awaiting an immigration hearing – approximately 213,000 individuals of the four million on the non-detained docket.

These devices/phones that are being utilized by ICE are supervision devices which allows for individuals who have been placed into removal proceedings to comply with the terms of their release.

To be clear, ICE does not issue free all-purpose phones to migrants. The devices only allow the individual to make a 911 call or contact the ICE officer assigned to their case as per the terms of their release. The supervision applications are pre-installed.

Officers assign the device to an alien, and power on the unit. Functionality is completely controlled by the Agency. Participants are unable to disable features or install third-party applications. In addition, there is no ability to browse the internet, make unauthorized phone calls, access app stores, manipulate the phone settings and send or receive text messages. The device also has GPS capability. This mobile monitoring app provides a secure platform for communication between the ICE officer and alien.

Now comes a tough choice. When you are dealing with an administration that controls Congress and the White House that is hell-bent on detaining fewer and fewer migrants, what’s the lesser of two evils? Release migrants with no oversight, no monitoring, no GPS capability; or do you try to monitor and track them to the best of your ability? They can certainly toss the device in a lake and disappear but data shows that most do not. Most people abscond after receiving a final order.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Here is why the monitoring is important. If the device maintains a good success rate like it has thus far, more aliens will be in court when they receive a final order of removal.

Orders that are issued ""in absentia"" (alien was not present at the time the judge makes a decision), are often appealed because the alien will claim he never received notice of the hearing and has a right to be heard which delays for years the final outcome. A device that will increase the likelihood that you show up to court to be served the decision usually removes that petty appeals process.

To be clear, I support detention. It’s the most successful way to ensure migrants received due process and ensures swift removal when a court orders it. ""Catch and release"" sends a bad message to the rest of the world to enter our country illegally, and you will be set free. That is why we ended it under the Trump administration.

Firefighters in Oregon rescued two people Saturday after a rollover crash in a remote area left them trapped inside their vehicle for hours, authorities said.

First responders got a call about a vehicle crash just before 5 a.m. in the rural area southwest of Timber, a community located about 40 miles northwest of Portland, Banks Fire District 13 said.

The caller said the vehicle had gone off the road and over an embankment but could not provide the exact location.

Fire officials said that minimal phone service in the remote area prevented first responders from immediately learning the exact location of the vehicle.

""Neither of the phones were able to hit more than one tower, which is necessary to give a good triangulation,"" the fire district said. ""The best location we had from the phones was what tower they were hitting, and in the coast range that can be very misleading.""

Rescuers tried to narrow down the search area using a variety of methods, including alternating sirens and listening for the caller honking a vehicle’s horn, the fire district said.

About two hours after receiving the call, fire officials said rescuers met a hiker in the area who directed them to the crash site. First responders then spotted the vehicle, which had flipped over an embankment and onto its roof.

171,Nebraska teen accepted to all five military academies sets out to serve America,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

High school senior Noble Rasmussen intends to serve his country well — and all five U.S. military academies seem to agree.

The Nebraska teen joined ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday to celebrate his acceptance to all five academies.

He then announced on the program that he’ll be attending the United States Air Force Academy in June.

Rasmussen, a cadet with the Civil Air Patrol, said that his interest in applying to each school was sparked from a desire to represent and serve the United States as a whole.

""I want to serve my country the best I can,"" he said.

""So applying to all academies [presented] the option to serve anywhere.""

""I feel like it’s my duty to serve my country.""

While the ""noble"" sentiment of military service complements Rasmussen’s first name nicely, his mother, Cheri Rasmussen, said that was his parents' exact intention when they named him.

""Our prayer for him his whole life was just to have that noble character of honor, honesty and integrity,"" she said. ""Just to kind of rise above and have that high moral principle.""

""God has blessed us with that, and we see those qualities of leadership and maturity in Noble.""

""I feel like it’s my duty to serve my country."" — Noble Rasmussen

Noble Rasmussen’s father, Kirk Rasmussen, shared that he and his wife were ""really amazed"" upon their son’s acceptances — as well as his receiving of multiple nominations from members of Congress.

The young patriot advised other teens who may be interested in attending military academies as well to take academics, athletics and leadership opportunities in high school ""a moment at a time"" while building relationships along the way.

172,Navy veteran in Texas sheds 70 pounds: 'My health was declining',"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In the face of mounting health complications, one Navy veteran decided to make a major lifestyle change.

It meant overhauling his eating habits — which led him to shed 70 pounds within five months.

Rob Reid, 50, of Axtell, Texas, enlisted in the Navy in 1990, serving until his retirement in October 2021.

Reid was struggling to maintain the ""very rigorous fitness standards"" of the Navy.

Reid told Fox News Digital that before he retired, he and his wife, Michelle, were inspired to improve their overall health and well-being.

FORMER ‘JEOPARDY!’ WINNER SHEDS 200 POUNDS: ‘I WAS ABLE TO STICK WITH IT’

At the time, Reid said his weight skyrocketed to the heaviest he'd ever been. He was dealing with high blood pressure, a respiratory condition and cholesterol issues.

In addition, Reid struggled to maintain the ""very rigorous fitness standards"" of the Navy.

Reid said he was also ""controlled by food"" at the time — and eventually reached a weight of 228 pounds.

""I knew I needed to do something,"" Reid told Fox News Digital.

‘If I saw food, I wanted to eat it'

Reid's desire to improve his health was the driving factor in his weight loss.

""My health was already declining, and my wife was in fear that her health would decline,"" said Reid.

One of the biggest changes he made, he said, was adjusting his mindset about food.

""I didn’t have any structure when it came to foods,"" Reid said, adding, ""If I saw food, I wanted to eat it.""

He said that once he joined WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers, he learned how to ""manage that craving, and it helped me manage the foods that I was consuming.""

""My health was my driving factor. My health was already declining, and my wife was in fear that her health would decline.""

It helped that there were ""no foods [that were] off-limits"" and that Reid and his wife were able to make — and achieve — small goals as they went along.

""We immediately started losing the weight,"" Reid said.

""We immediately started feeling much better,"" he also said. ""So those small goals — they transitioned to huge victories and huge successes.""

Reid said those wins gave him and his wife the ability to stay focused on their long-term goals even when things were tough.

""The mindset shifted,"" Reid said.

""And because of that mindset shift, we were able to stay within our goals.""

Cheerleaders for one another

Reid said that working on his weight loss with his wife also joining in the battle was a key part of his success.

""Having my wife join the program with me has made it significantly more executable for me,"" Reid said. ""It’s an amazing support structure.""

""We’re each other’s cheerleader,"" he added. ""[It’s been] very special with her being in the program with me.""

Together, Reid and his wife lost a combined 100 pounds.

Reid reached his target weight of 158 pounds by December of last year, just five months into their health journey.

""In my 50s, I am currently, right now, at my high school weight … [Earlier,] I was the heaviest I had ever been in my life.""

Since then, Reid has been able to keep off the weight successfully and ""comfortably,"" he said.

""I still eat the foods I enjoy,"" Reid said.

Reid said he’s also active — and that he and Michelle go on regular walks together.

""In my 50s, I am currently, right now, at my high school weight,"" Reid said.

""I would have never envisioned, at my age, that I would have been able to lose 70 pounds,"" he added.

A Florida sheriff’s office has released dramatic body camera video showing a heroic deputy climb a three-story apartment building to rescue a baby during a fire.

Orange County Sheriff’s deputies responded early Saturday morning to the Isles at East Millenia apartments in Orlando after part of the complex caught fire, the sheriff’s office said.

174,Rob Lowe’s brother Chad Lowe on how the pair have stayed grounded in Hollywood: ‘The foundation is family’,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

For the first time in his decades-long career, Chad Lowe will appear on-screen alongside his brother, Rob Lowe.

The 54-year-old will guest star in Monday’s episode of ""9-1-1: Lone Star"" in which firefighter Capt. Owen Strand [Rob] returns to Los Angeles and is faced with ""painful childhood memories."" Robert Pine, star of ‘70s cop show ""CHiPs"" and father of actor Chris Pine, will play their dad.

Lowe previously directed two episodes of the FOX drama, which has a close connection to his family. Lowe’s nephew, John Owen Lowe, is also a writer for the series.

Lowe spoke to Fox News Digital about what compelled him to finally appear on-screen, what it was like growing up with Rob, 58, and what has kept the family grounded in Hollywood.

‘PRETTY IN PINK’ STAR ANDREW MCCARTHY ON BRAT PACK FAME, FACING ALCOHOL ABUSE: ‘IT WAS SO ALL-CONSUMING’

Fox News: You previously directed two episodes of ""9-1-1: Lone Star."" What compelled you to guest star now?

Chad Lowe: I got a phone call from the writer and one of the creators, Tim Minear. I expected the phone call was going to be about an episode I was going to direct. But he goes, ""Hey, this is not about directing. Are you interested in acting?"" I said, ""I’m always interested – yes."" And he goes, ""OK, I’ve got something for you."" I am such a fan of Tim’s work and admire him so much that I said ""yes"" before I even knew what exactly he was proposing.

Then he said, ""You’re going to play Rob’s brother."" It was great. And then I realized this is the first time Rob and I will get to be in anything together. First time we’ve ever acted together. For all of these years, many people have asked why we haven’t done it sooner, or when we are going to do it. Rob and I have both wondered ourselves why we’ve never been in anything together.

Here it is, here’s that opportunity. I was thrilled and excited about playing this character. And when I read it, I was even more thrilled. It’s a lot of dialogue… I’ve been primarily directing. So my biggest worry was, ""Am I going to remember my lines?"" You always have that fear as an actor, that you’re not going to remember your lines. It terrifies every actor. And it happens to the best of us. But for me, I was on a show that I’ve already worked on as a director.

I did not want to fail. And I especially didn’t want to fail in front of my brother. Because I would hear about it for the rest of our lives *laughs*. But it was a little bit like riding a bicycle. And it didn’t hurt that I was with my brother. Rob is just a really talented actor. He really brings the best out of me.

Fox News: What was it like to finally work alongside your brother?

Lowe: It was an incredible experience. We were able to bring our history – a lifetime of history – to these scenes and these moments that we shared on screen. There were so much unspoken [words] going on, and yet there’s the dialogue that we’re speaking. And there’s also this other life that we had, life experiences that we were able to bring. I think it’s just evident and it makes [the scenes] that much richer.

Fox News: This show is a family affair because your nephew also writes for it.

Lowe: John Owen is a writer on the show. I’ve had the pleasure of directing an episode that he wrote. So it truly was a family affair. We had Rob as the star, I was directing and John had written the episode. It was such a real thrill to have that opportunity.

Fox News: What’s it been like for you to watch your nephew find his footing in the TV and film industry?

Lowe: He’s very smart, he’s very sharp. I’ve always known that whatever he applied himself toward he would succeed because he’s really one of the smartest people I know. I often turn to John Owen for advice on anything current, be it fashion or social media skills *laughs*. He’s an expert on everything. He’s so well beyond his years… It’s not surprising to see him excel at all. I’m just an uncle, but I do have a real sense of pride watching him and all of his accomplishments.

Fox News: As a family in the film and television industry, what do you think has kept all of you grounded?

Lowe: Some might argue that we’re not grounded – we are in Hollywood after all *laughs*. But I think it’s always about family first. All the other stuff is on top of family. The foundation is family. The foundation is the love that we share for one another and each other. The most important thing is that bond. Everything else grows from that bond of family. That’s always been the most important thing to us. And I think it helps to have kids of my own. It’s very humbling and it keeps me grounded. There’s nothing more grounding than having your kids call you out.

John Owen has famously called Rob out. I enjoy watching that dynamic play out on social media as much as anybody else. As soon as Rob posts something, I can’t wait to hear what John Owen’s take on it is going to be *laughs*. I have a similar dynamic with my kids, although they’re much younger. I have three daughters and my oldest is turning 13. I have a 9-year-old and a 6-year-old. They’re my life. Literally, they’re the most important things in my life. I feel really blessed and fortunate that’s the primary focus of my life. It really does put perspective into everything that I do.

Fox News: What’s your favorite childhood memory involving your brother?

Lowe: Oh my – I have so many. I couldn’t pick just one because I literally have a lifetime full of them… We would spend our summers together in Ohio with our father. And so our father would have to work during the day. We were just these two latchkey kids in Dayton, Ohio, in the summers, kind of running amok and getting into all sorts of trouble. We were like Butch and Sundance. We were connected to the hip with everything that we did our entire childhood. We have so many shared experiences. We have songs – I can mention a song title to him and it immediately brings us back to an incident that occurred, a shared experience.

I really couldn’t just pick one because there are literally so many of them. I just said literally just like Rob [in his podcast]. I think he stole it literally from me *laughs*… We’re very competitive. We grew up very competitive with one another. We’ve had our battles like all siblings do. But he’s always been my best friend. And I think he would say the same of me. He’s the person that I turn to for almost everything in my life. Aside from my wife and my kids, it’s him.

Fox News: What do you believe has been the secret behind the success of ""9-1-1: Lone Star""?

Lowe: I think the secret sauce is just how much story it’s able to pack into a single episode that runs the gauntlet of human emotions. From the drama, the sadness, the conflict, the humor and then the action. It’s all of those ingredients in one episode. As a director, you could be directing something humorous and light-hearted, and then the very next scene, it’s incredibly emotional as it deals with life and death. And then the very next day, you’re going into this incredible location where a tragedy or rescue is happening in a building that’s on fire.

GINA TORRES JOINING ‘9-1-1: LONE STAR’ AS SERIES REGULAR

Those set pieces are always so big and dynamic. Visually, it’s incredible to look at. But it’s also about these really drawn-out characters. I’ve always said that explosions and action are great to watch, but if you don’t care about the characters, there are no stakes. What I think they’ve done so well with ""Lone Star"" is they’ve created these characters that are so diverse, come from such different backgrounds, and yet they come together and are united, usually by a single cause. You’re rooting for them and you’re invested in them. You’re invested in their well-being and the outcome of what will inevitably be a huge event. Your heart is right there with them when they’re in rescue mode.

Fox News: When do you feel most like yourself, in front of the camera or working behind it?

Lowe: I love getting the opportunity to do both, act and direct. If I can do both, it’s a perfect balance because I think each satisfies certain and different parts of who I am. I think directing is where I feel most authentic and most challenged, whereas acting feels more insular and… more vulnerable. You’re oftentimes showing parts of yourself that you don’t normally present publicly.

Fox News: What do you hope audiences will get from this episode featuring you and your brother?

Lowe: Well, it’s the first time we’ve ever been on-screen, which I’m excited to see if I watch it. I sometimes find it hard to watch myself. But I think this episode scratches deeper into the surface of what makes [Rob’s character] Owen frantic. He’s going to confront past issues that present themselves. It’s kind of an origin story. And also, it’s cathartic for him. I know Rob was really thrilled because he got to surf *laughs*. I haven’t seen the whole episode yet, but I saw some of the sequences and they’re beautiful. We get to see another side of Owen Strand, a more vulnerable side of him.

175,Johnny Depp’s daughter Lily-Rose Depp: What to know,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Lily-Rose Depp, a 22-year-old Hollywood starlet and Chanel billboard queen, has been mentioned several times while various witnesses testify in her father Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard.

Depp sued Heard — whom he was romantically linked to from 2012 until 2016 — after the actress wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post detailing alleged abuse. Although Heard didn't name Depp in the op-ed, she detailed allegations of abuse that allegedly occurred in 2016 when she was married to Depp.

During Tuesday's testimony, a story about Depp and Heard's time on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star's private island that included Lily-Rose took center stage.

Tara Roberts, the manager of Depp's private island, testified via video and recalled that she arranged for transportation to take Lily-Rose, who was around 13 years old at the time, and Heard off the island after the actor passed out drunk in the sand in front of the children. The two were accompanied by a friend of Heard's, Roberts said.

7 CRAZY CELEBRITY MOTHER-DAUGHTER LOOKALIKES

Depp is also father to a son, Jack. Jack was around 11 at the time. Roberts testified that Jack remained while Lily-Rose left.

The incident apparently occurred in the summer of 2013.

Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, asked Roberts if she remembers Lily-Rose being ""upset because her father was drinking and trying to hide it from"" her. Depp's lawyer objected, and Roberts didn't have to respond.

Prior to that, Lily-Rose was mentioned when Depp himself was testifying, saying that Lily-Rose did not attend his 2015 wedding to Heard. ""My daughter Lily-Rose did not come to the wedding. She and Ms. Heard were not on particularly great terms for several reasons,"" he testified.

So, who is Lily-Rose Depp?

Hollywood royalty

Lily-Rose is the daughter of Depp and his ex, Vanessa Paradis. The two first began dating in 1998 after meeting in Paris while Depp was filming ""The Ninth Gate.""

Depp and Paradis never got married despite spending nearly 14 years together.

""I love the romance of ‘Let’s get married,’ but then, when you have it so perfect … I mean, I’m more married than anybody can be – we have two kids. Maybe one day, but it’s something I can really do without,"" Paradis once told Elle magazine.

The pair split in 2012.

The American Family Association is pushing back against a recent instance of what it is calling ""corporate cultural indoctrination.""

In a statement on Monday, the AFA, based in Tupelo, Mississippi, reacted to news of Apple's iPhone emojis for IOS 15.4.

The latest emojis include one for a ""third gender"" — as well as one representing a ""pregnant man."" The ""third gender"" image shows the face of a seemingly ""neutral"" person wearing a crown.

""Companies [are] creating a stir as they promote gender confusion through their products.""

""Apple also rolled out more than 100 innocuous emojis such as new smiley faces,"" the AFA said, in part, in its media statement.

""Through this seemingly casual introduction of ‘woke’ emojis, Apple joins the ranks of corporate giants such as Disney and Netflix in the list of companies creating a stir as they promote gender confusion through their products.""

AFA’s Ed Vitagliano, executive vice president — speaking of Apple’s latest update — said that in his view, the new ""woke"" emojis foster ""even more confusion for those who might already be struggling with their identities.""

""We can all hope that the lunacy being exhibited by corporate America in its thirst for woke approval will one day be rejected,"" he said, ""by the vast majority of people in this country.""

He added, ""This woke pandering is also quite sad, as there really are people who are struggling with their identity and feel lost.""

""The answer isn’t to encourage them to continue wandering aimlessly in the darkness of their delusion, because that will only prolong their suffering,"" he said.

""The answer is the gospel and the love of God,"" said Vitagliano. ""That is the light that will help the lost find their way home and find the peace they desire.""

""The pregnant man and pregnant person recognize that ‘pregnancy is possible for some transgender men and non-binary people,’"" Emojipedia, a voting member of the Unicode Consortium, said of the move.

The American Family Association (afa.net) is a nonprofit 501c3 group; it was founded in 1977 and said it ""has long been on the front lines of America’s culture war.""

""The pregnant man and pregnant person recognize that ‘pregnancy is possible for some transgender men and non-binary people,’"" Emojipedia, a voting member of the Unicode Consortium — which approves all emojis used in smartphones — said about the move, as FOX Business previously reported.

Also, a blog post from the Emojipedia blog noted, ""As new human emojis have been released, Unicode has made an effort to be inclusive with gender, especially in recent years. The approach has varied depending on the situation, though the general goal is to standardize inconsistencies in legacy decisions.""

In a recent opinion piece about the pregnant man emoji and what it signifies, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce wrote, ""The ‘pregnant man’ does not exist. There are biological women who identify as men but still have their reproductive systems intact and, voila, are capable of getting pregnant. Recognizing that is not transphobia, and it also shouldn’t be ‘news.’ It’s a fact,"" she said.

""But,"" Bruce also said in part, ""that doesn’t get you a headline or a way to continue to try to pit Americans against each other …""

She was sharing her views, she noted in her piece, ""as a gay woman and former liberal community organizer in the 1990s.""

She also wrote, ""Men can’t get pregnant. And everyone knows it. To say otherwise is also an insult to transsexuals who continue to be used like chess pieces by partisan political operatives as their lives are objectified and sensationalized.""

Anna Wintour is once again the Met Gala's honorary co-chair.

The Vogue editor-in-chief, 72 — whose life as an enigmatic fashion icon was recently chronicled in a new book, ""Anna: The Biography"" — has been at the decision-making helm of the magazine since 1988. She's also co-chaired the Met Gala for many years. The first time-ever was in 1995.

Known for her signature bob cut and dark sunglasses, the British-born journalist’s career has made for countless articles tracking her rise to one of the most prominent positions in the fashion editorial world since she began forging her way atop the totem pole in London back in the 1960s.

Here's what to know about Anna Wintour:

ANNA WINTOUR, HUSBAND SHELBY RYAN PRIVATELY SPLIT YEARS AGO: REPORTS

Early life

Anna Wintour’s life early on was derived from a literary background as her father, Charles Wintour, made his bones as the editor of the London ""Evening Standard,"" a position he held from 1959 to 1976.

Meanwhile, Wintour’s brother, Patrick is the diplomatic editor for The Guardian. She has credited Patrick with learning the methods of being a ""great reporter.""

Wintour quickly climbed the ranks of fashion journalism after stops at New York Magazine and House and Garden before she landed the role of editor at British Vogue — which she held from 1985 to 1987 before taking over the Vogue imprint entirely.

She also had previous stints at Viva and Savvy — as well as Harper’s & Queen, where she worked as an editorial assistant. Wintour then jumped to Harper's Bazaar, where she worked as a junior fashion editor.

Successful career and a multi-million dollar net worth

These days, Wintour is estimated to be worth around $35 million.

She is also said to have the final say on anything printed in Vogue. In 1989, Wintour reshaped the future of high-fashion magazine covers when Vogue released its May issue that featured the controversial Madonna as its main draw. It was the first time that any celebrity had graced the coveted cover.

As artistic director at its publisher Condé Nast, the most specific details of the famed Met Gala, which takes place every year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in collaboration with the museum’s Costume Institute on the first Monday in May, is decided by Wintour.

Wintour reportedly has the ultimate sign-off over the event's high-profile guest list and seating chart.

May 2's Met Gala is the second part of ""In America: An Anthology of Fashion"" — this year's sub-theme is ""Guilded Glamour.""

Mistakes made: ‘I take full responsibility’

Wintour has a reputation for being equal parts demanding and controversial, not only for her penchant to don precious furs, but also due to allegations of racial inequality within the scope of Condé Nast, which Wintour acknowledged in an open letter to her employees in June 2020.

In an emotional note to staff at the time, Wintour wrote: ""I want to start by acknowledging your feelings and expressing my empathy towards what so many of you are going through: sadness, hurt, and anger too.

""I want to say this especially to the Black members of our team — I can only imagine what these days have been like. But I also know that the hurt, and violence, and injustice we’re seeing and talking about have been around for a long time. Recognizing it and doing something about it is overdue.""

""I want to say plainly that I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators. We have made mistakes too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant. I take full responsibility for those mistakes.""

Added Wintour: ""It can’t be easy to be a Black employee at Vogue, and there are too few of you.

I am listening and would like to hear your feedback and your advice if you would like to share either.

""I am proud of the content we have published on our site over these past few days but I also know that there is much more work to do. Please don’t hesitate to be in touch with me directly. I am arranging ways we can discuss these issues together candidly, but in the meantime, I welcome your thoughts or reactions.""

The Kardashian-Jenner family members have won in the defamation lawsuit brought against them by Blac Chyna.

Following the news on Monday, Michael Rhodes and Michelle Doolin, trial counsel for the famous family issued a statement.

""On behalf of Kris, Kim, Khloe, and Kylie, I want to express our appreciation to the jury,"" the statement obtained by Fox News Digital read.

It continued: ""We are also grateful for the steady hand of Judge Alarcon in making sure that this was a fair trial. The jury sent a clear message to Ms. White and her lawyer -- I hope they are listening. Justice has prevailed.""

LOS ANGELES JUDGE THROWS OUT DEFAMATION PORTION OF BLAC CHYNA'S LAWSUIT AGAINST KIM KARDASHIAN

The Los Angeles jury found that none of the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family defamed Chyna, nor did any interfere with her contract by convincing the E! network to cancel her reality show ""Rob & Chyna.""

""Rob & Chyna"" starred Chyna and her then-fiancé Rob Kardashian. It aired for one season in 2016.

The four Kardashian defendants attended nearly the entire trial, and they all also testified, but when the verdict was read all were in New York at the Met Gala, where this year’s theme was ""Gilded Glamour.""

Chyna was in court for the verdict. She had no visible reaction.

After about 10 hours of deliberations, the jurors found on the long jury form that the Kardashians often acted in bad faith on the issues brought up in the case, but that it had no substantial effect on Chyna's contract or the fate of the show.

Chyna, who shares a 5-year-old daughter with Rob Kardashian, was awarded no damages.

Executives from the E! network, which aired the show, testified that ""Rob & Chyna"" ended because the relationship ended, not because of the defendants' actions.

Jurors were considering the defamation case against Kris Jenner, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, after a judge threw out the part of the lawsuit against Kim Kardashian in the middle of deliberations.

The trial focused largely on allegations that Chyna violently attacked her then-fiancé and reality TV co-star Rob Kardashian on a night and morning in December 2016.

He testified that she twice held a gun to his head, wrapped a phone-charging cord around his neck and beat him with a metal rod. She testified that she had put the cord around his neck and held the gun playfully as the two celebrated the renewal of their reality show, and when the celebration turned into a dispute, she was never violent against him.

JOHNNY DEPP V. AMBER HEARD DEFAMATION TRIAL: LIVE UPDATES

It was Friday’s episode of ""The Drew Barrymore Show"" that the ""Charlie’s Angels"" actress and actor Anthony Anderson were engaging in a time-filling back-and-forth about the viral trial.

Jennifer Grey admitted Johnny Depp was ""crazy jealous and paranoid"" throughout their one-year relationship.

The ""Dirty Dancing"" actress opened up about her relationship with Depp in her upcoming memoir, ""Out of the Corner."" Depp and Grey first met in 1989 after being set up on a blind date by the actress' agent.

""We ate, talked, drank Jack Daniel’s, laughed our asses off, took cigarette breaks midcourse. He was so ridiculously beautiful. And surprisingly open, funny, quirky and sweet,"" Grey wrote, according to an excerpt obtained by the Independent.

When Depp, who is currently involved in a defamation trial after ex-wife Amber Heard seemingly accused him of domestic violence, would return home to Grey, he would be ""crazy jealous and paranoid,"" according to the actress.

Seth Jarvis and Nino Niederreiter scored second-period goals and Antti Raanta was strong in net to help the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Boston Bruins 5-1 on Monday night in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series.

Raanta had 35 saves in his first career postseason start with No. 1 goaltender Frederik Andersen sidelined by injury. He held up against Boston's game-opening surge to keep Carolina in it before Jarvis and Niederreiter scored roughly two minutes apart in the second period to break a scoreless tie.

Carolina never surrendered that lead. Teuvo Teravainen and Vincent Trocheck added third-period goals, which helped Carolina maintain control and then stretch out a lead in this best-of-seven series opener.

Andrei Svechnikov punctuated the win with an empty-net goal at 17:59, capping what turned into a dominating third period against a team that has twice ousted Carolina from the playoffs in recent years.

Taylor Hall scored for Boston early in the third, beating Raanta between the circles after a feed from Erik Haula from a tussle behind the net. He almost tied the game minutes later when he pinged the left post. But those were the only real mistakes for Raanta, who made the routine glove stops along with the more impressive diving saves or post-to-post slides.

The Hurricanes won the Metropolitan Division, marking the second straight season they won a division title. And they have gone from having a nine-year playoff drought to reaching the postseason for the fourth straight season, the first time that had happened since the former Hartford Whalers relocated to North Carolina in 1997.

But the first two of those runs ended against the Bruins, first in a four-game sweep in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2019 followed by a five-game loss in the first round of the Toronto bubble a year later.

This time, they’re starting with a series lead.

Linus Ullmark finished with 20 saves for the Bruins, who have lost all four matchups with Carolina this year by a combined score of 21-2.

Tyler Herro scored 25 points, Bam Adebayo finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds, and the Miami Heat topped the shorthanded Philadelphia 76ers 106-92 on Monday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.

Jimmy Butler added 15 points for the top-seeded Heat, who got 10 from Gabe Vincent and P.J. Tucker.

The 76ers were without Joel Embiid, the MVP finalist who isn’t even in Miami while recovering from an orbital fracture and concussion — injuries suffered in Philadelphia’s first-round-clinching win at Toronto. He’s not expected to play in Game 2.

And as would be expected, he was missed. Tobias Harris scored 27 points for Philadelphia, which got 19 from Tyrese Maxey and 16 points, nine rebounds and five assists from James Harden.

Game 2 is Wednesday in Miami.

Miami came out as aggressive as could be, putting Tucker on Harden and having him guard him the entire 94 feet of the floor in a similar approach to what the Heat utilized against Atlanta’s Trae Young in the first round series.

It worked — for a while. Miami led by as many as 12 in the opening quarter, then a 10-2 run fueled by eight points from Herro gave the Heat a 13-point edge at 37-24 to mark their biggest of the half. The margin was still 46-36 midway through the second after another Herro basket.

The rest of the half was all Philly.

Miami went 1 for 9 from the field over the final 6 minutes of the half, with four turnovers in there as well, and Philadelphia went on a 15-4 spurt. Harden’s shot in the lane with 28 seconds left put the 76ers up 51-50, their first lead of the night and the score that they took into the locker room.

The 76ers scored the first four points of the second half, going up by five. That was as good as it got for the 76ers.

Adebayo took a bullet pass from Tucker for a dunk that put Miami up 62-61, and that would be the final lead change of the night. It was the start of a 10-0 run that built a cushion, and then an 13-2 run early in the fourth decided matters and pushed the Heat edge out to 98-77.

TIP-INS

76ers: Philadelphia fell to 6-9 without Embiid this season. ... DeAndre Jordan started in place of Embiid and had four points and two rebounds in 17 minutes. ... Georges Niang was 0 for 7, all those shots from 3-point range.

Heat: Kyle Lowry (hamstring) missed his third consecutive game. ... Backup center Dewayne Dedmon picked up three fouls in a 23-second span of the first quarter. He then had two more in a 1:46 span of the third, giving him five fouls in 4:14 of playing time.

CLANK

The teams combined to shoot 7 for 33 in the first half from 3-point range — 3 for 17 by the 76ers, 4 for 16 by the Heat.

ROBINSON SITS

Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who led Miami in games played for a third consecutive regular season, didn’t appear in Game 1. It’s the first time since April 2019 that he dressed but didn’t play, ending a streak of 256 games including playoffs. He missed three games this season while on Miami’s inactive list.

The NFL said Monday it found no evidence the Cleveland Browns incentivized former head coach Hue Jackson to lose games during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

Former U.S. Attorney and SEC Chair Mary Jo White and lawyers from the Debevoise firm determined none of the allegations Jackson made over the last couple of months have been substantiated. The NFL said the lawyers were ""unable"" to speak with Jackson directly.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

""The investigation found no evidence to suggest that the Browns' Four-Year Plan or the club's ownership or football personnel sought to lose or incentivized losses and made no decisions deliberately to weaken the team to secure a more favorable draft position,"" the league said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

""The comprehensive review included the full cooperation of the Browns and interviews with Jimmy Haslam and current and former members of the organization. While Coach Jackson initially agreed to meet with the investigators, he ultimately did not do so.

""Although unable to speak directly to Coach Jackson, the Debevoise team had access to his public statements and to his filings and testimony in a prior arbitration proceeding. The club also produced thousands of pages of documents, including emails, texts, internal memos and presentation decks as well as other material relating to club operations and the filings and testimony in the arbitration proceeding between the club and Coach Jackson.""

In February, following Brian Flores’ racial discrimination lawsuit against the NFL and three other teams, Jackson indicated on social media that the Browns paid bonuses for team losses and that he was set up to fail.

STEELERS' CHASE CLAYPOOL UNCONCERNED ABOUT WHO QB1 WILL BE: 'WE’RE GOING TO BE PRETTY GOOD'

Jackson was 3-36-1 overall before being fired during the 2018 season. Cleveland was 1-15 in 2016 and 0-16 in 2017.

Jackson first made the claims on Twitter. He wrote Haslam was ""was happy while we kept losing,"" and while it may not have been $100,000 he was offered to lose, Jackson assured followers, ""Trust me it was a good number.""

Kimberly Diemert, the executive director of the Hue Jackson Foundation, said it had records to help Flores.

""Fighting for what is right for everybody is what matters most,"" Diemert tweeted. ""Both of these men have been fighting the right fight. People who know the facts know the fight. To win the war you must be strategic.""

Jackson, who is now the head coach at Grambling State University, told ESPN in February there was money to be made for hitting certain milestones, like attaining a certain number of draft picks and being the youngest team in the league.

""Teams that win are just not the youngest team, not that the youngest teams can't win, so I didn't understand the process. I didn't understand what the plan was, I asked for clarity because it did not talk about winning and losing until year three and four. So that told you right there that something wasn't correct, but I still couldn't understand it until I had the team that I had,"" he told the outlet during an appearance on ""SportsCenter.""

There’s no speaking part about Griner specifically, but her detention in Russia is weighing heavily on the organization and the league as the season gets set to tip-off on Friday. The Mercury will play the Las Vegas Aces at home.

Sophie Cunningham was among those who talked about the star center being absent from the team last month.

BRITTNEY GRINER'S DETENTION WEIGHS HEAVILY ON TEAMMATES AS SEASON APPROACHES: 'WE MISS HER LIKE CRAZY'

""We’ve just got to keep praying for her,"" Cunningham said Monday. ""We hope she’s well. That’s all we know, you guys know as much as we do. No one wants to be in her situation. We miss her like crazy.""

Cunningham emphasized she was worried for Griner as a human being, not about how her absence will affect the team going forward.

""It’s BG, there’s no one like her in the whole world. We definitely miss her, but it’s not even about basketball anymore. We just want her to be well as a human being. She has a big stage, a lot of people know her, so we want her to be on the court,"" she added. ""Everyone who loves her just wants her to be home safe.""

187,Student loan refinance rates: 5-year variable-rate loans fall for third straight week,"Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as ""Credible"" below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Rates for well-qualified borrowers using the Credible marketplace to refinance student loans are trending up for 10-year fixed-rate loans, while 5-year variable rates are down.

For borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender during the week of Apr. 25, 2022:

Rates on 10-year fixed-rate refinance loans averaged 4.59%, up from 4.57% the week before and 3.69% a year ago. Rates for this term hit their lowest point of 2021 during the week of Nov. 22, when they were at 3.35%.

Rates on 5-year variable-rate refinance loans averaged 3.17%, down from 3.31% the week before and 3.20% a year ago. Rates for this term hit their lowest point of 2021 during the week of Nov. 22, when they were at 2.41%.

Student loan refinancing weekly rate trends

If you're curious about what kind of student loan refinance rates you may qualify for, you can use an online tool like Credible to compare options from different private lenders. Checking your rates won't affect your credit score.

Current student loan refinancing rates by FICO score

To provide relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest and payments on federal student loans have been suspended through at least Aug. 31, 2022. As long as that relief is in place, there’s little incentive to refinance federal student loans . But many borrowers with private student loans are taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to refinance their education debt at lower rates.

If you qualify to refinance your student loans, the interest rate you may be offered can depend on factors like your FICO score, the type of loan you’re seeking (fixed or variable rate) and the loan repayment term.

The chart above shows that good credit can help you get a lower rate and that rates tend to be higher on loans with fixed interest rates and longer repayment terms. Because each lender has its own method of evaluating borrowers, it’s a good idea to request rates from multiple lenders so you can compare your options. A student loan refinancing calculator can help you estimate how much you might save.

If you want to refinance with bad credit , you may need to apply with a cosigner. Or, you can work on improving your credit before applying. Many lenders will allow children to refinance parent PLUS loans in their own name after graduation.

You can use Credible to compare rates from multiple private lenders at once without affecting your credit score.

How rates for student loan refinancing are determined

The rates private lenders charge to refinance student loans depend in part on the economy and interest rate environment, but also the loan term, the type of loan (fixed- or variable-rate), the borrower's creditworthiness and the lender's operating costs and profit margin.

188,Erasing student loan debt could disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans,"President Biden has revived the possibility of erasing some student loan debt for millions of Americans, a policy that could disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans.

Biden, who is facing mounting pressure from progressives as well as declining approval ratings, floated the possibility last week of eliminating $10,000 in debt per borrower, likely through executive action.

BIDEN CANCELING STUDENT DEBT WOULD MAKE INFLATION WORSE, EXPERTS WARN

""I am considering dealing with some debt reduction,"" Biden said Thursday in response to a question at the White House. ""I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction. But I'm in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness.""

But a recent working paper published by the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute for Economics shows that erasing all student loan debt would distribute about $192 billion to the top 20% of earners in the U.S., and just $29 billion to the bottom 20% of U.S. households. That unequal distribution would likely be mirrored under a plan in which just $10,000 in debt is canceled.

Under a universal loan forgiveness program, the average individual among the top-earning borrowers would receive $5,944 in forgiveness, while those with the lowest incomes would receive $1,070 in forgiveness, according to the study, authored by economists Sylvain Catherine and Constantine Yannelis.

The pattern is similar under policies forgiving up to $10,000 in debt, with higher-income households still seeing significantly more loan forgiveness, according to the study.

""Full or partial forgiveness is regressive because high earners took larger loans, but also because, for low earners, balances greatly overstate present values,"" they argued, noting that individuals on income-driven repayment plans will already have their remaining balances forgiven after 25 years.

Instead of canceling all student loan debt, the economists said, the federal government should consider expanding income-driven repayment plans to cover more people.

""Forgiveness would benefit the top decile as much as the bottom three deciles combined,"" they said. ""Blacks and Hispanics would also benefit substantially less than balances suggest. Enrolling households who would benefit from income-driven repayment is the least expensive and most progressive policy we consider.""

Less than one-third of all student debt is held by households without a bachelor's degree — while nearly two-fifths of debt is held by households with graduate degrees. A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that most of the economic suffering from the crisis is concentrated among less-educated individuals.

Still, the Biden administration is reportedly considering income caps for eligibility for student loan relief that would exclude higher-income earners, according to the Washington Post. Officials have floated the possibility of limiting the relief to people who earned less than $125,000 or $150,000 as individual filers the previous year. That would amount to a threshold of roughly $250,000 to $300,000 for couples who file their taxes jointly.

The White House officials cautioned that no final decision has been made.

Biden supported erasing $10,000 in student debt for most borrowers during his presidential campaign, but has raised questions about his legal authority to do so via executive order. Last year, the president requested a memo from the Education Department to determine whether he had the power to unilaterally cancel student loan debt.

Such sweeping executive action would almost certainly face a legal challenge, and it's unclear whether it could survive. Critics have argued that using such power exceeds the president's authority granted by Congress. Canceling student loan debt would also add to the nation's already-ballooning national deficit, which totaled a near-record $2.8 trillion for the 2021 fiscal year.",http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/erasing-student-loan-debt-disproportionately-benefit-wealthy-americans

Borrowers with good credit seeking personal loans during the past seven days prequalified for rates that were lower for 3-year and higher for 5-year fixed rates compared to the previous seven days.

For borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender between Apr. 25 and May 1:

Rates on 3-year fixed-rate loans averaged 10.71%, down from 10.94% the seven days before and 11.48% a year ago.

Rates on 5-year fixed-rate loans averaged 13.38%, up from 13.35% the previous seven days and 12.83% a year ago.

Personal loans have become a popular way to consolidate and pay off credit card debt and other loans. They can also be used to cover unexpected expenses like medical bills , take care of a major purchase or fund home improvement projects .

Rates for 3-year fixed personal loans dipped over the past seven days, while rates for 5-year loans saw a slight increase. Rates for 3-year terms fell 0.23%, and rates for 5-year terms saw a slight increase of 0.03%. Borrowers can take advantage of interest savings with a 3-year or 5-year personal loan right now.

Whether a personal loan is right for you often depends on multiple factors, including what rate you can qualify for. Comparing multiple lenders and their rates could help ensure you get the best possible personal loan for your needs.

It's always a good idea to comparison shop on sites like Credible to understand how much you qualify for and choose the best option for you.

Here are the latest trends in personal loan interest rates from the Credible marketplace, updated monthly.

Personal loan weekly rates trends

The chart above shows average prequalified rates for borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender.

For the month of April 2022:

Rates on 3-year personal loans averaged 10.69%, up from 10.36% in March.

Rates on 5-year personal loans averaged 13.36%, up from 12.73% in March.

Rates on personal loans vary considerably by credit score and loan term. If you're curious about what kind of personal loan rates you may qualify for, you can use an online tool like Credible to compare options from different private lenders. Checking your rates won't affect your credit score.

All Credible marketplace lenders offer fixed-rate loans at competitive rates. Because lenders use different methods to evaluate borrowers, it’s a good idea to request personal loan rates from multiple lenders so you can compare your options.

Current personal loan rates by credit score

In April, the average prequalified rate selected by borrowers was:

8.42% for borrowers with credit scores of 780 or above choosing a 3-year loan

29.46% for borrowers with credit scores below 600 choosing a 5-year loan

Depending on factors such as your credit score, which type of personal loan you’re seeking and the loan repayment term, the interest rate can differ.

As shown in the chart above, a good credit score can mean a lower interest rate, and rates tend to be higher on loans with fixed interest rates and longer repayment terms.

How to get a lower interest rate

Many factors influence the interest rate a lender might offer you on a personal loan. But you can take some steps to boost your chances of getting a lower interest rate. Here are some tactics to try.

Increase credit score

Generally, people with higher credit scores qualify for lower interest rates. Steps that can help you improve your credit score over time include:

Pay bills on time. Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.

Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due. Check your credit report. Look at your credit report to ensure there are no errors on it. If you find errors, dispute them with the credit bureau.

Look at your credit report to ensure there are no errors on it. If you find errors, dispute them with the credit bureau. Lower your credit utilization ratio. Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit scoring factor.

Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit scoring factor. Avoid opening new credit accounts. Only apply for and open credit accounts you actually need. Too many hard inquiries on your credit report in a short amount of time could lower your credit score.

Choose a shorter loan term

Personal loan repayment terms can vary from one to several years. Generally, shorter terms come with lower interest rates, since the lender’s money is at risk for a shorter period of time.

If your financial situation allows, applying for a shorter term could help you score a lower interest rate. Keep in mind the shorter term doesn’t just benefit the lender — by choosing a shorter repayment term, you’ll pay less interest over the life of the loan.

Get a cosigner

You may be familiar with the concept of a cosigner if you have student loans. If your credit isn’t good enough to qualify for the best personal loan interest rates, finding a cosigner with good credit could help you secure a lower interest rate.

Just remember, if you default on the loan, your cosigner will be on the hook to repay it. And cosigning for a loan could also affect their credit score.

Compare rates from different lenders

Before applying for a personal loan, it’s a good idea to shop around and compare offers from several different lenders to get the lowest rates. Online lenders typically offer the most competitive rates – and can be quicker to disburse your loan than a brick-and-mortar establishment.

But don’t worry, comparing rates and terms doesn’t have to be a time-consuming process.

Credible makes it easy. Just enter how much you want to borrow and you’ll be able to compare multiple lenders to choose the one that makes the most sense for you.

190,"Today's mortgage rates: 30-year rates drop | May 2, 2022","Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as ""Credible"" below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage refinance rates have risen for three key terms and fallen for one other term since last Friday.

Rates last updated on May 2, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. With 5,000 reviews, Credible maintains an ""excellent"" Trustpilot score.

What this means: Rates for 30-year terms fell today, while rates for three other terms went up. With longer terms still holding steady above 5%, homeowners looking to refinance may want to consider shorter terms for greater interest savings, ahead of future increases.

Today’s mortgage rates for home purchases

Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage rates for home purchases have risen for two key terms and fallen for one other term since last Friday.

Rates last updated on May 2, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 5,000 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).

What this means: Mortgage rates for a 30-year term, which is the most popular, fell today, giving buyers an opportunity to lock in a slightly lower rate. Buyers who can swing a higher monthly payment may want to consider locking in a rate for a 10-year term. At 4.375%, a 10-year rate can offer even more interest savings for buyers than a longer-term rate.

To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage or refinance, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.

Are you looking to buy a home? Credible can help you compare current rates from multiple mortgage lenders at once in just a few minutes. Use Credible’s online tools to compare rates and get prequalified today.

How Credible mortgage rates are calculated

Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment, and other factors influence the movement of mortgage rates. Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

Credible mortgage rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors.

How to get low mortgage rates

If you want to get the lowest possible monthly mortgage payment, taking the following steps can help you secure a lower rate on your home loan:

Improving your credit score

Paying down debt

Making a bigger down payment

It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders to find the best rate for your financial goals. According to research from Freddie Mac , borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote — and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes.

If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credible's free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.

191,Traveling soon? 5 smart tech steps to take before you hit the road,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Travel now means your tickets, maps, hotel, rental car, and more are all stored on your phone. But what happens if that goes missing? Here’s how to find your phone when it’s lost — even if the battery is dead .

The other big phone emergency? Your battery is dying, and you have to leave for the airport. Whoops. Tap or click for smart ways to get more life out of your battery .

Travel can be stressful, but these hacks can make a huge difference.

1. Keep a (digital) eye on your stuff

Digital trackers help you keep an eye on your valuables and find them if you lose anything. I put an Apple AirTag on my dog’s collar, my key chains, my bike, and in my cars. Here are 10 clever ways you can use an AirTag .

AirTags use signals from other iPhones to determine where they are located. Using the Find My app, you can see the location of every AirTag associated with your account. It's a good idea to throw one in your checked baggage. This way, you can see whether your bag makes it to your destination.

But the AirTag will be worthless when your luggage goes through the airport's inner conveyor belt system. There typically aren't enough iPhones nearby for the AirTag to work. But once your luggage is out of there, you'll know exactly where it's located.

Want to grab a few now while you’re thinking about it?

Apple’s AirTags are ideal if you have an iPhone, Mac, or iPad.

are ideal if you have an iPhone, Mac, or iPad. The Tile 2-pack is Android compatible, and has a tracker for your luggage and one to slide into your wallet.

2. Track flights the easy way

Here’s a handy iPhone trick if you have a family member or friend picking you up from the airport. Send a text with the airline you’re flying and your flight number, such as ""Southwest Airlines 1175.""

The person can tap on the message to open a flight tracker. They can see the flight's progress and estimated arrival time without searching for the flight online or on a tracking site. Easy!

If your ride uses an Android, they can do a web search for the airline and flight number to see the same info.

This travel hack is great! Uber has a new way to have a car waiting for you when you land. Your Uber driver will track your flight. Here’s my 60-second tip about how it works .

3. Get these photos on your phone

There are essential photos I have on my phone. Worst case scenario, you lose your wallet. It will be a lot smoother getting home if you have photos of your essential documents.

Be sure to include your license, passport and health insurance card at a minimum.

The easiest way to do that on an iPhone is to use the handy document scanner built into the native Notes app.

Open the Notes app. Create a new note by clicking the icon that looks like a square with a pen located at the bottom right of the screen. Tap the camera icon at the bottom of your new note and select Scan Documents.

On an Android, snap some photos and mark them as favorites in your picture gallery or use the scan feature in Google Drive:

Open the Google Drive app . Tap the plus button in the bottom right corner.

. Tap the in the bottom right corner. Tap Scan and allow access to your camera if you have not already. Follow the on-screen prompts to take and save your photos.

Pro Tip: I also recommend saving your identifying documents as PDF files and saving a copy to your iOS Books, Android e-book app or even sending to your Kindle. This way, you can access them offline. You might also want to send a copy to your travel partner.

SMART STEP: Take my advice and upload these 9 photos you should always have on your phone at your fingertips . You’ll thank me later!

4. Check your rental for hidden spy cameras

It's happened to me. I rented a home, settled in, and realized how many cameras were watching me. It was very unsettling.

If you rent through Airbnb, cameras are allowed in public spaces and common spaces but not in bathrooms or bedrooms. They cannot be hidden and must be disclosed in the listing descriptions. VRBO forbids indoor cameras altogether, though outdoor cameras are permitted for "" reasonable monitoring .""

Larger cameras are easy to spot, but anyone can easily hide smaller cameras behind furniture, vents, or decorations. Then there are the hidden cameras that can masquerade as all kinds of things, from a Roku to an outlet extender. Seriously, you'll be shocked when you see these things .

A simple way to spot most types of cameras is to look for the lens reflection. Turn off the lights and slowly scan the room with a flashlight or laser pointer, looking for bright reflections. Scan the room from multiple spots, so you don't miss a camera pointed only at certain places. Inspect the vents, too, and any holes or gaps in the walls or ceilings.

You can also get an RF detector . This gadget can pick up wireless cameras you might not see.

If you can connect to the rental’s wireless network, a free program like Wireless Network Watcher shows what gadgets are connected. You might be able to spot connected cameras. Just be aware that the owner might have put the cameras on a second network, or they could be wired or record-only types.

If you find an indoor surveillance camera that was not disclosed to you, pick up the phone and call the police. Tell them you have direct evidence that your landlord is spying on you inside your rental home without your knowledge or permission. Use this exact phrase.

Document the situation with video and photos on your smartphone. Once you have your police report, contact the rental site.

5. Find the comfiest seat

If you're tall, you know how important a few extra inches of legroom are on a flight. It can be the difference between being comfy or cramped for hours.

Google Flights is a great way to find the cheapest flight, but you take an extra step to find the most comfortable seat.

Get the Chrome browser extension called Legroom for Google Flights . When using Google Flights, you'll also see how much legroom per seat per flight you selected.

. When using Google Flights, you'll also see how much legroom per seat per flight you selected. Another solid option is SeatGuru.com . Enter your airline and flight number, and you’ll see a map of the best seats with the most legroom, no download required.

192,3 ways Incognito mode can save you,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

We willingly give our most personal data so often to advertisers, Big Tech, scammers, and everyone else looking to make a dime off us. Want to take control back? Start with changing a few settings that make it easier for strangers and companies to pinpoint who you are in your Chrome browser .

While you’re at it, take a minute and look at your Facebook account settings. Tap or click for three steps to limit or stop targeted ads .

Your browser offers Incognito or private mode. It’s not a privacy catch-all, but it can make a real difference.

Is Incognito mode private? Sort of …

While Incognito mode in any browser does provide more privacy than if you’re not using it, incognito isn’t as private as we were led to believe.

When you surf the web incognito, your browser doesn't save your browsing history, cookies, site data or information you enter in forms. However, it keeps any downloaded files or bookmarks created during the session.

Your internet service provider can still see your activity, as can a school or employer providing your internet access or computer. Want to stop that? You need a VPN .

That leads us to the question, ""Is Incognito mode even worth using?""

Yes, let’s look at three situations.

1. Trying to keep gifts a surprise

When you shop online, your browser keeps tabs on what you’ve perused. Later, you’ll see ads pop up on other sites that try to get you to come back to make the purchase — even if you’ve already bought the item.

You might not be the only person seeing those ads. If the person you're buying the gift for uses your computer, tablet, or smartphone, they will see the same ads. They may see them on their own devices, too, since you share an IP address.

Of course, these ads tip them to what you’re up to. That won’t happen if you shop in Incognito mode.

Stop throwing money down the drain: 5 ways you're ruining your expensive phone, laptop, tablet, and TV.

2. Stopping the algorithm’s watchful eye

We all look up things we don't want to follow us around the web for years. Maybe you're worried about an illness, or you need to look up a tutorial on doing a task around the house.

It’s annoying to see reminders of those searches everywhere, especially in your YouTube algorithm. You can avoid these suggestions by searching in Incognito mode.

You’ll notice that I said YouTube. Yes, Incognito mode isn’t just for your browser. You can search YouTube Incognito, too — but only from your phone. Here’s how:

Open the YouTube app .

. Tap your profile picture in the top right of the screen, then tap Turn on Incognito.

This feature only works when you're signed in. When browsing incognito, your watch history, searches, and other activity won’t be saved to your profile.

Did you know there are hidden apps on your phone? No, I don’t mean creepy spyware. These are useful, handy little features you should know .

3. Separating your work and home life

Most of us have two versions of our online selves: Work and personal.

It's a pain when you want to check your personal inbox, but you're logged into your work account — especially if you use the same provider for both. Instead of using different browsers or signing in and out of your accounts, use Incognito mode.

Try signing into your work email using your browser like usual, then open an incognito window for your personal account. Easy.

PRO TIP: You can go even further by setting up separate browser profiles for work and life. You can bookmark, change your settings, or install extensions to make each profile more useful.

Tap or click here to do that in your favorite browser . We cover Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Sorry, Safari users, but Apple doesn’t offer this option.

195,"In football coach prayer case, students' religious liberty is at risk","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Supreme Court may be about to fumble a major case involving a former high school football coach who sought to impose prayer on his players.

The court has taken up the case of former high school football coach Joe Kennedy and his allegations that the Bremerton School District in Washington State violated his free speech and free exercise rights. But the religious liberty that is actually at stake belongs to student athletes who are at the mercy of their coach. Public school coaches cannot be allowed to abuse their position of authority to impose religion on students.

Kennedy’s attorneys have sought to wave a magic wand and distort the facts of the case in order to secure a victory before the court and the court of public opinion. At various times, they have claimed that Kennedy’s post-game prayers on the 50-yard line were ""private,"" ""silent"" and ""personal.""

NBC OP-ED SOUNDS ALARM OVER SUPREME COURT POTENTIALLY SIDING WITH FOOTBALL COACH FIRED FOR ON-FIELD PRAYERS

None of those descriptors is accurate. An appellate judge even called Kennedy’s attorneys’ version of events a ""deceitful narrative.""

For years, Kennedy imposed his religion on football players by reciting team prayers not only on the field at the 50-yard line after games but, tellingly, also in the locker room. He bragged about his 50-yard line prayers on Fox News Radio in October 2015, saying that the ""entire team"" joined him. It was apparent at the time that he wanted to continue to involve students in the prayers.

Now, the former coach wants to spin the case and claim the school system is somehow stifling his right to engage in private prayer. In reality, the school district tried valiantly to accommodate him.

Kennedy refused an accommodation that would allow him to pray in the school building, athletic facility, press box or on the 50-yard line after his duties as coach had ended. He refused to stop making his communal prayer part of a public school sporting event.

SUPREME COURT CAN SAVE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR FOOTBALL COACHES, AND FOR ALL AMERICANS

It is entirely reasonable, and constitutional, for the Bremerton School District to make sure that an employee’s religious activity is not interfering with job duties. Ultimately, the former coach’s prayers became a spectacle and interfered with the rights of conscience of students.

TEACHERS AND COACHES DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTED

At the homecoming game in 2015, Kennedy and an onslaught of pious performance artists rushed the field after the game, knocking over some students. Kennedy invited a state legislator to join his prayer and address the team.

True religious freedom means that students are not pressured or encouraged by school staff to engage in religious activity. Religion is personal and students’ rights of conscience must not be interfered with by a coach who wants to impose religion on other people’s children.

One Bremerton parent reported that his son felt ""compelled to participate"" because he feared that he ""wouldn’t get to play as much.""

Other parents said that their children participated in the prayers because they didn’t want to be separated from the team.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh recognized such concerns during the oral argument this week when he noted that every player ""is trying to get on the good side of the coach.""

Inevitably, those with minority viewpoints, such as the third of teenagers today who have no religious affiliation, Jewish students, or even Christians who are not evangelical, become outsiders once school staff members lead students in prayer. Also, non-Christian prayers will have to be permitted on the same terms.

Already in Bremerton, a local Satanist group has expressed interest in conducting post-game religious ceremonies.

Those who are cheering for a ""win"" for Kennedy should fully consider the implications. Be careful what you wish for.

The solution to this acrimonious religious controversy has already been found. Decades of Supreme Court cases reaffirm the wisdom of separating state and church, especially in our public schools.

It is students who are at risk of having their religious freedom violated, not a zealous coach who was given every opportunity to exercise his religion without interfering with the rights of others.

No student ought to be expected to pray to play, or to ""get on the good side of a coach,"" in a nation predicated on true religious liberty.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coach-kennedy-supreme-court-prayer-case-students-religious-liberty-patrick-elliott

The world’s oldest living person is a 118-year-old woman from France.

Lucile Randon, who’s also the world’s oldest living nun, has recently moved up a place as the world’s oldest living person — after the recent death of 119-year-old Kane Tanaka of Japan.

In an email to Fox News Digital, Guinness World Records confirmed that Randon is the current world record holder for the ""oldest person living (female)"" and the ""overall oldest person living.""

WORLD'S OLDEST PERSON DIES AT AGE 119

Randon, or Sister André, as the people of France know her, has a long list of accomplishments attached to her name.

Here are 10 quick life facts about Randon that you should know.

1. Sister André was born before World War I

Randon was born in France on Feb. 11, 1904. That’s 10 years, five months and 17 days before the start of World War I, which kicked off on July 28, 1914.

2. She shares a birth year with many famous figures

Randon was born in the same year that many famous figures were, including American author Dr. Seuss, Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali and American actress Joan Crawford.

3. She’s been a nun for 78 years

Randon became a Catholic nun in 1944 and took the name of Sister André, according to Guinness World Records.

4. She has a long history of helping people

Before she became a nun, Randon worked as a teacher, a governess and a child care provider during World War II (Sept. 1, 1939, to Sept. 2, 1945), according to Guinness World Records.

With Mother's Day 2022 coming up shortly, many have already turned their focus and thoughts toward the moms, stepmoms, aunts, grandmothers and others who have made a tremendous difference in their lives — and helped them become the people they are today.

One rabbi in Florida shared the impact his own mother has had on his life.

""My mom and her family always taught me the value of faith and a love for America,"" said Rabbi Pinchas Taylor of Plantation, Florida.

""We didn't have much money growing up, but my mom would regularly sacrifice her own comforts and even needs.""

He said that his mom, Linda, ""taught me that if you want something, you need to fight for it. Never give up. I've tried to live with this tenacity my whole life,"" he told Fox News Digital.

He said that when he was growing up, ""she always went out of her way to have fun with us … She encouraged my brother and me in the things we were interested in.""

‘SPIRITUAL MOTHERS’ SHARE WISDOM, STRENGTH FOREVER

The rabbi, who today is married and has seven children of his own, said, ""We didn't have much money growing up, but my mom would regularly sacrifice her own comforts and even needs to make sure we would have new clothes for school, birthday parties or a chance to go at least a few weeks to summer camp.""

""Looking back now, with an adult's perspective,"" he added, ""I can see the efforts were nothing short of heroic.""

MOTHER'S DAY GIFT IDEAS FOR 2022

It said that for him, ""It's a pleasure to relive my mom's interaction with her own kids as I watch her now interact with her grandkids.""

Mothers are ""central to Jewish life"" and play a tremendous role in the biblical narrative.

He also recounted ""a fond and funny memory"" that happened on a recurring basis throughout his childhood.

Said Taylor, ""She had a tremendous fear of cockroaches. If there was one in the house, she would scream and empty an entire container of Raid trying to spray it while it ran through the house.""

‘Central’ figures

Mothers are ""central to Jewish life"" and play a tremendous role in the biblical narrative, Rabbi Taylor shared with Fox News Digital.

""The first woman in the Bible was Eve, whose Hebrew name (Chava) translates as the ‘mother of all living things,’"" said Taylor.

""Adam, the first man in the Bible, has no parental quality in the Hebrew etymology of his name. The maternal role is of paramount importance to humanity,"" he added.

""Of the many things I’ve learned from my own mother, having a simple and sincere faith ranks highest on the list.""

""Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah — the four matriarchs — are revered and commemorated by the four cups of wine at the Passover seder,"" added Taylor.

""Jewish scriptural tradition emphasizes that the heroic mothers in Egypt risked their lives and defied Pharaoh’s order to drown the Israelite boys in the Nile, and that it was the women and mothers who faithfully anticipated redemption from slavery.""

""King Solomon described all Jewish living experience as being from our mothers (Proverbs 1:8).""

Said Taylor, ""It is she who teaches that there is a flavor, a scent, a warmth to fulfilling the commandments. Of the many things I’ve learned from my own mother, having a simple and sincere faith ranks highest on the list.""

ALVEDA KING SHARES IMPORTANCE OF FOOD, FAMILY ON MOTHER'S DAY

""The mother gives of her essence, nurturing the embryo in her womb — and Jewish law decisively states that being born a Jew is passed on exclusively through the mother,"" he said.

He also noted that the ""Hebrew word for faith (emunah) is based on the word for mother (em).""

Taylor added, ""This root word is at the heart of many Hebrew words referring to deeply internalized knowledge and values that shape us at our core.""

""Mother’s Day is an excellent opportunity to reawaken our gratitude to our mothers, which we should have year-round.""

""[So] when we seek faith, we are in a sense searching for an inner mother, something to nurture us, particularly during hard times.""

MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS, WALKED THE PATH OF ALL STRUGGLING MOTHERS TODAY

This is why, he also said, ""Mother’s Day is an excellent opportunity to reawaken our gratitude to our mothers, which we should have year-round, and perhaps an opportunity to rejuvenate our connection with God and our faith as well.""

Chase Elliott won the Duramax Drydene 400 NASCAR Cup Series race at Dover on Monday, 24 hours after it began.

The race had been postponed after 78 laps due to rain on Sunday and resumed at Noon Monday under sunny skies.

Points-leader Elliott was in second place for the restart behind teammate Kyle Larson and becomes the last of the four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to win a race in the 2022 season.

Ricky Stenhouse Jr. finished a comfortable second ahead of Ross Chastain who made contact with Martin Truex Jr. on the final lap, causing the Joe Gibbs Racing driver to skid out of contention and eventually finish 12th. Christopher Bell and Alex Bowman rounded out the top five.

There appears to be a new Ram pickup in the works that's definitely not the electric one coming in 2024.

The truck brand has received a patent for a uniquely-outfitted version of the Ram 1500 that it describes as a ""new design.""

The patent uncovered by Fox News Autos was published in April and shows what appears to be a new version of the Ram 1500 Rebel equipped with some interesting off-road gear.

Along with a redesigned grille that incorporates a row of auxiliary lighting, the pickup features a built-in winch, fender flares with exposed bolts and a large air intake snorkel that wouldn't be needed on an electric vehicle.

Snorkels are used on off-road vehicles to help prevent dirt and water from getting into the engine. Chevrolet currently offers one from the factory on the Colorado ZR2 Bison as will Ford on the upcoming Bronco Everglades.

201,Legendary NASCAR 'con man' L.W. Wright reveals himself after 40 years in hiding,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

He’s one of the most famous NASCAR drivers of all time, even though he only completed 13 laps in his career.

L.W. Wright was an unknown racer who entered and qualified for the 1982 Winston 500 at Talladega in 36th place. No one on the NASCAR circuit had heard of him before, despite claims, which turned out to be false, that he’d made several prior starts in the Cup Series.

Hailing from Nashville, Wright had obtained his car from the shop of Sterling Marlin, who also provided a pit crew for the event. He was black-flagged 13 laps into the race for being too slow, however, and then his story turned into a legend.

Wright allegedly abandoned the car at the track and disappeared, leaving a string of bounced checks in his wake. B.W. Terrell, a team owner who had reportedly assisted in getting him the car, told the press at the time that Wright owed him over $30,000 for the transaction and other help.

Wright’s whereabouts have been unknown in the years since, but on Monday, May 2, which marks the 40th anniversary of the race, the NASCAR-focused ""The Scene Vault Podcast"" released an episode featuring an interview with a man who says he is him.

Podcast host and motorsports journalist Rick Houston told Fox News Autos that he’d been trying to track down Wright for over a year through someone who knew him and in April received a call saying he was ready to talk.

Houston describes how he wasn’t given an address, but was instructed to drive to a location on a highway where he would meet up with someone who would lead him to Wright.

Wright told Houston his real name is Larry Wright and showed him the racing suit he wore at Talladega as proof. There’s only one published photo of Wright from the race, and Houston said both he and the suit are a perfect match.

Houston has only released a portion of the interview, as he is saving most of it for future projects, but Wright tells a somewhat different story in the clips than what has been reported before.

He said he was a bus driver working in the music industry in Nashville and received money from music stars Waylon Jennings, George Jones and Merle Haggard, all since deceased, to help pay for his Talladega entry.

As he explains, he told Marlin he’d pay him for the car after the race, but didn’t. He also never paid bills for tires from Goodyear and his NASCAR competition license. A representative for Marlin has not yet responded to a request for comment on the story from Fox News Autos.

Records show that Wright actually attempted to qualify for the next race at the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway the following week. He chalks up his unpaid bills to a sponsor who backed out after he failed to qualify for the event, but denies he ever owed Terrell $30,000.

""If you can find somebody that said that I owe them $30,000, you tell them I’ll face them,"" Wright said.

Terrell passed away in 1998 and his son, Bernie, told Fox News Autos that he remembers hearing the stories about his father loaning Wright the money and a truck, but that he’s not sure how accurate they are. He said his father never really talked about it with him and that it didn’t seem like a big deal that weighed on him.

Houston said Wright’s personal history is still a little cloudy, but that he’s confident what he told him about the events surrounding Talladega are mostly accurate. Wright admits never having been in a Cup Series race before it, but Houston said he had competed in small-time stock car racing.

Among a few details Wright shared were his first impression of the track, which he’d never seen before arriving for the race weekend.

""I looked over at my brother and I said, ‘Lord, have mercy. Ain’t no way,’"" he told Houston. ""Lord, I’m down here, but I’m gonna need some help.""

Wright’s car wore the number 34, which he said was both his age and a tribute to Black NASCAR pioneer Wendell Scott, who, like him, raced without a lot of means. He claims that Dale Earnhardt told him, ""When you get out there, you get on the back of someone who’s been here before and follow them. Stay with them, and then make your move.""

Fox Sports NASCAR analyst Larry McReynolds, who was at the race as part of Donnie Allison's team and worked with Earnhardt a few years later, doesn't have direct knowledge of Wright's claims, but said Earnhardt was the type of driver who often offered advice to rookies.

Wright crashed on his second qualifying lap, but the car was repaired for the race. The daunting 2.66-mile oval proved too much of a challenge, however, and officials decided to get him off the track for safety.

Journalist Steve Wade, who was at the event, said they didn’t think much about it at the time because then it was easier to enter a NASCAR race and there were always a couple of local drivers who tried to race at Talladega.

According to Houston, Wright is in poor health and wanted to get his side of the story out there while he still can.

Houston said he is working on a book and entertaining offers for other ways to share more of Wright’s story.",http://www.foxnews.com/auto/nascar-con-man-l-w-wright

203,Hawaii’s stray cats pose major threat to protected species: Why visitors should be cautious,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Plenty of cats may look cute and cuddly, but the strays in Hawaii are doing more damage there than many people realize, according to experts.

And for all those planning a visit to The Aloha State this year — whether in the week ahead (National Travel and Tourism Week is May 1-7, 2022) or later in 2022 — this information is useful.

The majority of wild and feral cats throughout the Hawaiian Islands tend to hunt certain protected species of wildlife; plus, they spread disease.

HAWAII'S THREATENED SPECIES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT PROTECTED WILDLIFE ON THE ISLANDS

Experts at Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) are cautioning visitors against interacting with the cats. The aquatic division’s Ryan Jenkinson, PhD, shared in an interview with Fox News Digital exactly how the cats are harming Hawaiian wildlife.

""They are incredibly destructive animals to the native species in Hawaii,"" he said.

next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Since Hawaii’s species evolved without the threat of predators, a lot of the animals — Hawaiian monk seals included — are not equipped with defense mechanisms to ward off predatory cats.

Cats don’t hunt or harass monk seals, but they’re still a primary suspect in seal mortality, due to toxoplasmosis. This disease is transmitted through oocytes found in feline feces, which wash down into the streams and eventually the ocean, Jenkinson noted.

""Cats are amazing predators of wildlife,"" said Josh Atwood of the forestry division.

""The parasite, for some reason, really reacts strongly with marine mammals,"" he said. ""It has a disproportionate effect on monk seals … The worst part about it is, it seems to target females, especially pregnant females.""

Humans can also contract toxoplasmosis through increased exposure to cats, which the expert said has a ""legitimate"" impact on brain function.

HAWAII'S HIDDEN TREASURES INCLUDE THESE HISTORIC WAR MONUMENTS IN OAHU

Jenkinson also mentioned the ""almost unbelievable"" number of native birds that cats kill per year.

Meanwhile, DLNR forestry division’s Josh Atwood confirmed that some seabirds that nest on the ground are being attacked.

""Cats are amazing predators of wildlife,"" he said. ""Even ‘fed’ cats have an instinct to hunt wild animals.""

The department has captured footage of cats slinking into bird burrows to hunt.

The expert added that toxoplasmosis — harmful to marine mammals — can infect birds as well.

It might be difficult to ignore large groups of adorable-looking cats when visiting Hawaii, but the two experts agreed that feeding and nurturing the cats will only worsen the issue and further the spread of disease.

""It’s so hard because you don’t realize that by giving them food, letting them continue to reproduce — they’re having this huge impact on our native species here,"" Jenkinson said.

""It is a really hard subject because people really love their cats.""

""Cats in sanctuaries … go visit them, pet them,"" Atwood said.

""Just a suggestion for people visiting: Don’t feed the cats,"" he added. ""If you want to take them home with you — awesome.""

For visitors who would like to be affectionate in a ""safe space"" with Hawaii’s cats, Lanai Cat Sanctuary allows tourists to interact with cats in a protected enclosure.

The private, non-profit organization, recommended by Atwood, is located on the island of Lanai and makes an effort to separate the cats from the outdoor areas inhabited by native species.

206,Does 'hair of the dog' actually work after drinking alcohol? What experts say about the hangover 'cure',"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

There's a belief that drinking more alcohol when you’re already hungover can cure you of some rough symptoms.

The tactic seemingly stems from the medieval theory that the source of an ailment could also be the remedy for it.

IF YOU'RE DRINKING MORE ALCOHOL, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

This thought eventually led to the expression ""the hair of the dog that bit you,"" which resulted in the development of fur-filled tonics from suspected rabid dogs in hopes of preventing rabies infections in humans, according to Lexico, an online dictionary powered by the Oxford University Press.

While the questionable tonics didn’t work and fell out of favor with the rise of modern medicine, the ""hair of the dog"" expression has stuck around, and it has even become associated with drinking.

Unlike its predecessor, though, there might be a little truth to treating alcohol-induced hangovers with alcohol, but experts still don't recommend it. Here’s why.

Does 'hair of the dog' work?

""The short answer is yes,"" said Dr. Ken Perry, an emergency physician in South Carolina.

""The feeling of a hangover is due to the receptors being without alcohol,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Many of the symptoms [including headache and gastrointestinal upset] are minimized if the alcohol is reintroduced and the receptors are no longer absent of alcohol.""

""In a way, the ‘hair of the dog’ does actually work in the short term,"" Perry continued. ""That being said, it doesn’t fix a hangover, but rather delays the symptoms.""

The NIAAA’s input on ‘hair of the dog’

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) addressed the hair of the dog theory in an online brochure.

DOES 'DRY JANUARY' ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH?

The government agency’s brochure states that drinking alcohol while hungover ""might temporarily minimize some symptoms"" — but ""it could contribute to and prolong the malaise and other symptoms of the hangover.""

If you’re trying to find an actual hangover cure, you’re sadly out of luck, according to the NIAAA, which is a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

TANQUERAY IS LAUNCHING ALCOHOL-FREE GIN

""The only way to completely avoid a hangover is to not drink alcohol at all or to keep alcohol intake to a minimum,"" the NIAAA’s brochure said.

""There is no cure for a hangover other than time.""

Are there better options than ‘hair of the dog'?

A 2017 news release from the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina, which was published in Science Daily, said the hair of the dog theory for alcohol consumption has no scientific evidence to back it up.

""It will, at best, postpone"" a hangover, said Laura Veach, who’s a doctoral degree holder in substance counseling, in a statement.

""Taking a drink the morning after may temporarily make you feel better because you're putting alcohol back into the system,"" she said.

""But it doesn't cure the hangover; it just sort of tricks you by masking the symptoms. They're going to show up eventually.""

Hangover symptoms reportedly occur when blood alcohol content drops to zero; symptoms can include undesirable results such as headache, thirst, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and poor mood, according to the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

Like so many other Americans, Katie Schmitt, 43, of Rochester, was laid off from her job in June 2020, during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic.

She had worked, at that point, at the same nonprofit for 10 years, she said.

Schmitt was about 100 pounds overweight, had high blood pressure and had low energy, she said.

""I was thrown into a different life during the pandemic,"" Schmitt told Fox News Digital during an interview. ""It was a really dark time, I think for a lot of people, and I definitely felt that.""

FORMER ‘JEOPARDY!’ WINNER SHEDS 200 POUNDS: ‘I WAS ABLE TO STICK WITH IT’

That’s when Schmitt began evaluating her goals for the future.

""As I was doing that, I recognized that my weight would hold me back,"" Schmitt said.

At the time, Schmitt said she was about 100 pounds overweight and had high blood pressure and had low energy. She also struggled with depression after losing family members, she said.

""I was just feeling awful,"" Schmitt said.

‘Building self-care habits and skills’

So after doing research into various programs and methods of weight loss, Schmitt said she landed on WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers), joining in November 2020. At the time, she weighed 240 pounds.

Schmitt had tried weight loss strategies before that but would often quit after less than a month. This time, she made a plan and stuck to it.

""I said, ‘I’m going to follow this beyond those three weeks and at that three-week period, I’m going to be on target with myself,’"" Schmitt said, adding that she checked in with herself on an hourly basis.

""I was thrown into a different life during the pandemic.""

""I would ask myself, ‘Am I really hungry? Is this a real hunger or if I have a cup of tea, is that going to be a better option for me right now?’ Or maybe I’m just feeling a little anxious and I need to take a walk,"" Schmitt said.

In those moments when she thought eating would make her feel better, she looked for other options.

""It was really about building those self-care habits and skills,"" Schmitt said. ""I had a list of options printed out, [showing] what else I [could] do besides eat.""

Schmitt's secret was to make her journey more about healing than weight loss.

She first focused on her sleeping and eating habits. She made it a point to not look at the number on the scale, either.

""I know that sounds crazy, but that’s really what happened for me,"" she said.

Eventually, Schmitt eased into activity by adding 10-minute walks to her daily routine.

""My knees hurt, my hips hurt, my body was sore from carrying that extra weight and so it was really important for me to start moving. But I knew I couldn’t just go from zero to 100 miles per hour,"" Schmitt said.

‘Rewarded with better energy’

Schmitt began focusing on what she was bringing into her life — including getting more sunshine and reading poetry — rather than what she was restricting or removing.

""I was creating in my art studio. I was finding ways essentially to pass the time while I was on this journey so that it felt better, it felt beautiful,"" she added. ""That was really important to me, to create something that was beautiful and not just about exercise and food.""

Schmitt challenged the common idea — something she'd heard all her life — that weight loss is ""hard."" Instead, she wrote lists in her journal about positive habits and self-care.

""I believed it,"" Schmitt said about the notion that losing weight is difficult. ""I thought, ‘Well, then, it’s not for me. I can’t do it because it’s hard.’""

""Do I feel healthy? Do I have the energy?""

""I said, ‘How do I make this easier for myself?’""

As she lost weight, Schmitt said she was motivated to keep going because of how she felt. ""I was getting rewarded with better energy [and] feeling better,"" Schmitt said.

Though the coronavirus pandemic was challenging for Schmitt, she said that losing weight was actually a way to ""control something in my life.""

""That health and wellness piece was something that I could latch onto, to get me through some of those things that were way out of our control during that time,"" Schmitt said of the pandemic.

One of the challenges for Schmitt, while she worked on losing weight during the pandemic, was the isolation from her friends and family — but having the support of her husband was essential.

""I would ask people questions, people who were on the same weight loss journey … They were the people who had done it.""

""My spouse was really important,"" Schmitt said. ""He was on board in terms of helping prep food, he would eat the food that I cooked … We were in it together, in those terms.""

Schmitt said she also relied on the social media function of the WW app; she followed and talked to people who had overcome some of the same challenges she was trying to overcome.

""That, for me, was everything,"" Schmitt said. ""I would ask people questions, people who were on the same weight loss journey … They were the people who had done it.""

‘It feels really good’

Schmitt said her initial goal was to lose 100 pounds.

Once she hit her original goal weight of 140, Schmitt decided to lose another five pounds to see how she felt.

When she did, Schmitt said she asked herself: ""How does this feel on my body? Do I feel like it’s hard to maintain? Do I feel healthy? Do I have the energy?""

""It’s much easier than I thought it would be at this point.""

After that, Schmitt lost another five pounds and asked herself the same questions.

She did that again for a third time before settling on her current weight.

Today, Schmitt weighs about 123 pounds — so she's down 117 pounds from her starting weight back in November 2020.

Schmitt said she’s been able to maintain her weight of between 123 and 125 pounds for the last three months.

""It’s much easier than I thought it would be at this point,"" Schmitt said.

""It feels really good,"" she added. ""I’m at a healthy BMI [body mass index], my blood pressure is down [and] my doctor is super happy.""

‘Time is going to pass either way’

Schmitt has advice for those seeking a lifestyle change.

MINNESOTA COUPLE LOSES MORE THAN 200 POUNDS COMBINED

Be ""gentle with yourself,"" she said. ""You can’t hate yourself thin,"" she said, adding later, ""Let your body set the pace.""

""You get to re-imagine what weight loss looks like.""

""I remember thinking, ‘I’m in this big hole, I need to find a way to dig out and I want it done tomorrow. I don’t want to live like this anymore,’"" Schmitt said.

""The reality was, time is going to pass either way,"" she continued. ""And I have a choice during this time to get healthy, or I can continue to eat poorly and not exercise and not feel good.""

Schmitt also suggested thinking of weight loss as a lifestyle — rather than as a short-term solution or program to follow.

The singer, 41, left little to the imagination in a new Instagram post in which she showed off her bikini body in a colorful two-piece.

""I have gained and lost 100lbs 3x so I never thought this moment could or would happen, but I’m finally spring breakin’ wearin’ a BIKINI!!!!!!"" Simpson captioned the post.

In recent years, Simpson has been open with her fans about her journeys of losing weight and getting sober.

After welcoming her third child, a baby girl named Birdie Mae in March 2019, the singer dropped 100 pounds over the course of a year.

Speaking of her weight loss journey, her personal trainer Harley Pasternak recently revealed to E! News , ""This particular baby No. 3 was ... I think she commented to the press that she tipped the scales at 240 lbs, that's not coming from me, she mentioned that in a post.

""It had to be more than just getting back from her baby weight, but how do I keep whatever I am doing now forever. That's why we are not a big fan of doing any extreme diet or radical forms of exercise,"" he added.

Pasternak worked with Simpson's doctor to create a sustainable meal plan of lean protein and vegetables. She eats three meals a day and has two snacks like ""parmesan green beans and a handful of almonds.""

Simpson's workout plan included walking 14,000 steps a day and full-body workouts.

Simpson also spoke about becoming sober in a recent interview with Entrepreneur. She shared that her subconscious played a major role in both her personal and professional life.

""When I stopped drinking, it was because I had stopped hearing the voice I really trusted, and I was lost without her,"" Simpson told the outlet.

The ""A Public Affair"" singer then referenced a hard moment in her life, which she wrote about in her memoir , ""Open Book."" She recalled a night during a Halloween party where she had a couple of drinks and was unable to dress her children.

""I was terrified of letting them see me in that shape,"" Simpson wrote in her memoir. ""I am ashamed to say that I don't know who got them into their costumes that night.""

Since that night, Simpson remained sober, celebrating four years of sobriety Nov. 1. To acknowledge the milestone, she opened up to her Instagram followers that day.

""This person in the early morning of Nov. 1, 2017, is an unrecognizable version of myself,"" Simpson captioned her post, alongside an image of her from the day she stopped drinking.

210,Long nails may not be as hygienic as you think: report,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Long nails may make a fashion statement, but there are microorganisms lurking underneath that can cause potential infections, according to a recent USA Today report.

""The longer the nail, the more surface area there is for microorganisms to adhere,"" said Jeffrey Kaplan, a biology professor at American University.

""Studies have found 32 different bacteria and 28 different fungi underneath fingernails.""

And whether they’re artificial nails, long natural nails, gel nails, acrylic nails or just nail polish, they increase the probability that microorganisms lurk underneath them, which in turn makes it more difficult to wash off with simple handwashing, Kaplan added.

He noted one study that found that a resistant bacteria, known as methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, or MRSA, in half of fingernail samples, which could subsequently lead to an infection.

""You can transmit fingernail bacteria to your system by scratching, nail-biting, nose-picking and finger-sucking,"" Kaplan said.

The bacteria and fungi underneath the long nails can also lead to a nail infection, which could leave the fingernails disfigured.

WOMAN WITH THE LONGEST FINGERNAILS CUTS THEM FOR FIRST TIME SINCE THE 90S

In 1997-98, after an Oklahoma City hospital investigated an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacteria acquired often in the hospital setting, epidemiologists discovered a link between approximately half the 16 infants who died in the neonatal unit and the bacteria under long fingernails, according to the New York Times.

The hospital subsequently imposed measures that prohibited long nails in the neonatal intensive care unit.

""A growing body of evidence suggests that wearing artificial nails may contribute to transmission of certain healthcare associated pathogens. Healthcare workers who wear artificial nails are more likely to harbor gram-negative pathogens [like Pseudomonas] on their fingertips than are those who have natural nails, both before and after handwashing,"" according to the Centers for Disease and Prevention.

So the agency recommends that artificial nails should not be worn by health care workers who have direct patient care with high risk patients, like in the intensive care unit, and their nail tips be kept to one-fourth inch in length.

""Long nails are a perfect hideout for pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, that get trapped under there,"" said Dr Cristina Psomadakis, a dermatologist based in the U.K. and popular on Instagram as ""Dr. Soma.""

MAN NEARLY DIES FROM SEPSIS INFECTION CAUSED BY BITING HIS FINGERNAILS

""I also recommend clear polish or translucent finishes on nails. This allows us to be able to see when our nails are dirty and serves as a visual reminder to wash our hands.""

But nail technician Kayla Newman, who is based in North Carolina, said none of her clients had any infections in her eight years of practice.

""Generally people who have long nails know how to maneuver with them and keep them clean,"" she said.

""If you're spending upwards of $60 to get your nails done and you don't keep them clean, that doesn't make sense.""

She recommends for those with long nails to make regular appointments because the nail strength may shift as they grow with broken nails as the most common complaint – especially those new to them.

""Nails are an awesome luxury to have,"" she said.

""Usually on my days off, and sometimes before going to set – I end up heading to Pilates, boxing or jump rope and when that gets boring, I go rock climbing with friends or find some other activity we can tackle.""

The star insisted to the outlet that she doesn’t weigh herself or count calories. Instead, she has ""a hard rule against eating any cane sugar"" and instead, stocks up on vegetables and seafood.

""My diet generally consists of fresh, organic produce (all veggies, nuts, seafood, occasional eggs and lots of raw vegan dark chocolate) and superfoods every day such as chlorella and spirulina,"" Gale explained.

Nice cream, which is ice cream made from bananas, chocolate that’s sweetened with coconut nectar, nut butters, popcorn, etc. I just don’t believe that to be cheating.

Elsevier has launched ""the most advanced 3-D full female model ever available,"" according to a recent press release.

""This is the first time that a female model has been built with this level of detail in its entirety, to represent the female — versus replacing specific areas of the male anatomy with female features,"" the Elsevier release stated. The company, which is a known leader in publishing research and information analytics, said in the release that this model would help educators for the first time teach, visualize, and edit anatomy entirely from the female perspective using a realistic detailed 3-D model.

Historically, the female anatomy has been underrepresented in the study of the human body and the company said this is a major milestone in equal representation in helping prepare nursing, allied health and medical students with a complete understanding of the female anatomy, the release said.

Elsevier says its 3D female model includes the following clear differences from male anatomy models:

The skeletal system will accommodate changes to reflect the boney angles typically seen in the female and will demonstrate differences in areas that differ from males including in the pelvis and skull

Lead subject-matter expert on the update, Yasmin Carter, PhD, Assistant Professor of Translational Anatomy at the UMass Chan Medical School, in Worcester, MA, said in the release, ""One of the inherent dangers in using only the male body as ‘anatomical normal’ and the female body as a variation is perpetuating sexist attitudes.

FDA MOVES TO LIMIT LEAD CONTENT IN JUICES

The biotech company said the shot was about 51% effective against the virus for kids under 2 years old and about 37% effective in kids ages 2 to 5.

It added that similar requests are underway with international regulatory authorities, noting that the requests are based on a 25-microgram two-dose primary series of the vaccine.

""We are proud to share that we have initiated our EUA submission for authorization for our COVID-19 vaccine for young children,"" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. ""We believe mRNA-1273 will be able to safely protect these children against SARS-CoV-2, which is so important in our continued fight against COVID-19 and will be especially welcomed by parents and caregivers.""

Modern has filed FDA applications for older kids, but the FDA has not ruled on them and it remains unclear if that data will be under consideration.

Right now, only children ages 5 or older can be vaccinated in the U.S., using rival Pfizer’s vaccine.

216,"WHO, UNICEF warn about ‘perfect storm’ for measles in children","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) are warning communities about what they say is a ""perfect storm"" of conditions for measles outbreaks in children.

The agencies said that reported worldwide measles cases increased by 79% in the first two months of 2022, compared to the same time period last year.

WISCONSIN REPORTS FIRST DEATH IN US POSSIBLY LINKED TO PUZZLING HEPATITIS OUTBREAK IN CHILDREN

Almost 17,338 measles cases were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared with 9,665 during the first two months of 2021.

Countries with the largest outbreaks include Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Ethiopia.

There have been 21 large and disruptive outbreaks in the last 12 months, from April 2021 through April 2022, with most reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. That number is likely to be much higher than reported.

Africa recorded a 400% increase in measles, to more than 17,000 cases between January and March.

The WHO said the increase in cases is a ""worrying sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases and could trigger larger outbreaks"" that impact millions of children.

The agency noted that COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions, vaccine inequity and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving children without protection from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

The risk has been increased further by relaxed COVID-19 mitigation measures and displacement due to conflicts and crises.

COVID CASES DECLINE AGAIN LAST WEEK WORLDWIDE: WHO

""As measles is very contagious, cases tend to show up quickly when vaccination levels decline. The agencies are concerned that outbreaks of measles could also forewarn outbreaks of other diseases that do not spread as rapidly,"" it said.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted immunization services, health systems have been overwhelmed and we are now seeing a resurgence of deadly diseases including measles. For many other diseases, the impact of these disruptions to immunization services will be felt for decades to come,"" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said in a statement. ""Now is the moment to get essential immunization back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the measles virus spreads through the air and is very contagious.

It can also be serious, causing serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5.

About one in five people who get measles in the U.S. will be hospitalized, one out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling and one to three out of 1,000 will die – even with the best care.

The WHO notes that the measles virus weakens the immune system, making a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases for months after the infection.

Two doses of the measles vaccine can protect children against measles, but disruptions have delayed the introduction of the second dose of the measles vaccine in many countries.

219,'It woke me up!': Atmospheric 'lid' made for jarring thunder in New York,"NEW YORK -- The ""City that Never Sleeps"" can blame Mother Nature for making it literal Monday morning as several around New York City reported being jolted from bed due to unusually loud cracks of thunder.

""It woke me up -- it was extremely loud and lasted much longer than usual,"" said FOX Weather Meteorologist and Senior Weather Producer Greg Diamond. ""I'd estimate the loudest part lasted about 2-4 seconds and instead of the usual single loud crack of thunder sounds. There were multiple loud booms.""

US STRUCK BY 194 MILLION BOLTS OF LIGHTNING LAST YEAR

There were five cloud-to-ground lightning strikes measured in the Manhattan area, according to Chris Vagasky with Vaisala.

One of those bolts struck the top of the World Trade Center:

That's nothing new – Vagasky reports the WTC is struck by lightning about 109 times per year on average.

The reason for the figuratively ""super charged"" thunder was a temperature inversion sat over New York City. To those on the ground, the temperature was 51 degrees but up around 900 feet, the temperature had warmed to 54 degrees, instead of the usual cooling with height.

BACKWARDS BOLT: WATCH AS LIGHTNING HEADS SKYWARD FROM NYC'S WORLD TRADE CENTER

That inversion can trap sound waves near the surface, according to FOX Weather Meteorologist and Data Weather Specialist Shane Brown.

""Sound propagation can vary based on the temperature characteristics of the atmosphere near the point of origin,"" Brown said. ""In an environment where you have a shallow layer of cold air at the surface covered by warmer air aloft you can in a sense 'trap' the sound waves from refracting upwards. This leads to sound waves that tend to dissipate slower and can extend further in distance.""

220,Rocket Lab snatches rocket out of the sky using a helicopter on its first try,"After multiple days of uncooperative weather thwarted Rocket Lab's launch plans, the company launched a rocket and successfully caught it with a helicopter as it fell to Earth. The milestone moment was the first end-to-end test of this recovery technique.

Recovering rocket boosters and re-flying the hardware can save millions of dollars. SpaceX has been doing this for years, but the two companies have very different methods for landing their rocket boosters.

Electron launched from New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula just before 7 p.m. ET on the ""There and Back Again"" mission carrying 34 ride-sharing satellites to orbit.

AS HURRICANE SEASON NEARS, NASA IS LAUNCHING A FLEET OF TINY SATELLITES TO STUDY THE TROPICS

Rocket Lab's plan involved plucking a rocket booster out of the sky by catching it using a helicopter and parachute system. And the plan worked, on the company's first try.

After separation, the bottom half of the rocket began returning to Earth, performing a series of complex maneuvers to allow it to survey the extreme heat as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere. The rocket was traveling at almost 5,150 mph when it began its descent back to Earth.

A drogue parachute deployed from the booster about 7 minutes after liftoff, beginning to slow Electron down. Next, the main parachute deployed, slowing the booster down to about 22 mph to allow Rocket Lab's Sikorsky helicopter to catch the parachute.

There are only a few minutes in the recovery window for the helicopter to use a line and snag the parachute.

""We are all waiting on the edge of our seats,"" Rocket Lab communications representative Murielle Baker said.

The view from the chopper showed clouds and the line awaiting its catch for several minutes. Then, the orange and white parachute came into view and Rocket Lab declared that it had caught the booster.

""Helicopter catch!"" Rocket Lab tweeted after the parachute was seen on the helicopter's camera feed.

The helicopter was set to carry the booster to a nearby recovery vessel at sea. However, the pilot noticed different ""load characteristics"" than during tests and made the decision to drop the booster into the Pacific Ocean.

Baker said the booster remained in ""great condition"" and was picked up by the recovery ship.

""This is a monumental step forward in our program to make Electron a reusable vehicle,"" Baker said following the capture.

Rocket Lab pushed the launch date a few times due to weather. The company wanted to try on Friday and Sunday, but the weather was not in their favor both times.

""We don't usually give Mother Nature quite so much power over launch timing, but for our first helicopter catch attempt, we want to line up the best possible conditions to give us the highest chance of a successful catch,"" Rocket Lab tweeted last week. ""In time, we'll narrow those bounds.""

According to Rocket Lab Communications Director Morgan Bailey, the team is looking to avoid fog and low cloud cover to maximize visibility for the helicopter catch. Once the booster is caught by the helicopter, it will be offloaded to a boat at sea, which requires minimal wave height.

Rocket Lab mounted a camera on the booster and provided views from the rocket as it returned, but the feed quickly cut out.",http://www.foxweather.com/earth-space/after-weather-delays-rocket-lab-hopes-to-catch-a-rocket-returning-from-space

Officials say the fire is only 30% contained as of Monday morning, and at least 1,119 firefighters are working to control the blaze and extinguish the flames.

However, the region is currently under a critical risk of wildfires because of strong winds and extremely dry conditions across the state and Southwest.

A woman in Italy had her birthday cake ""returned"" nearly 77 years after World War II soldiers made off with the homemade treat.

The U.S. Army Garrison Italy replaced the cake Meri Mion lost in 1945 after the 88th Infantry Division battled German forces near her home in Vicenza, Italy, that spring, the garrison wrote in a news release.

At the time, Mion was 12 years old. She had been sheltering in the attic of her family’s farm in San Pietro in Gù, a small commune in northeastern Italy, located in the Province of Padua.

The battle concluded by the time her 13th birthday came around on April 29, 1945. Her mother reportedly baked her a cake to celebrate and set it on their window sill to cool off.

Unfortunately, Mion never got to taste the homemade cake her mother made. That's because ""resourceful American soldiers"" had taken the cake, according to Col. Matthew Gomlak, commander of U.S. Army Garrison Italy.

""Her happiness turned into disappointment,"" Gomlak said in a statement.

The U.S. Army Garrison Italy convened to replace the cake Mion lost all those years ago for her 90th birthday.

As college graduation season approaches this year, here's a smart reminder: A college degree is not for everyone.

In a culture in which higher education is often promoted as a must-have for everyone, some very well known and successful individuals (in an array of fields) decided to ditch the academics in their own lives — and wound up doing very well thanks to hard work, enormous drive and total passion for their interests.

These eight prominent Americans left college behind and made it big.

Some of the most famous college dropouts in America include household names — and some of them may surprise you.

Here's a look at eight prominent Americans who left college behind and made it big.

Rush Limbaugh

Radio talk show host and media dynamo Rush Limbaugh will always be remembered for his impressive career in political and cultural commentary and broadcasting — all achieved without a college degree.

FORMER VP PENCE NARRATES ‘AGE OF RUSH,’ A LOOK AT THE MAN BEHIND THE GOLDEN MICROPHONE

The native of Cape Girardeau, Mo., was known as shy growing up, but there was no doubt he had a passion for radio broadcasting.

In the Fox Nation four-part series ""Age of Rush,"" narrated by former Vice President Mike Pence, excerpts from Limbaugh’s past piece together his trajectory in radio fame.

""I knew I wanted to do radio when I was 12,"" he said in a 2012 interview. ""Because I hated school. And getting ready for school every morning, my mother had the radio on. That guy was having fun — and I was having drudgery.""

COLLEGE DEGREE DOESN'T MEAN MORE MONEY: AMERICA'S CAREER COACH

Limbaugh landed his first radio job as a disc jockey at a local station before he completed high school. After his graduation in 1969, Limbaugh attended Southwest Missouri State College — and then dropped out to get back on the air.

In 1973, Limbaugh found himself in front of the mic once again under the alias Jeff Christie.

It would be another decade before Limbaugh launched his career in political commentary, influenced by former President Ronald Reagan’s persuasive radio presence. Limbaugh himself then influenced scores of others in his field throughout his legendary career.

Tiger Woods

Inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame this year, golf icon Tiger Woods risked his college diploma for a chance to go pro.

Following a childhood in which he developed his love of the links, Woods attended Stanford University in 1994, where he played NCAA golf and studied economics.

Woods won a record-tying 11 tournaments between his freshman and sophomore years at Stanford, but that's exactly how long his college experience would last.

When Woods was offered the opportunity to join the PGA in 1996, he made the decision to withdraw from the university to pursue his pro career.

TIGER WOODS' 20 MOST INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES AND LIFE LESSONS

Since his professional debut, Woods, 46, has clenched 106 worldwide wins and 15 majors. The golfer also has 82 PGA Tour wins under his belt — and is tied with Sam Snead, one of the greatest players of all time, for the most wins.

Woods, most recently, is the 12th-highest paid professional athlete in the world, according to Forbes, earning $60 million in 2021 alone.

Bill Gates

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates may very well be considered the pioneer of the college-dropout-turned-billionaire trend.

Gates ditched his promising education at Harvard University in 1975 after his first two years as a pre-law student. He had discovered his immense potential in the tech space.

Today, Microsoft is one of the largest tech companies in the world.

As part of an undergrad combinatorics course, Gates developed an algorithm to address an unsolved problem — which held the record for speed for 30 years, according to Best Colleges.

The young student decided to take a leave of absence from the university to found software company Microsoft — today one of the largest tech companies in the world. As of April 2022, it has a more than $2.1 trillion market cap.

The multi-billionaire, 66, has since given back big-time through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which works with partner organizations around the world. In 2021, the Gates Foundation doubled the total amount of donations with $15 billion in allocations, according to The Conversation.

Alicia Keys

Award-winning musician and artist Alicia Keys has brains, beauty and singing ability — but pursuing academics wasn’t in her make-up.

Keys graduated early from New York’s Professional Performing Arts high school as valedictorian at only 16 years old. The musician went on to attend Columbia University.

Keys has won 15 Grammy Awards and sold more than 65 million records worldwide.

College life, however, was short-lived for her in the 1990s: The teenager ditched Columbia University for a record deal with Columbia Records after one semester, Variety reported.

Even though her deal with Columbia fell through, Keys, 41, was saved by producer Clive Davis and signed to Arista Records shortly after, producing her debut album ""Songs In A Minor"" in 2001.

The hit album featured notable songs like ""Fallin,’"" which spent six weeks at no. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. The soul singer went on to win 15 Grammy Awards and 9 Billboard Music Awards. She has sold more than 65 million records worldwide.

Rachael Ray

Celebrity chef Rachael Ray knows what to cook up in the kitchen — and doing so didn’t require a college education.

The popular chef, known for her 30-minute meals, first attended Pace University in 1986 to study literature and communications. After two years, Ray dropped out to save money and re-focus her career goals, according to Good Housekeeping.

Rachel Ray's first cookbook sold 10,000 copies in two weeks.

Ray, 53, began offering cooking classes at a gourmet grocery store in Albany, N.Y., fueled by her love of working with food, which turned into demonstrations on local TV. By 1999, her first cookbook sold 10,000 copies in two weeks.

After making soup during a snowy segment of ""The Today Show"" in 2001, Ray’s career hit the ground running and she landed a contract with the Food Network.

""Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home,"" she has said.

Ryan Seacrest

Media personality Ryan Seacrest, born in Atlanta, always knew a life in broadcasting was for him, no matter the sacrifice.

After interning at Atlanta FM radio station WSTR in high school, he enrolled in the University of Georgia to pursue journalism in 1992.

Two years later, the college junior gave his first ""Seacrest, out!"" to college life and moved to Los Angeles. There, he fronted KYSR-FM’s afternoon drive-time show called ""Ryan Seacrest for the Ride Home.""

Ryan Seacrest’s higher education pursuit finally came full circle when he earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Georgia in 2016.

Seacrest’s emergence into the national limelight was arguably his 2002 debut as co-host of the TV singing competition ""American Idol.""

The emcee, 47, still hosts the program today — and has added to his on-screen repertoire. He took over the hosting of such iconic specials as ""Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.""

Seacrest’s higher education pursuit finally came full circle when he earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Georgia in 2016 after delivering the school’s commencement address that year.

Lady Gaga

Native New Yorker Lady Gaga, born and raised as Stefani Germanotta, always recognized her calling toward stardom.

The pop star grew up experiencing ridicule by her peers, but her passion for music fueled her fire to make it big. At the age of 11, Gaga began studying with Christina Aguilera’s vocal coach Don Lawrence and continued to practice classical piano and acting as a kid, Mic reported.

After graduating from high school, Gaga sought out an education at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. But it didn’t last long.

Gaga’s first album, ""The Fame,"" topped the charts, with tracks like ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"" hitting no. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100.

At 19 years old, the future star abandoned that life and dropped out of NYU to pursue her dreams. ""I left my entire family, got the cheapest apartment I could find and ate s--- until somebody would listen,"" she told New York Magazine in a 2010 interview.

After she was signed and then dropped by Def Jam records, Gaga was discovered by R&B artist Akon — who signed her to his own label in 2008.

Gaga’s first album, ""The Fame,"" topped the charts, with tracks like ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"" hitting no. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100.

LADY GAGA'S GREAT KINDNESS TOWARD LIZA MINNELLI: ETIQUETTE EXPERT SAID WE'VE OVERLOOKED IT

Gaga, 36, has won numerous awards and accolades during her career; was ranked fourth on VH1's Greatest Women in Music (2012); and was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in both 2010 and 2019.

John Mayer

There may be a running joke about the frequency of music school dropouts, but John Mayer, 44, turned the stigma into a success.

Mayer, who grew up in Fairfield, Connecticut, enrolled in Boston’s Berklee College of Music in 1998 but soon realized school wasn’t really his style.

In a 2002 interview with MTV, Mayer said his grades at Berklee ""were pronounced like ‘d-d-d-f-f-f-f-f’ — like static,"" as he had less professional training than his classmates.

The singer left the competitive music school and moved to Atlanta to pursue a solo career.

Three years later, he released his debut album, ""Room for Squares."" He won a Grammy Award in 2003 for the chart-topping hit ""Your Body Is a Wonderland.""

231,Pennsylvania mother arrested after allegedly shooting her two sons in the head: police,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A Pennsylvania woman allegedly shot her two sons in the head at their home on Monday morning before attempting to shoot her neighbor and fleeing the scene, Bucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub said.

Trinh Nguyen, 38, was arrested hours later in a church parking lot and had apparently tried to commit suicide.

Authorities were originally called to Nguyen's home in Upper Makefield Township, Pennsylvania, around 7:00 a.m. on reports of an armed subject.

A 22-year-old neighbor told officers that Nguyen approached and asked him to give a box of photos to her ex-husband, then attempted to fire a black revolver at his face twice, but the gun did not fire.

The neighbor was able to disarm Nguyen, who then jumped in a white Toyota Sienna minivan and fled the area.

One of the officers then entered the home with a neighbor and found her two sons, ages 13 and 9, in their beds with gunshot wounds to their heads.

The two boys are not expected to survive.

""Both children will give the gift of life to others as their organs will be transplanted,"" Weintraub said at a press conference. ""It's a terrible tragedy, but perhaps some good can come out of this yet.""

Nguyen is facing three counts of attempted homicide and one count of possession of an instrument of crime. Once her sons are pronounced deceased, two of those counts will be upgraded to homicide.

She was found in the parking lot of United Methodist Church in Washington’s Crossing around 11:30 a.m., about three miles from her home.

Weintraub said that she was ""under the influence"" and authorities believe she tried to commit suicide.

232,"Missing Alabama prison official had sold home, was expected to retire before murder suspect escaped","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

An escaped Alabama murder suspect is on the run, possibly armed and dangerous, as a top official at the jail who colleagues expected to retire has been linked to the jailbreak, according to the local sheriff.

Casey Cole White, 38 and Vicky White, 56, were last seen Friday morning on surveillance video ditching a marked vehicle at a parking lot on Florence, Alabama, about 70 miles west of Huntsville, according to authorities.

The two are not related, according to investigators.

ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR MISSING ALABAMA CORRECTIONS OFFICER IN MURDER SUSPECT'S ESCAPE

Vicky White is the assistant director of corrections at the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence. She sold her home about a month ago, according to Lauderdale Sheriff Rick Singleton, and had talked about relocating to the beach for months.

""Everybody thought she was gonna retire,"" he said during a Monday news briefing. ""Nobody saw this coming.""

Authorities announced a warrant for Vicky White Monday, even as the sheriff said her alleged assistance may have been coerced.

""To do it willingly would be so out of character for the Vicky White we all know,"" he said.

They took off in a law enforcement vehicle and the sheriff’s office later recovered abandoned in a parking lot.

She allegedly told colleagues she was going to take the prisoner to the county courthouse for an evaluation and planned to stop at a doctor’s office afterward, saying she didn’t feel well. There was no scheduled evaluation, according to the sheriff.

Authorities thought Vicky White came to work that day to serve her last day before retiring, Singleton said. But she hadn’t yet cleared all of the bureaucratic hurdles.

""I think from the sale of the house, she possibly had access to some cash,"" he said. ""The retirement papers were never sent into the state retirement system. She had to have a conference with the personnel director before that could happen.""

Casey White was serving an unrelated, 75-year prison sentence when he confessed to killing 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway in 2015. He subsequently pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Singleton issued a warning Monday that the escaped prisoner should be considered ""extremely dangerous"" and that any law enforcement officers who come across him should not take ""any chances.""

ALABAMA INMATE, OFFICER MISSING AFTER EXPECTED COURT APPEARANCE

The jailbreak has drawn comparisons to the 2015 escape from the Clinton Correction Facility in Dannemora, New York, during which a prison tailor there flirted with two convicted killers before allegedly helping them break out.

Seth Ferranti, an ex-con turned writer and filmmaker who was an extra on Showtime’s ""Escape at Dannemora"" series, told Fox News Digital that Casey White may have seduced the prison official and said the cases seemed ""very similar"" at first glance.

""Cons are notorious for doing long plays and being super manipulative, but maybe it’s true love,"" he said.

According to the sheriff, Casey White had previously plotted an escape attempt from the county jail in late 2020.

His alleged plan was to take a hostage and break out of the facility on the day of his arraignment, before he was scheduled to transfer back to state prison. Officers caught him in possession of a ""shank,"" or prison knife, and safely transferred him back to prison.

He again returned to the county jail in February of this year.

Casey White faces a possible death penalty if convicted in Ridgeway’s death.

""He has nothing to lose with his violent past,"" Singleton said. ""He is extremely dangerous.""

Both Whites may be armed, according to authorities.

235,Can Democrats Avoid A 2022 ‘Blood Bath’?,"With the 2022 midterms approaching, Democrats are grappling with increasing expectations that their party will suffer major losses. Republicans are seeking to take back control of Congress in November as President Biden’s recent approval ratings hit 33 percent with voter support waning on key issues like rising inflation, crime, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

So are Democrats going to suffer, what one New York Times writer called a ‘Blood Bath’?

This past week, host Jessica Rosenthal spoke to Republican strategist and former Campaign Manager for Senator Scott Brown, Colin Reed, and Democratic pollster and CEO of Schoen Cooperman Research, Carly Cooperman about their expectations for the 2022 midterms.

They discussed how President Biden’s popularity would impact the party, what’s behind the enthusiasm gap, and why Republicans should not necessarily assume a ‘red wave’ is inevitable.

Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the conversation in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the entire discussions with GOP stratergist Colin Reed and Democratic pollster Carly Cooperman and hear more of their perspective on the 2022 midterms and what both parties must focus on to win as many races as possible.",https://radio.foxnews.com/2022/04/24/the-fox-news-rundown-4-23-2022/

Oz said there is no end to the controlling desire of Fauci and other unelected mid-level bureaucrats who are suffocating medicine.

Dr. Oz also discussed the Axios report that everyone attending the Washington Correspondents Dinner must be tested and prove they are vaccinated, except the members of the Washington Hilton’s hospitality workers union. Oz says Covid testing has turned into political theater and virtue signaling because they don’t care about Covid safety.

Then last year, Reilly said there was about 9,900 recorded black murders. The effect of the Black Lives Matter movement has accounted for a jump of 63 % in black fatal homicides and Reilly calls out people like Ben Crump for drastically over inflating the number of unarmed black men shot by the police for fueling the BLM movement. Reilly also spoke about how Critical Race theory is nothing like the Civil Rights movement. Reilly believes most people, regardless of race and class truly want to help one another and it is CRT and BLM that are saying that if a white person wants to help the poor they are doing it for some crooked, manipulative reason.",https://radio.foxnews.com/2022/04/20/wilfred-reilly-black-lives-matter-has-led-to-a-63-jump-in-black-fatal-homicides/

“The only reason there is any kind of order in places like Del Rio or McAllen is because the Texas National Guard and the Texas DPS have been deployed as part of Operation Lone Star, which is this partnership to cut down on illegal traffic and to try and do what they can at the state level to build fences with concertina wire, with razor wire on private ranches, what they can do to prosecute these illegal immigrants for criminal trespassing when they are caught, and patrolling the Rio Grande when they can to prevent smugglers from bringing people across. And it’s just interesting when you go down there and you see all this in action and you are again reminded that the will to secure the border, it can be done. If Texas is able as a state to deploy that many resources to get this job done, there is no excuse for the federal government, which has endless resources, not to do this. And of course, we saw that it can be done under Trump. But no, it’s an abject lie that the border is under control.”

Senior correspondent Laura Ingle hosts this multi-part Fox Nation Audio podcast that examines the unsolved murder mystery of the more than ten people, many of them sex workers, found on Long Island.

On a December morning more than a decade ago, a police dog stumbled across a set of female human remains on the south shore of Long Island, New York, along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach. Law enforcement soon discovered the remains of three more women, stuffed in burlap bags found in thick bramble off a stretch of highway.

Months later, the body of 24-year-old sex worker Shannan Gilbert was also discovered near Oak Beach, not far from the “Gilgo Four,”. Also found were the dismembered remains of other women, a man dressed in female clothing, and a toddler, scattered in various locations throughout Long Island. Investigators announced that a serial killer (or killers) was to blame for the murders. But to this day, no suspects have been publicly named and no arrests have been made in a case that shook a quiet, sleepy beach town to its core, and captivated the nation.

In this Fox Nation series/Fox Audio podcast, produced by Fox News’ Investigative Unit, find out what law enforcement is currently doing to solve the case using new technology. You’ll learn new details from a former escort who believes she spoke with the Long Island serial killer.

“Some of our reporters have been going through the briefing that Mayorkas gave them yesterday about how he plans to handle the influx of migrants if Title 42 goes away in a month. And what he says is that they’re effectively managing the border. And I think from their perspective, they are, because they believe the processing of illegals is going more smoothly than it ever has before. Now, understand what I just said. They’re not trying to prevent people from crossing the border. They’re trying to make it easier and faster in the processing size. So what he is saying is that if it goes to 18,000 a day, we can handle it because of the plan we will have in place. And that’s how he defines effective management.”

Congresswomen Miller-Meeks discussed the absurdity of continuing to mask children by saying,

“I just had the opportunity to get testimony from Secretary Becerra at the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Task Force and Education Labor. And we asked him this very question Why are they mandating that children and Headstart programs wear masks when we’re in the endemic evade the mask, especially masks, and children probably have very little effectiveness and their vaccination status is really not relevant because they’re extremely low risk of disease or death. So given that, why are we still and I did legislation’s on this co-sponsored them why are we continuing to mandate that children are the ones that are the most the most likely to survive or not get ill? Why are we continuing to require they wear a mask? There is no there is no good science or recommendation for that. Children should be able to go back to school.”

Chika was vibrant, full of life, fun and laughter. Even at her young age she possessed incredible wisdom. For Albom, it was Chika’s death that brought a more poignant awareness of how precious life is.

Fox Nation Terms of Use Agreement

Effective Date: 1/25/2022

PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS OF USE, ALONG WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY AND OTHER POLICIES OR AGREEMENTS REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS OF USE, BEFORE USING THE “FOX NATION SERVICES” (AS DEFINED BELOW). PLEASE NOTE THAT THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” IN SECTION 13 BELOW CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS: (i) ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND FOX UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT IN COURT AND (ii) YOU AND FOX WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPUTES. PLEASE CLICK HERE TO REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. BY USING FOX NATION SERVICES, YOU UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

Description of Service and Acceptance of Terms

Fox News Network, LLC (“Fox,” “we” or “us”) has developed this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) to describe the terms that govern your use of the Fox Nation Services (defined below). Fox is based in the United States.

Fox Nation is an online video service which gives users the opportunity to select from various offerings of on-demand and streaming news programming, including television shows, clips, and other content (collectively, the ""Content""). Our video service, the Content, our player for viewing the Content (the ""Video Player"") and any other products, features, tools, materials, or other services (including third party branded services) offered from time to time by Fox on or through a variety of “Access Points” (defined below) are referred to collectively as the “Fox Nation Services” or “the Services.” The term ""Access Points"" refers to, collectively, the Fox Nation website, applications and other places where any of the Services are authorized by Fox or a Fox “Affiliate” (defined below) to be made available, including websites and applications of our third party distribution partners (for example, digital distribution platforms) and other websites where users or website operators are permitted to embed or have otherwise licensed the Video Player. Fox may also use third-party service providers, such as payment processors, vendors, contractors, agents or sponsors, to operate, develop or help manage and/or provide the Fox Nation Services.

Your use of the Fox Nation Services (including access to the Content) is conditioned on your compliance with this Agreement, which incorporates by reference our Privacy Policy (""Privacy Policy"") and any end user license agreement that might accompany the Services. Your use of certain products offered through the Fox Nation Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions that apply to those products in addition to this Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between those additional terms and this Agreement, those additional terms will prevail with respect to your use of that particular product.

Fox furnishes the Fox Nation Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment. By using the Fox Nation Services (whether or not you have an account or subscription) or by clicking a box that states that you accept and agree to this Agreement, you signify your unconditional agreement to be bound by this Agreement, including any future modifications, and to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations (“Applicable Law”). Please read through this Agreement carefully. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by Applicable Law, you may not use the Fox Nation Services and must discontinue use of the Fox Nation Services immediately. Your use of the Fox Nation Services is subject to your continued compliance with this Agreement.

Please note that the website addresses (i.e., URLs) included within this Agreement may not function as hyperlinks on all the Access Points. To view this Agreement with clickable hyperlinks, please click here.

Changes to This Agreement

We may need to make changes to this Agreement from time to time for many reasons. For example, we may need to reflect updates in how the Services work or changes in the law. You should look at this Agreement regularly. It is posted on the Fox Nation website here. In addition, you can access this Agreement when you are logged into Fox Nation Services. If we make a material change to this Agreement, we may notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided to us prior to the material change taking effect. Therefore, it is important that you keep your account information, including email address, updated. Any material change to this Agreement will be effective automatically 10 days after the revised Agreement is first posted or, for users who register or otherwise provide opt-in consent during this 10-day period, at the time of registration or consent, as applicable, unless the law requires us to make the change effective sooner.

Your continued use of the Fox Nation Services following any modification constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by this Agreement as so modified.

Access and Use of the Services

3.1 Personal Use Only. The Fox Nation Services are intended solely for your personal and non-commercial use. Fox may change, suspend or discontinue the Fox Nation Services, in whole or in part, at any time. Fox may also impose limits on certain features and services offered on the Fox Nation Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Fox Nation Services without notice or liability. You acknowledge that from time to time the Fox Nation Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) equipment malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs which Fox may undertake from time to time; or (iii) causes beyond the control of Fox or which are not reasonably foreseeable by Fox.

3.2 Age Limitations. The Fox Nation Services are not intended to be used by children without involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to register with Fox or provide your personal information to Fox. If you are at least 13 and under 18 years of age (or under the applicable age of majority in your state or territory of residence), you may register with the Fox Nation Services only if you have the consent of your parent or guardian, including consent to this Agreement on your behalf. If you subscribe to Fox and wish to create subprofiles (if available) under your subscription, you must ensure all users of such subprofiles are 18 years of age or older (or the applicable age of majority in your state or territory of residence).

3.3 Your License. Fox grants you a non-exclusive limited license to use the Services, including accessing and privately viewing the Content on a streaming, temporary download (if available), or other bases through the Video Player, for personal, non-commercial purposes only as set forth in this Agreement. The periods during which you can view each piece of Content will vary based on the rights available for such Content and the terms of your subscription. You shall not interfere (or permit the use of your subscription by a third party to interfere) or attempt to interfere with the operation or use of Fox Nation Services by other members in any way through any means or device including, but not limited to, spamming, hacking, uploading computer viruses or time bombs, or any other means expressly prohibited by any provision of this Agreement. You understand that some of the Content that is available on the Services may be protected by security technology, and you agree not to circumvent, disable, disassemble, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or otherwise tamper with such security technology. Fox may, in its sole discretion, and at any time, with or without notice, suspend, disable or terminate your subscription (free or paid), and/or access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without prior notice, for any reason or no reason at all, without liability. If we disable your subscription, you agree that you will not create another one or otherwise try to access the Services without our permission. You agree not to sell, transfer or assign your subscription or any subscription rights.

3.4 The Content

Content Subjectivity. Content tends to elicit varying reactions among different people. As is true for many websites and content platforms, you may come across Content that you find offensive, indecent, explicit or objectionable. Also, Content types, genres, categories, and descriptions are provided as suggestions to help with navigation, and Fox does not guarantee that you will agree with them. You acknowledge and voluntarily accept these risks.

Content Quality. Fox uses various technologies to provide you with an optimal viewing experience. That said, quality of Content, including resolution, may be affected by the format of the Content, your location, the speed and bandwidth of your internet service, and the devices used, among other factors. HD and 4K Ultra HD availability for certain Content depends on your internet service and device capabilities. The time it takes you to begin playing Content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, internet bandwidth, the number of devices simultaneously connecting to the same network, the Content you have selected, and the configuration of the device you are using. As a result, Fox is unable to make any warranties about the Content in these respects.

3.5 Limited Content License. The Fox Nation Services contain information, text, files, images, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, materials, applications, software, product names, company names, trade names, logos, designs, and any other materials or content of Fox and/or its parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates (“Fox Affiliates”) and their licensors and assignors (collectively, the ""Fox Content""), and it may contain materials and Content provided by users (“User Content”) or other third-parties. Fox Content contained in the Fox Nation Services is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws and, as between you and Fox, its licensors, or its assignors, Fox or Fox Affiliates owns and retains all rights in and to the Fox Content and Fox Nation Services. Fox hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable, nontransferable license, to access and privately display or perform the Fox Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal, non-commercial use, in connection with using the Fox Nation Services. Except as provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, download, stream capture, reproduce, duplicate, archive, upload, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, retransmit, distribute, perform, display, sell, frame or deep-link, make available or otherwise use any Content contained in or through the Fox Nation Services.

Except as explicitly and expressly permitted by Fox or by the limited license set forth above, you are strictly prohibited from creating works or materials (including but not limited to fonts, icons, link buttons, wallpaper, desktop themes, on-line postcards, montages, mash-ups and similar videos, greeting cards and unlicensed merchandise) that derive from or are based on the Fox Content. This prohibition applies regardless of whether such derivative works or materials are sold, bartered or given away. In addition, you may not, either directly or through the use of any device, software, internet site, web-based service or other means, remove, alter, bypass, avoid, interfere with, or circumvent any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notice marked on the Fox Content contained in the Fox Nation Services or any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection, copy control, or access control measure associated with the Fox Content, including geo-filtering mechanisms. Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, you are expressly prohibited from using any Fox Content and/or the Services in any manner.

You may not, without Fox’s written permission, “mirror” any Fox or User Content contained on the Fox Nation Services or any other server. You may not use the Fox Nation Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by the Agreement. You may not use the Fox Nation Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair Fox, the Fox Nation Services, Access Points, or otherwise interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Fox Nation Services. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Fox Nation Services through hacking, password mining or any other means. Fox reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Fox Nation Services, or any portion thereof, at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all, without prior notice or any notice.

3.6 The Video Player. You may not modify, enhance, remove, interfere with, or otherwise alter in any way any portion of the Video Player, its underlying technology, any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure incorporated into the Video Player. This restriction includes, without limitation, disabling, reverse engineering, modifying, interfering with or otherwise circumventing the Video Player in any manner that enables users to view the Content without: (i) displaying visibly both the Video Player and all surrounding elements (including the graphical user interface, any advertising, copyright notices, and trademarks) of the Access Point where the Video Player is located; and (ii) having full access to all functionality of the Video Player, including, without limitation, all video quality and display functionality and all interactive, elective, or click-through advertising functionality.

3.7 Embedding a Video Using the Video Player. Where Fox has incorporated an embed option in connection with Content on the Fox Nation Services, you may embed videos using the Video Player, provided you do not embed the Video Player on any website or other location that (i) contains or hosts content that is unlawful, infringing, pornographic, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, vulgar, indecent, profane, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, encourages criminal conduct, gives rise to civil liability, violates any law, rule, or regulation, infringes any right of any third party including intellectual property rights, or is otherwise inappropriate or objectionable to Fox (in Fox's sole discretion), or (ii) links to infringing or unauthorized content (collectively, ""Unsuitable Material""). You may not embed the Video Player into any hardware or software application, even for non-commercial purposes. Fox reserves the right to prevent embedding to any website or other location that Fox finds inappropriate or objectionable (as determined by Fox in its sole discretion).

3.8 Compatible Devices. In order to access the Services, you will need to use a computer, mobile device, streaming media player, or other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements that we establish from time to time (each, a “Compatible Device”). Features and functionalities that we make available through the Services may differ by Compatible Device. Please click here for a current list of Compatible Devices.

3.9 Internet Service and Data Usage. In order to access the Services, you must have a high-speed broadband, wireless or similar internet connection from an internet service provider that meets certain technical specifications. Please note that some features of the Services may require higher internet bandwidth. You are responsible for any costs associated with your internet service used to access the Services. Your use of the Services may count toward your data usage, depending on the terms of your agreement with your internet service provider.

3.10 Ownership. You agree that Fox owns and retains all rights to the Services. You further agree that the Content you access and view as part of the Services is owned, licensed and/or controlled by Fox. The Services and the Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. Nothing contained in this Agreement or on the Services should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Content in any manner not expressly contemplated herein without the prior written consent of Fox or such third party that may own the Content or intellectual property displayed on the Services. UNAUTHORIZED USE, COPYING, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION, PUBLICATION, REPUBLICATION, UPLOADING, FRAMING, DOWNLOADING, POSTING, TRANSMITTING, DISTRIBUTING, DUPLICATING OR ANY OTHER MISUSE OF ANY OF THE CONTENT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. Any use of the Content other than as permitted by this Agreement will violate this Agreement and may infringe upon our rights or the rights of the third party that owns the affected Content. You agree to report any violation of this Agreement by others that you become aware of. You are advised that Fox will aggressively enforce its rights to the fullest extent of the law.

3.11 No Spam/Unsolicited Communications and Submissions. You may not use the Fox Nation Services to harvest information about users for the purpose of sending, or to facilitate or encourage the sending of, unsolicited bulk or other communications. You understand that we may employ technical measures to prevent spam or unsolicited bulk or other communications from entering, utilizing, or remaining within our computer or communications networks. If you send spam, advertising, or other unsolicited communications of any kind through the Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to Fox and that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to measure. As a reasonable estimation of such harm, and by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty, you agree to pay Fox $50 for each actual or intended recipient of such communication.

Fox does not knowingly accept, via the Fox Nation Services or otherwise, unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions by you of blog ideas, articles, scripts, story lines, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, proposals, ideas or concepts. Fox requests that you do not make any unsolicited submissions. Any similarity between an unsolicited submission and any elements in any Fox or Fox Affiliate creative work, including without limitation, a film, series, story, title or concept would be purely coincidental. If you do send any submissions to Fox via the Fox Nation Services that are unsolicited (including but not limited to any Fox message board or forum), however, you agree that (i) your unsolicited submissions are not being made in confidence or trust and that by making such submissions, no contractual or fiduciary relationship is created between you and Fox; (ii) any such unsolicited submissions and copyright becomes the property of and will be owned by Fox (and are not User Content licensed by you to Fox under “Your Proprietary Rights in and License to Your User Content”) and may be used, copied, sublicensed, adapted, transmitted, distributed, publicly performed, published, displayed or deleted as Fox sees fit; (iii) you are not entitled to any compensation, credit or notice whatsoever in connection with such unsolicited submissions; and (iv) by sending an unsolicited submission, you waive the right to make any claim against Fox or Fox Affiliates relating to any unsolicited submissions by you, including, without limitation, unfair competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality.

3.12 Software Downloads. In order to participate in the Fox Nation Services or access certain Content, you may be notified that it is necessary to download software or other materials or agree to additional terms and conditions. Unless otherwise provided by these additional terms and conditions, they are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

3.13 Modification/Suspension/Discontinuation. We regularly make changes to the Fox Nation Services. The availability of the Content, as well as Access Points and Compatible Devices through which the Services are available, will change from time to time. The composition of the Content library and other Content offered at the time you register for the Service may not reflect the Content library that will be offered throughout your subscription and should not be relied upon. Fox reserves the right to replace or remove any Content and Access Points available to you through the Services, including specific titles and networks/channels, and to otherwise make changes in how we operate the Services. Additionally, you agree that for various reasons, such as restrictions from content programmers and other limitations or considerations from third parties, certain Content that may be available through one Access Point may not be available through another Access Point. We hope not to, but we may change, suspend, or discontinue - temporarily or permanently - some or all of the Services (including the Content and the Compatible Devices through which the Services are accessed), with respect to any or all users, at any time without notice. In our continued assessment of the Services, we may from time to time, with respect to any or all of our users, experiment with or otherwise offer certain features or other elements of the Services, including but not limited to promotional features, user interfaces, plans, pricing, in-application purchases, enhanced display resolution, and advertisements. You acknowledge that Fox may do so in Fox's sole discretion at any time without notice. You also agree that Fox will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services, although if you are a Fox Nation Services subscriber and Fox suspends or discontinues your subscription to the Fox Nation Services without cause, then as your sole and exclusive remedy Fox may, in its sole discretion, provide you with a credit, discount or other form of consideration (for example, we may credit additional days of service to your account) in accordance with Section 4 below. However, if Fox terminates your Fox Nation Services subscription or suspends or discontinues your access to the Fox Nation Services due to your violation of this Agreement, then you will not be eligible for any such credit, discount or other consideration.

3.14 Customer Service. If we can be of help to you, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service department by clicking here. We aim to deliver first-class customer service, but in the unlikely event that a customer service representative provides information that is inconsistent with this Agreement, please be aware that this Agreement will control.

Subscriptions and Billing

The information below applies only to consumers who subscribe to Fox Nation Services through Fox. We may require you to create an account in order to access the Fox Nation Services. Only the account holder, and those with permission from the account holder, may create an account. If you made a purchase from one of our third party partners, please contact the respective party for information about billing. Also be aware that, for your convenience, your “Payment Method” (as defined below) may be accessible on Fox Affiliate websites or services where you may elect to use the same Payment Method in order to process your transaction with any such Fox Affiliate.

4.1 Subscriptions. We charge a subscription fee to access the Fox Nation Services. You can find the specific details regarding your subscription at any time by logging in to Fox Nation Services and viewing your subscription details. Because the Services are offered in multiple time zones, for consistency, a “day” for purposes of this Agreement begins at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time and ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time of that same calendar day. Subscription fees are non-refundable. If you are a member of the Fox News Founders Program, then after your original subscription expires, it will automatically renew for additional one-year periods at the then-current rates, unless you cancel before the renewal. If you are not a member of the Fox News Founders Program, then after your original subscription expires, it will automatically renew for additional periods equal in length to the original subscription period, unless you cancel before the renewal, and the cost of the renewal will be at the then-current rates. If you don't want your subscription to renew, you can cancel it before the renewal by logging into your account and following the cancellation instructions that are provided. If you cancel your subscription, you will still have access to the Fox Nation Services for the remainder of time you have already paid for.

4.2 Billing. By providing a credit card or other payment method for your subscription to the Fox Nation Services (""Payment Method""), you are expressly agreeing that we or an independent third-party selected by, but not affiliated with, us (the “Payment Service”) are authorized to charge you a periodic subscription fee on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your subscription, any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of your subscription to the Payment Method. If you want to use a Payment Method that is different from the one you used during registration, or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by logging in on the Fox Nation Services and viewing your subscription details. When you provide a Payment Method to access a subscription, including in connection with a free trial offer, our Payment Service will attempt to verify the information you entered. The Payment Service will do this by processing an authorization hold, which is a standard practice. If your Payment Method expires and you do not update your Payment Method information or duly cancel your subscription before it automatically renews, you authorize the Payment Service to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. From time to time, our Payment Service may update your Payment Method using information from the financial institution providing your Payment Method. The collection and processing of your Payment Method for the Fox News Services shall be governed by the terms of use/service and privacy policy(ies) of our Payment Service. Please also be aware that some Payment Methods may not be eligible for certain Payment Service features and functionality, including any automatic Payment Method by our Payment Service providers. If we are unable to obtain a valid Payment Method, we may, at our discretion, suspend and/or cancel your subscription and access to the Fox Nation Services without further notice.

As used in this Agreement, ""billing"" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription or expiration of your free trial period, if any, whichever is earlier, and in connection with every automatic renewal thereafter, unless and until you duly cancel your subscription or the Services are otherwise discontinued pursuant to this Agreement.

The Payment Service will automatically bill your Payment Method when on or about the same calendar day corresponding to your subscription cycle. For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription that begins on January 10, the Payment Service will bill your Payment Method January 10, February 10, March 10, and so on each month, unless and until you duly cancel your subscription. For subscribers whose subscription starts with a free trial, billing will commence upon the expiration of the free trial and continue monthly as set forth above. The interval of time between each payment due date shall correspond to the term of your subscription and be referred to herein as a ""Billing Period."" However, if your subscription commences on the 29th, 30th, or 31st in a given month, your Payment Method will be charged on the first day of the following month. For example, if you purchase your subscription on October 31, your Payment Method will be charged for the following month on November 1. You acknowledge that the timing of when you are billed and the amount billed each Billing Period may vary, including for example due to free trials and other promotional offers, credits applied, changes in your subscription, changes in your Payment Method, and changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us or the Payment Service to charge your Payment Method for the corresponding amounts.

We receive updated payment card account status from the payment card issuer of certain participating payment card providers (specifically, whether payment card account number is updated or replaced). Not all entities authorized to issue payment cards participate in such disclosure of information. Please contact your payment card issuer for further information.

If we or a Fox Affiliate offer you a promotion (e.g., a promotional price) for your subscription, the specific terms of the promotion will be disclosed during your sign-up or in other materials provided to you describing the particular promotion. In the case of promotional pricing, after your promotion ends, the Payment Service will begin billing your Payment Method for your subscription at the regular price after your promotion ends unless you duly cancel prior to the end of your promotion or unless otherwise disclosed in communications made available to you.

Fox reserves the right to change the terms of your Fox Nation Services subscription, including price, from time to time, effective as of the beginning of your next Billing Period following the date of the change. If Fox changes the subscription fee or other charges for your Fox Nation Services subscription, we will give you advance notice of these changes and you will have the opportunity to cancel your subscription prior to incurring the new charges. However, we will not be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes.

Very rarely, if there are special circumstances where Fox determines it is appropriate (e.g., your access to the Services is unavailable for days due to technical difficulties), we may provide credits to affected subscribers. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at Fox's sole and absolute discretion, and the provision of credits in one instance does not entitle anyone to credits or in the future under similar or different circumstances.

4.3 Ongoing Subscription. Your subscription will continue in effect unless and until you duly cancel your subscription or the account or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to this Agreement. You must cancel your subscription before your next payment date in order to avoid the next billing. The Payment Service will bill the renewal subscription fee plus any applicable taxes to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). If you duly cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Billing Period. This means that you will have continued access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund. You will also forfeit any service or referral credits upon cancellation. PAYMENTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY-USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS.

4.4 HOW TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION

IF YOU PURCHASED FOX NATION SERVICES THROUGH US, YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BY SIGNING INTO YOUR FOX NATION ACCOUNT AND FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CANCELING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IF YOU NO LONGER WISH TO RECEIVE THE FOR NATION SERVICES.

IF YOU PAY FOR THE FOX NATION SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT WITH A THIRD PARTY (E.G., DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION PLATFORMS) AND WANT TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR MANAGE YOUR BILLING, YOU NEED TO DO SO THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY. FOX WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE RETURN OF ANY AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE FOX NATION SERVICES.

4.5 Unpaid Amounts. It is important that each subscriber honor the payment obligations to which the subscriber agreed. Accordingly, we reserve the right to permit the Payment Service to retry billing your Payment Method after failed attempts (e.g., if your Payment Method is rejected). We also reserve the right to permit the Payment Service or another third party to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your subscription. You will remain liable for all such amounts and all costs incurred in connection with the collection of these amounts, including, without limitation, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration or court costs.

4.6 Free Trials. On occasion, we may offer free trials to Fox Nation Services for certain qualifying users. If we offer you a free trial, the specific terms of your free trial will be stated in the material describing the particular free trial or during your sign-up. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining free trials with any other offers. Fox reserves the right to determine eligibility for free trials.

Once your free trial period ends, the Payment Service will begin billing your Payment Method for your subscription fees (plus any applicable taxes), unless you duly cancel prior to the end of your free trial. For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you will be asked to set up a valid Payment Method when redeeming a free trial offer.

You will not receive a notice from Fox that your free Fox Nation Services trial has ended and that payment for your subscription is due. If you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must duly cancel your subscription prior to midnight Eastern Time on the last day of your free trial period. You may cancel your subscription at any time as described in the ""Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation"" section of this Agreement.

In addition, the third-party providing the Third-Party Service may use other parties to provide portions of the apps or service to you, such as technology, development or payment services.

Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver

(1) Fox, including its Fox Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any Dispute (as defined herein) between you and Fox, regarding any aspect of your relationship with Fox, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court. Each of you and Fox agrees to give up the right to sue in court.

(2) The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and Fox, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term “Dispute” specifically includes, but is not limited to, any disputes, actions, claims, or controversies between you and the Fox that arise from or in any way relate to or concern any Content, products or services provided by Fox including but not limited to the Fox Services (as defined above), this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and Fox retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and Fox may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator.

(3) Each of you and Fox also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and Fox (see paragraph 9 below).

(4) There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages); provided that they are recoverable under these Terms of Use.

(5) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of the Terms of Use.

(6) Any arbitration between you and Fox will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and Fox cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules, with the participation and involvement of Fox and you pursuant to JAMS Rule 12. The JAMS Rules are available on its website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Use.

(7) If either you or Fox wish to arbitrate a claim, you or Fox must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Fox Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested. Your Notice to the Fox must be sent by mail to: Arbitration Notice of Dispute, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90067. Fox will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide. It is the sender’s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice. During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.

(8) If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found at http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf. In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to the Fox at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.

(9) You and the Fox acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration:

(a) YOU AND FOX MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) Fox will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 6 below; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law and these Terms of Use; and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 10 below.

(10) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations. Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against Fox, you and the Fox acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:

If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), Fox will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.

If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but Fox will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.

Fox and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. Fox will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000. This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.

Fox and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.

(11) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and Fox shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.

(12) Each of you and Fox may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys’ fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if Fox failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than Fox’s highest settlement offer, then Fox will pay your reasonable attorneys’ fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded. If Fox wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees. In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides’ arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.

(13) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim, only as permitted by applicable law, and only to the extent that declaratory and injunctive relief are permitted by these Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages or any other relief not allowed under this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator also may not order Fox to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Fox explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order. Further, unless Fox expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.

(14) You and Fox agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order. In keeping with the confidential nature of the arbitration, You and Fox agree that an order confirming award is only necessary if the obligations of the award have not been performed. Therefore, before taking any steps to confirm the arbitration award, the party seeking confirmation of the award must give the other party notice of its intention to confirm the award. If the party who would be the respondent in any such confirmation proceeding performs its obligation under the terms of the arbitration award within 15 business days of such notice, the party who gave notice of its intent to confirm the award shall not seek to confirm or otherwise enforce the award.

(15) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (9) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (9) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of these Terms, including the provisions governing where actions against Fox must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.

Limitation on Time to Bring a Claim

YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FOX SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, THE CONDUCT COMPLAINED OF SHALL BECOME INCONTESTABLE AND SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

Governing Law and Choice of Forum

This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Except with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and Fox agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York to resolve any Dispute arising out of this Agreement or the Fox Nation Services.

YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FOX NATION SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.

Precisely how Fox responds to a party that is violating this Agreement will be determined after carefully analyzing all of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. You may not rely upon Fox's precise response with respect to one party or one situation as any indication of what Fox might do with respect to another party or another situation, even if the parties or situations appear to you to be similar.

Similarly, the failure of Fox to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If we fail to act in response to a violation of this Agreement, you should not assume that we do not object to the violation or even that we are aware of it. In addition, you may not construe a waiver of any provision of this Agreement with respect to any party as a waiver of that provision (or any other provision) with respect to either that party or any other party. Further, Fox's decision to delay exercising or enforcing any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. Even if Fox acts in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with this Agreement, Fox's action shall not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of this Agreement.

Other

The Section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

You agree that any notices Fox may be required by Applicable Law to send to you will be effective upon Fox’s sending an e-mail message to the e-mail address you have on file with Fox or publishing such notices on the informational page(s) of Fox Nation Services. Additionally, from time to time, we may communicate with you about the Services and this Agreement electronically (e.g., emails to your registered email address, notices on the Fox Site and other Access Points). You consent to receive electronic communications from Fox and further agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, and other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any applicable legal notification requirements. We recommend that you keep a copy of any electronic communications we send to you for your records.

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Fox as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Fox Nation Services. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice related to it shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Fox’s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Fox Nation Services or information provided to or gathered by us in connection with such use.

This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy and any other policies expressly incorporated into this Agreement by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Fox with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between the us with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, without Fox’s written authorization.

If you would like to contact us with any questions regarding this Agreement, please contact us here.

1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION

Fox News Network, LLC (“Fox” or “we” or “our”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you in connection with your use of the Fox Nation Services. California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below. By using the Fox Nation Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies (“Fox Affiliates”) is available here at https://www.foxcorporation.com/.

The term “Fox Nation Services” or “Services” refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, and other content we may offer (collectively, the “Content”) and our video player for viewing the Content (the “Video Player”), as well as any other Fox Nation product, feature, tool, material, or other service offered from time to time by Fox through a variety of Access Points. The term “Access Points” refers to, collectively, the Fox Nation website located here at https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/, mobile applications, streaming channels and apps, and other places where any Fox Nation Services are authorized by Fox to be made available. As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Fox Nation Services are for a general audience, are not directed to children, and Fox does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age on or through the Fox Nation Services.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Fox Nation Services, including both those who use the Fox Nation Services without being registered for the Fox Nation Services and those who have registered. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally Fox’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).

2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

Fox and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:

Registration Information is the information you submit to register for the Fox Nation Services, for example, to create a Fox Nation account, post comments, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, phone number, political view, and household income. In addition, Fox may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences, contact Fox through customer service or by other means, or participate in promotions that Fox may offer from time to time. Fox may allow for multiple profiles to be set up under one account. If this occurs, we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.

Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox Nation Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

Information from Social Media. If you access or log-in to the Fox Nation Services through a social media service or connect a Fox Nation Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Fox Nation Services through social media services or when you connect a Fox Nation Service to social media services, you are authorizing Fox to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Activity Information. When you access and interact with the Fox Nation Services, Fox and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox Nation Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox Nation Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Fox’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox Nation Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.

Other parties that support the Fox Nation Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Fox Nation Service usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox Nation Services or other parties’ services (such as website and emails). Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Fox does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.

Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage, and depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox Nation Services.

Information from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Fox Affiliates or business partners.

Authenticated Content. To access certain Content via the Fox Nation Services, you may be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page, and/or you may be required to register directly with your television content provider. Any information that you provide to your television content provider will be subject to the applicable television content provider’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, your television content provider’s use of personal information.

Do Not Track Signals. At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.

Such sharing may be considered a “Sale” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The CCPA provides a right to opt out of the “Sale” of personal information.

Fox News Sites

If you wish to opt out of the “Sale” of your information in connection with tailored advertising that appears primarily on Fox News’ apps, check the box above.

Other Sites

To also opt out of the ""Sale"" of your information related to tailored advertising on other sites, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/# and follow the instructions.

Digital advertising companies have not yet adopted a single method for opting out of “Sales” under the CCPA. In the event that you opt out of the “Sale” of your information, but do not opt out of interest-based advertising more generally on other websites and apps you visit, you may still receive ads tailored to your interests based upon personal information not “Sold” by us, but “Sold” by other sources from which you have not opted out.

Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads. And after opting out of the “Sale” of your personal information as described above, you may still see interest-based ads. Because interest-based advertising relies on cookies and other similar technologies, opting out needs to be controlled at the device and/or browser level. To learn more about interest-based advertising across other websites and apps, and your additional choices for opting out of interest-based advertising, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#.

For mobile and connected TV apps, please visit the Do Not Sell section in Account/Settings for more information and to exercise your choices. To learn more about our information practices, please see our Privacy Policy.",https://nation.foxnews.com/article/do-not-sell-5df81e0a23fb8600186ecc17/
