3,Desert dancers highlight Andean culture,"Story highlights Photographer Andres Figueroa spent a week in one of the driest places on Earth

He took portraits of Chileans who dress up in costume for popular religious festivals

(CNN) South America's Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, resembles some of the faraway planets monitored by giant telescopes there.

The lack of humidity provides optimal conditions to watch the sky and study the origins of the universe.

""It is pure visual silence,"" said photographer Andres Figueroa . ""It is amazing. There is absolutely no humidity, and (these conditions) create some striking contrasts.""

There, in that clear, inhospitably arid environment, Figueroa turned his camera lens toward another discussion on cosmology, one rooted in the ancient folklore of the Andean people.

Taking along his mobile lighting studio, Figueroa photographed a series of religious festivals that take place every July in the Atacama. In his ""Dancers of the Deserts"" series, Figueroa chronicles these festivals, which attract about 200,000 people to some otherwise quiet mining towns in Chile.

4,Dads cherish Sweden's parental leave,"Story highlights Johan Bavman photographed fathers in Sweden, which has generous parental leave

Sweden's policies encourage fathers to take just as much leave as mothers

(CNN) When photographer Johan Bavman became a father for the first time, he took more than a passing wonder about how his native Sweden is said to be the most generous nation on Earth for parental leave.

He immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say.

He used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns.

Get this: Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80% of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22.

But there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers.

5,Making a 'squat' a home,"It's an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls.

She first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree.

The notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled ""A Place Called Home,"" in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.

Having moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.

Through the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.

""As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,"" she said. ""The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project.""

All the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.

I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern

With housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.

""What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living,"" she writes in the text accompanying her images.

""The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt.""

The squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.

But since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.

When squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.

Other images show ""The Castle,"" a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.

Another of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.

For her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. ""The use of natural light adds to a candid feel,"" she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.

""I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home.""

Far from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.

""My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me,"" she said.

""The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs.""

Despite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.

From her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.

""You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views,"" she writes. ""You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary.""",https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/08/living/cnnphotos-a-place-called-home/index.html
6,Amazon natives hold on to tradition,"Story highlights Photographer Trupal Pandya took portraits of the Huaorani people in Ecuador's rainforest

The community is beginning to modernize, but it still maintains its traditional ways of living

(CNN) Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani.

Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits.

The Huaorani, which means ""the people"" or ""human beings,"" are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.

Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.

Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.

7,A glimpse of life on the reservation,"Story highlights German photographer Felix von der Osten spent time at an Indian reservation in Montana

He set out to show the ""beauty and richness of the culture"" and arouse curiosity in viewers

(CNN) Growing up in Germany, everything Felix von der Osten learned about Native Americans came from the books of 19th-century German writer Karl May.

May's most beloved characters, a noble Apache leader named Winnetou and his cowboy blood brother Old Shatterhand, are said to be more popular today in Germany than the works of Thomas Mann, the 20th-century Nobel Prize-winning author of ""Death in Venice.""

It wasn't until von der Osten drove through South Dakota last year, bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic Black Hills, that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were.

Intrigued, the 25-year-old photographer began researching Native American history. What he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to Indian Country to capture the good, the bad and the ugly.

""I wanted to show a slice of life (through) the beauty and richness of the culture,"" he said. ""I didn't want to do reportage. I wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs, like historical documents.""

8,Girls behind bars tell their stories,"(CNN) When photographer Richard Ross wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center, he knocks on their cell door. He asks them if he can come inside.

The 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.

""Most of the kids, they've never had that kind of respect,"" he said. ""But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they're looking down on me.""

Ross doesn't begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.

""I say, 'What's gone on in your life?' ""

The result of that tenderness and patience is Ross' latest collection of photos, ""Girls in Justice.""

The images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person's life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.

Photographer Richard Ross

One photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.

""I've been here 17 times,"" one girl says.

Many of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.

""Mom's a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year,"" said one girl explaining her past. ""They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do.""

The photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn't the girls' -- it's ours as a society for jailing children.

His images aren't always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

Ross recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, ""I can't wait to get out of here so I can kill myself.""

""She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope,"" he said. ""I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that.""

Ross, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.

But times were different then, he said, and there's been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child's bad behavior.

He recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.

You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that. Richard Ross

""This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle,"" Ross recalled. ""He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school.""

The child's single mother couldn't pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.

The detention-center director sent Ross' photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.

Ross is adamant that he's making photographs to bring about ""immediate change.""

He speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.

""I'm trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake,"" he said. ""At the same time, I don't, I can't, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I'm a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories.""",https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/26/us/cnnphotos-girls-behind-bars/index.html
9,Giving a face to Sudan's refugee crisis,"But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.

Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.

His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.

""I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,"" ten Hoopen said.

With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.

Photographer Pieter ten Hoopen

The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.

One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.

""This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,"" ten Hoopen said.

The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.

The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.

Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.

""They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,"" he said. ""I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective.""

The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.

""I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,"" ten Hoopen said.

He said some patients at the hospital ""had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.""

I build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen

Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.

Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.

Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.

""I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,"" he said. ""It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.""

How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?

""It wasn't hard,"" he said. ""I just told them to relax and have fun.

""Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature.""",https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/24/world/cnnphotos-sudan-refugees-portraits/index.html
10,Show animals and their proud handlers,"Story highlights Jooney Woodward took portraits of show animals and their handlers in the UK

The livestock shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings

(CNN) Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows.

Jooney Woodward's ""Best in Show"" is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals.

""When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals,"" Woodward said. ""I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking.""

While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.

""My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,"" she said. ""I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do.""

11,Needy families slept on hospital floors until one doctor started a shelter,"Lima, Peru (CNN) As part of his medical training, Dr. Ricardo Pun-Chong spent time doing rounds in hospitals throughout Lima, the capital of Peru.

Day after day, he noticed families sleeping on the floors.

Many of them, he learned, had come from faraway villages, with little or no money, to get medical treatment for their children.

Navigating the country's difficult terrain -- which spans the Andes Mountains to the Amazon -- often means traversing unpaved roads and can make for a dangerous trip.

""The journey, it's very difficult,"" Pun-Chong said. ""People have to cross the mountains or take a boat to cross the river. It can take many days. Just imagine having this trip with a kid with cancer.""

Far from home and loved ones, and unable to pay for a place to stay in Lima, many families found themselves homeless while fighting for their children's lives.

""I couldn't get the picture of the families sleeping on the floor out of my mind,"" Pun-Chong said. ""So, I decided to do something for them.""

Since 2008, Pun-Chong's nonprofit, Inspira , has provided free housing, meals and overall support for sick children and their families while they undergo treatment. The organization has helped more than 900 families who've come from all over Peru.

Pun-Chong, who lives a few blocks from the shelter and is there almost every day, runs the organization with the help of a small staff and an army of passionate volunteers. He spends every holiday with the families there.

""The kids inspire me every day,"" Pun-Chong said. ""When I'm with these kids, and I feel how strong they are, I understand that there are no problems that we can't resolve.""

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Pun-Chong about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What are some of the obstacles facing these families?

Ricardo Pun-Chong: We have people who come from the Amazon, travel on a boat and from there take a bus. And you're with a sick child, with a fever. Once they reach the city, they don't have any resources. Sometimes they don't even speak Spanish; they speak Quechua, Aymara or other dialects.

For leukemia, the most frequent cancer in kids, the first treatment is about six months. But to stay here is too expensive. Sometimes families, they have to sell everything they have. They feel helpless. They feel really alone. They either have to make it work and stay, or they make the difficult trip back home without their children receiving full treatment.

CNN: What kind of environment have you created at the shelter?

Pun-Chong: The shelter is a very special place. We not only wanted people to have a place to sleep and food to eat, we also wanted to create a space to help the kids be cured. It's a place with a lot of love.

I don't want it to feel like a house, I want it to feel like a home. In the shelter we don't have TV because I prefer to talk to the kids and teach them how to create things. I want them to use their imagination.

The families can stay in our shelter as long as they need, and I want them to know they are not alone, there are a lot of people that are with them.

CNN: What is the unique approach you take with the children?

Pun-Chong: Here we live the day-to-day, but we don't talk about tumors and surgeries and cancer. When I go to the shelter, I leave my stethoscope at home. I come in here as Ricardo, not as a doctor. I want each and every one of them to feel special. I try to lift the spirits of these kids who probably have just undergone surgery. I play and have fun with them and make sure that during this hard time, these kids get to just act like kids.

We are doing everything we can to connect and engage with them. We listen to stories, color, paint, play in the park, ride bicycles. We try to give these kids special things and special experiences. I try to make them laugh, to enjoy themselves. I want these kids to play, to learn, to share. I want to help them to be the happiest they can be.

12,"From tourist to altruist, how a New Yorker embraced Vietnam","Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

""There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,"" Bermas said. ""It stayed with me.""

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

""(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,"" Bermas said. ""We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.""

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

""We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,"" Bermas said. ""Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'""

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' 02:39

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

""It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people,"" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, ""Congratulations"" and ""Welcome."" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

13,"At 17, this sexual abuse survivor set out to fix a broken system","Cochabamba, Bolivia (CNN) Brisa De Angulo grew up in Bolivia and remembers having a wonderful childhood. That is, until she was 15.

That's when she suffered repeated sexual abuse by an adult in her extended family.

His threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.

When she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.

""There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn't stay silent,"" said De Angulo, now 30. ""I found out that I wasn't alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something.""

Of the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women -- with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.

In 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established Fundación Una Brisa de Esperanza -- or A Breeze of Hope Foundation . At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

""We work with the families...to see (the) child as a very powerful survivor, and to have the support that she needs so that she can take her case to court, and she can heal,"" De Angulo said.

The organization also advocates for legal reforms and policy changes for the rights of abuse survivors in Bolivia.

""I had to use the rest of my life to prevent other girls from going through what I went through,"" said De Angulo, whose extensive team has assisted about 1,500 young survivors.

CNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.

CNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you're working to combat?

Brisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it's a boy, then you're in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you're a girl, then you're this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.

We need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.

We also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people -- people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.

CNN: Your experiences inspired you to pursue your law degree. What impact has your organization's legal efforts had?

De Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn't want to take my case.

When we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we've taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.

When I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn't a lawyer, it wasn't the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we've proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.

Another law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn't take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.

CNN: The country now has an annual Walk Against Sexual Violence. How did that come about?

De Angulo: August 9 was one of the hardest days of my life because it was the day I had to go to court and face my aggressor. I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.

(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.

It's beautiful because sometimes you are walking in the street and you see someone with a blue ribbon and you just look at their eyes and you know that we're in this together. And you don't have to say any words, but you know that you're not alone.

15,The child sex trade in Cambodia,"The CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life.

(CNN) When Kieu was 12, her mother asked her to take a job. But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a ""certificate of virginity."" She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.

In 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was ""Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary,"" which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.

In Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.

Kieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of ""maybe more than 50"" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : ""The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.

""Beforehand, Kieu said, 'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt 'very heartbroken.' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, 'They held me like I was in prison.'""

She was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.

Her story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and ""Everyday in Cambodia"" was named ""outstanding documentary"" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.

Sorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.

""Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking,"" she says. ""It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited.""

AIM also now works with an ""incorruptible"" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.

But Sorvino adds that it's not just about helping the victims. ""The demand side really needs to be addressed,"" she says. ""If people weren't trying to buy child sex it wouldn't be being sold.""",https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/03/world/cambodia-child-sex-trafficking/index.html
16,Nepal's Organ Trail: How traffickers steal kidneys,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.

The capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.

The organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity

Organ trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.

That same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.

In Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.

Jeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.

Out of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.

""I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems,"" Jeet Bahadur said.

But many Nepalis do.

During our visit, Nepal Kidney Center in Kathmandu was packed with patients having dialysis -- a grueling four-hour process of purifying blood through a machine.

A patient can avoid the kidney transplant by having dialysis at least three times a week.

Those lucky enough to afford a transplant still face obstacles: the donor must match the blood group of the recipients and Nepali law requires the organ donor to be a family member.

Nepal's 'kidney bank'

We traveled to Kavre, a tiny district close to Kathmandu, and what activists and authorities say is a ground zero for the black market organ trade in Nepal.

Here, kidney trafficking rackets -- well organized and well funded -- dupe the poor and uneducated into giving away a piece of themselves.

The district has developed an unfortunate reputation as the ""kidney bank of Nepal.""

For more than 20 years, activists say, people from villages in Kavre have been the primary source of kidneys for sick and desperate patients throughout Nepal. But now the numbers are being tracked.

In the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.

""Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward,"" said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.

'The meat will grow back'

Nawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.

Like many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms. Poor and uneducated, all he has is two cows, a house and a tiny plot of land.

JUST WATCHED Victims tell their story. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Victims tell their story. 01:01

Pariyar used to visit Kathmandu to find construction work. He was on a site in 2000 when the foreman approached him with a dubious offer: if he let doctors cut out a ""hunk of meat"" from his body, he would be given 30 lakhs -- about $30,000.

What he wasn't told: the piece of ""meat"" was actually his kidney.

""The foreman told me that the meat will grow back,"" Pariyar said.

""Then I thought, 'If the meat will regrow again, and I get about $30,000, why not?'""

""What if I die?"" Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.

The foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.

Then he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.

Traffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.

""At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did,"" Pariyar said.

""I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)

""Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff.""

Pariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.

He never received any more money and never found the trafficker.

""After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt. So, I went to the doctor. That's when I found out I am missing a kidney,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar is now sick and getting worse by the day. He has a urinary problem and constant severe back pain.

But he cannot afford a trip to the doctor and is afraid he will die.

""If I die I can only hope for the government to take care of my two children. I don't know if I will die today or tomorrow. I'm just counting my days,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar's experience is one of many similar stories we heard in Kavre.

Understanding the economic situation in this district is the key to understanding why so many people here easily fall prey to kidney traffickers.

There are hardly any other economic opportunities other than substantial farming and rearing livestock. One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.

""The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible,"" Ghimire said.

Indian links

Traffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.

Few hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants. And even the doctors in Nepal know most well-heeled patients prefer to go across the border to India.

Two brothers who were duped by kidney traffickers show their scars

""They want better services, they want Indian doctors. That's why they go to the hospitals in India,"" said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.

But activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.

""It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India,"" Ghimire said.

We noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.

Photographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.

Since Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.

Activists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.

With the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.

While the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.

Last year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.

Sub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.

""If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another,"" Chand said.

Rajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.

""We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well,"" Ghimire said.

The attention to this problem is growing in Kavre. Kidney trafficking stories are making headlines on the local and national newspapers.

But for victims like Pariyar and others, the media attention is too late.",https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/26/world/asia/freedom-project-nepals-organ-trail/index.html
17,Guatemala: Gender-based violence at epidemic levels,"(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.

But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.

What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.

But the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.

Guatamala's past still haunts

Cifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.

Many women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.

A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.

There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.

Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.

Explosion in violence

Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.

Prevailing culture of machismo

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.

According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, ""80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed."" This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.

Make an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence

U.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls

The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.

""Politicians don't think women are important,"" says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. ""Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor.""

Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.

Quiroa says ""They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade.""

Signs of progress

Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.

Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.

Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or ""The Powerful,"" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.

Five Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or ""The Powerful"" share their stories and help other women get support.

The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.

The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or ""Opening Opportunities"". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.

Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. ""They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights.""

Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.

The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.

Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.

Adelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.

Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, ""We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women.""

But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.

Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.",https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/world/iyw-guatemala-gender-violence/index.html
18,"Aid workers in ISIS bull's-eye: 'If not us, then who?'","New York (CNN) Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year.

The exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them.

Abductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before.

Not all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan.

Here's the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered.

For ISIS, it appears to matter less. Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS' playbook.

These tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS'.

""Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it's never been more dangerous than it is now,"" says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF . ""There used to be a time when an organization's flag provided a great deal of protection. That's no longer the case.""

The response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries.

ISIS doesn't just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria's borders, the risks grow further afield.

Yet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit. Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review.

When CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous.

If I think back, I've been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we're asking people to put themselves in harm's way in some circumstances.

My family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is Westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry, I worry about them and that doesn't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work. I'm very selective about where I say I go. I need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that's here, not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people I'm responsible for in this region.

I don't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one, two, three times -- who don't see a future for their children... Someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security, and I mean that in the personal sense of a mother who, when she goes to sleep at night with her children, she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day.

Mark Ohanian, International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) director of programs

Fear is always there in the back of everyone's mind. We just need to continue what we're doing, stopping is not an option, halting our operations is not an option, and we are taking great risks, our staff are taking great risks.

It is a difficult thing to tell family, to tell colleagues. Oftentimes I just don't mention all the details of where I go because they just don't need to know. But it needs to be done, we also can't run an operation remotely. ... I'm not going to the front lines, I'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we're not adrenaline driven people. We want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks, but it's about calculated risks. We don't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger.

If we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security, morale, pressure from here, pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place. There's not going to be another organization that's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that IOCC may create, that's not going to happen. So that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization; we feel that responsibility that we've got to deliver on this thing.

Dima (last name withheld), aid worker, IOCC

There's an internal motivation that keeps you going. You feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance, and know it's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service. So yes, you need be of course strong, motivated, passionate, and of course feel the need to assist and deliver.

Michael Bowers, senior director for strategic response and emergencies, Mercy Corps

It's an unprecedented time, and what we're calling the new normal ... as we've seen in the last year, the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups, who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we're not the U.S. Army, we don't have a physical ability to repel.

There may be in people's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance: like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car, you'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community. I think that golden age is more myth than reality, but regarding today's reality it's extremely dangerous it's so true. And your flag, your neutrality, your white car, all the good intention you have, that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies.

There's a phrase that the U.N. uses and a lot of NGOs use which is ""stay and deliver,"" so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there, but we always have to be in a risk management role; we have to critically look at: do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get?

The fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends, and that has more of a toll, I think, with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly, sometimes I don't tell them till I'm already on my way so I don't have to have those calls before I even get on an airplane. It's hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don't understand why you're going there, and you re-articulate, ""If not you, then who?"" and you ask, ""Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?""",https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/14/intl_world/iyw-aid-workers-in-danger/index.html
19,Syria's lost generation: Education and dreams deferred,"Story highlights Four years of war means four years without schools and education in Syria

Hiba was nearly done with university when she was forced to flee her home near Damascus

To help Hiba and the many other displaced Syrian students, go to CARE

(CNN) I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago.

I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher.

I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment.

Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety.

When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon.

22,a land where coffee meets tradition,"(CNN) As he tended to his goats one afternoon in the Ethiopian highlands some 12 centuries ago, a herder named Kaldi noticed that his bleating charges seemed energized after chewing mysterious red berries.

Intrigued by the strange reaction, Kaldi took the berries to a local monastery, where the monks promptly threw them in the fire disapproving of their apparently magical attributes.

As the berries were roasted by the heat, a heavenly aroma spread, and they were used to make the first coffee.

Or so the legend of coffee goes. What is more certain is that Ethiopia, widely regarded as the cradle of coffee, is a nation devoted to the stimulating beverage. The country is Africa's biggest producer and ranks fifth globally. Last year it exported 190,000 tonnes of coffee beans, earning around $700 million, and in 2016 Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa will host the 4th World Coffee Conference, a high-level gathering of global experts.

These days the firm's distribution center can hold 1,300 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables

The family started the islands' first dairy, and will open its sixth supermarket franchise

(CNN) Golden beaches and grand hotels can all be found in Mauritius, but there is much more to this island paradise.

The country, located some 500 miles east of Madagascar, has been attracting global investors for decades. But there is also a healthy local appetite for business development -- one of the many reasons the country has been hailed as an African success story.

One company demonstrating this entrepreneurial drive is fresh food suppliers SKC Surat.

""My father Sooklall Surat, started as a farmer with one hectare of land,"" says Suren Surat, who is now CEO of the company his father founded sixty years ago. ""The land was next to our house, where we lived. My father was the first grower at that time, the pioneer for growing strawberries and artichokes in Mauritius.""

Suren Surat has been part of the company from the beginning. The family had enough offspring to start a cricket squad, but the team dedicated its efforts towards business success.

25,The CNN 10: Healthiest cities,"Copenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families. Yet working long hours here is frowned upon.

Just 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.

The cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.

Their ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That’s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.

Other things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.

Men cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don’t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.

Though parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be “pocket parks,” or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.

Here’s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.

This supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities.",http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/09/health/cnn10-healthiest-cities/

Explaining its stance, Wimbledon said it didn't want to ""benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime.""

However, Rafael Nadal Andy Murray , and Novak Djokovic , who have won 10 Wimbledon titles between them, have joined the likes of the ATP and WTA in their opposition to the ban.

""I think it's very unfair (on) my Russian tennis mates, my colleagues,"" Nadal said in a press conference on Sunday ahead of the Madrid Open. ""It's not their fault what's happening in this moment with the war.

""I'm sorry for them, Wimbledon just took their decision ... the government didn't force them to do it. Let's see what happens in the next weeks, if the players will take some kind of decision in that regard.""

Ukrainian players have largely supported Wimbledon's ban, and Sergiy Stakhovsky -- who retired earlier this year and has since joined the Ukrainian army to defend his homeland -- condemned Nadal's stance.

""@RafaelNadal we competed together ... we've played each other on tour,"" Stakhovsky wrote on Twitter

""Please tell me how it is fair that Ukrainian players cannot return home? How it is fair that Ukrainian kids cannot play tennis? How is it fair that Ukrainians are dying?""

The All England Lawn Tennis Club's (AETLC) decision marks the first time that Russian and Belarusian players have been banned from an elite tennis event following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Several high-profile players would be unable to compete, including the men's world No. 2 Daniil Medvedev and the women's world No. 4 Aryna Sabalenka.

Belarusian Sabalenka reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year.

Murray, who is donating all of his prize money this season to humanitarian relief in Ukraine, said that he was ""not supportive"" of the plan to ban Russian and Belarusian players from Wimbledon but added that there was no ""right answer"" to the difficult situation.

""My understanding of the guidance was that Russians and Belarusians can play if they sign a declaration that they're against the war and against the Russian regime,"" he said to journalists at the Madrid Open.

""I'm not sure how comfortable I would feel if something happened to one of the players or their families (as a result).""

In the days following their invasion of Ukraine, Russia's parliament passed a law mandating jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military, greatly increasing the risks for individual Russians speaking out against the war.

The current US Open champion, Daniil Medvedev, is unable to compete at WImbledon this year.

""It's not the same thing, but going through something similar earlier this year for myself, it's frustrating knowing that you're not able to play,"" Djokovic said.

""I still stand by my position that I don't support the (Wimbledon) decision. I think it's just not fair, it's not right, but it is what it is.""

Following criticism from the tennis world, the AELTC defended their decision in a press conference last week.

""Even if we were to accept entries from Russian and Belarusian players with written declarations, we would risk their success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime, which we could not accept,"" tournament chairman Ian Hewitt told reporters last Tuesday.

The players have not yet announced a coordinated response, but the ATP and WTA are reportedly discussing countermeasures that could include the removal of ranking points from Wimbledon.

In a recent interview with CNN, Ukrainian tennis star Marta Kostyuk spoke about the psychcological impact Russia's invasion has had on her.

""I started a couple of weeks ago, which helps me enormously. But you know, sometimes it goes to a certain extent that it's scary, the thoughts that come to you,"" said Kostyuk, who is extremely conscious of the importance of trying to manage her feelings and says she's been working with a psychologist.

""I don't want to say the words because you know, you can figure out what I'm trying to speak about.

""Because at that point, there's so many things going on, you need to carry so much all at once that you are just like, I can't handle this anymore.

""I'm just like, what's the point where it's all going? It's never ending like what should I do with my life now? What am I living for?"" she said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/tennis/nadal-murray-djokovic-wimbledon-ban-spt-intl/index.html

Having not won a PGA Tour event since the U.S. Open last summer, the Spaniard was pushed to the wire to end his dry spell, surviving a late flurry from American pair Brandon Wu and Tony Finau to take a one-shot victory.

The World No. 2 arrived in Vidanta Vallarta as the favorite and played true to predictions with a commanding performance across the first three rounds, opening with a seven-under 64 as he headed into the final day with a two-shot lead.

""Thursday, Friday I played amazing and I was in incredible control of my game, it seemed like nothing really could go wrong,"" Rahm said during his post-tournament press conference.

However, scintillating Sunday performances from Wu and Finau -- who had begun the final round seven shots adrift of Rahm -- left Rahm facing a nervy back-nine.

31,Golden State Warriors overcome Draymond Green ejection to win 117-116 nail-biter against Memphis Grizzlies,"(CNN) The Golden State Warriors overcame the ejection of key forward Draymond Green to win a nail-biter against the Memphis Grizzlies, 117-116, on Sunday in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal in the NBA playoffs.

The Warriors had to play the whole second half without Green after he was ejected for a flagrant two foul -- described in the NBA rulebook for contact deemed to be ""unnecessary and excessive"" -- shortly before halftime.

As Grizzlies forward Brandon Clarke went up for a dunk, in an apparent attempt to block the ball, Green's arm made contact with Clarke's head as he swiped down, while also grabbing Clarke's jersey.

Green could be heard saying that his ""hand got caught in (Clarke's) jersey,"" but he was ejected nonetheless after an official review.

Referee crew chief Kane Fitzgerald explained the why the foul was deemed a flagrant two rather than flagrant one -- which would not have led to an ejection -- after the game.

In the fourth quarter in Boston on Sunday, Antetokounmpo -- with a defender draped all over him -- had picked up his dribble and was struggling to find a teammate.

But rather than trying a speculative shot or pass the ball off, the 'Greek Freak' turned towards the basket, threw the ball off the backboard before slamming home to complete the solo alley-oop.

The explosive display of athleticism gave the Milwaukee Bucks a 94-78 lead late in the fourth quarter and was the crowning moment of the team's 101-89 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of their best-of-seven playoff series.

Antetokounmpo drives to the basket past Robert Williams III.

When he was asked about the electrifying moment, the two-time MVP said it was his method of getting himself out of a jam.

Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball's (MLB) color barrier in 1947, played the Mid-Summer Classic at his home park, Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn, the same year that he claimed the National League Most Valuable Player Award.

The bat was one of two made for Robinson for the game, Goldin said, and shows ""light game use.""

A spokesman for the auctioneer said he could not provide the identity of the buyer.

""The bat has been in the Robinson family archives since the day it was first used by Jackie and I guarantee that is 100% authentic,"" Robinson's widow, Rachel, said in a statement provided by Goldin. The bat had previously hung in the Robinson family home.

37,Tennis star Marta Kostyuk asks 'What am I living for?' as Ukrainians grapple with the toll of Russia's invasion,"(CNN) Right now Ukrainian tennis star Marta Kostyuk is finding it tough focusing on the sport she has dedicated her life to.

At times there's simply too much emotional turmoil and pain to comprehend as the 19-year Kostyuk, who was born in Kyiv, reflects on the impact of Russia's invasion on her country and her fellow Ukrainian players.

""Right now is something indescribable, I would say, because there is a parent of one tennis player that died,"" Kostyuk told CNN Sport. ""There is one tennis player's house that is completely destroyed,"" she said.

Kostyuk's own mental health has been affected as well.

""It was extremely difficult, the first week or two,"" she told CNN in a telephone interview earlier this month.

""It's been two months and you know, it's up and down, it changes. I'm trying to guide myself a little bit, just trying to see where I'm at. Trying to feel myself and trying to figure myself out,"" she added.

Kostyuk is extremely conscious of the importance of trying to manage her feelings and says she's been working with a psychologist.

""I started a couple of weeks ago, which helps me enormously. But you know, sometimes it goes to a certain extent that it's scary, the thoughts that come to you,"" added Kostyuk.

""I don't want to say the words because you know, you can figure out what I'm trying to speak about.

""Because at that point, there's so many things going on, you need to carry so much all at once that you are just like, I can't handle this anymore.

""I'm just like, what's the point where it's all going? It's never ending like what should I do with my life now? What am I living for?"" she said.

Marta Kostyuk is ranked No. 60 in the world in singles and No. 74 in doubles.

'I shouldn't be silent'

What has helped Kostyuk and given her purpose is trying to educate people about the war in Ukraine.

""Everyone is doing this differently, but the only goal that I have is not to feel as if I'm a victim in this situation,"" she said.

""Because I'm not and I'm not positioning myself like this. For the first two weeks [of the invasion], I had this feeling that I'm a victim, like, I don't know what I should do because I rarely feel like this in my life.

""And this was the turning point for me when I changed this mindset of not being a victim,"" she said.

""I shouldn't be silent. I should say what I think. I shouldn't scream at the top of my lungs, like, please help us. We specifically say what we need help with.

""I'm still a tennis player, and I still want to compete. I don't want to get injured. I don't want to go to this to certain points where I'm just, 'you know what? I'm done.' I cannot play tennis at this point ... I cannot do anything.""

Kostyuk is one of several Ukrainian players who have called on Russian and Belarusian athletes to denounce the Russian government's decision to invade Ukraine if they want to compete in international competitions.

'Enormous responsibility'

Earlier this month Wimbledon organizers announced that Russian and Belarusian players will not be allowed to compete at this year's edition following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Twenty-time grand slam champion Serbian Novak Djokovic criticized the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing at Wimbledon this year, calling the move ""crazy.""

Meanwhile, Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev said that the ban is ""illogical"" and amounts to ""complete discrimination.""

In a media conference on Tuesday, Ian Hewitt, who is chairman of the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which runs Wimbledon, said: ""It is not discrimination in the form that is being said, it is a considered view reached as to what is the right and responsible decision in all circumstances.""

""I wouldn't want to live in a country that doesn't allow me to speak out,"" Kostyuk told CNN.

In a Twitter post earlier in April, Kostyuk said: ""As athletes we live a life in the public eye and therefore have an enormous responsibility. .. In times of crisis, silence means agreeing with what is happening.""

As well as Kostyuk, Ukrainian players Elina Svitolina and Sergiy Stakhovsky are among those calling on the WTA, ITF and ATP to ask players with those two nationalities to condemn the invasion.

'Inside the tour, we're alone'

Kostyuk told CNN that critics of her stance have argued that ""tennis players ... have nothing to do with politics.""

""I don't understand, what's the point of dividing these two things? It's one big system that we're circling in. One cannot live without the other, and vice versa,"" she said.

""So for me [the idea that] 'sport is out of politics.' Honestly, for so many years, it's been proven completely the opposite,"" she said.

""We're trying to talk about the fact that none of the players have actually come up and spoken to us to try to help somehow,"" she said.

""We used to be friends with a lot of players. I'm not friends with anyone anymore, like one single player,"" she said.

""We know the whole world is trying to support us [Ukraine]. Everyone knows that what's going on is wrong. And yet inside the tour, we're alone,"" she said.

Kostyuk plays a shot in a match against Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus during day two of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis tournament on February 15, 2022.

In response to Wimbledon's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from this year's tournament, the WTA distanced itself from the AELTC's decision.

""The WTA strongly condemns the actions that have been taken by Russia and its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

""We continue our humanitarian relief efforts to support Ukraine through Tennis Plays for Peace,"" the organization said in a statement, adding they were ""very disappointed"" in the ​decision of AELTC and the Lawn Tennis Association​ which also announced that it would ban Belarusian and Russian athletes from competing in their events.

""A fundamental principle of the WTA is that individual athletes may participate in professional tennis events based on merit and without any form of discrimination,"" they added.

The ATP took a similar position, ​saying the decision ​was ""unfair and has the potential to set a damaging precedent for the game.""

""Discrimination based on nationality also constitutes a violation of our agreement with Wimbledon that states that player entry is based solely on ATP Rankings,"" they added.

""It is important to stress that players from Russia and Belarus will continue to be allowed to compete at ATP events under a neutral flag, a position that has until now been shared across professional tennis.""

""Everyone has a choice""

However, Kostyuk said she believes that Russian and Belarusian players have a responsibility to take a stand on the invasion if they do not support it.

""Russian tennis players, some of them are not actually living in Russia. [They] have all the rights to take their family and move out and say what they really feel is the right thing to do, if they feel that they have to speak out against it.

""Yet they're not doing it. They had enough time to do it, let's be honest,"" she added.

""Everyone has a choice to make. There are a bunch of tennis players who have resources to move their family out of the country. And yet they're not doing it. Why, I don't know. ​

""I wouldn't want to live in a country that doesn't allow me to speak out; that doesn't allow me to live my life​; that ​(wants) my family in danger because of my actions. ​

""That's why we're trying to force them to speak out anyhow, like even if you support this invasion, talk about it​; just say your opinion publicly. But they know that if they do it, they will be out of work,"" she said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/tennis/marta-kostyuk-tennis-ukraine-russia-spt-intl/index.html
38,Shakhtar Donetsk: Football club has lost its home again. Now it tours Europe raising money for war victims in Ukraine,"(CNN) When Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on the morning of February 24, Darijo Srna was awoken at 6 a.m. by the sound of air raid sirens.

It was a noise the former international football star says immediately transported his ""head and body"" back to his native Croatia, where he lived as an eight-year-old when war broke out in what was then Yugoslavia.

So when his football club Shakhtar Donetsk was forced to leave Kyiv, the city that had been one of the team's many temporary bases since 2014, at the start of Russia's invasion, it was unfortunately a scenario Srna was all too familiar with.

The former Croatian international is just 39 years old, but he has already experienced three wars in his life; first in Croatia in the early 1990s, then in 2014 in Ukraine's Donbas region -- Shakhtar's real home -- and now across much of the rest of the country.

""It was not a nice memory,"" Srna, who is Shakhtar Donetsk's director of football, says of his childhood. ""When I started to forget about that a little bit and enjoy my life, I heard the sirens again.

""I'm strong. I want to be strong, but sometimes is difficult because of everything, because you lost your home twice. In this moment, it's important to be positive, to be strong and to give a positive impression to everyone.""

Darijo Srna won the UEFA Cup with Shakhtar Donetsk in 2009.

Srna -- who, along with the rest of the team, managed to escape Ukraine the day after Russia began its invasion -- has found his strength in helping those most affected by the war in Ukraine.

Shakhtar, where Srna is a club legend after playing for 15 seasons, has been homeless for almost eight years now, ever since fighting broke out between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces in 2014.

After retiring from professional football in 2019, Srna took up the role of assistant coach at Shakhtar before becoming the club's director of football.

He is acutely aware that his plight and that of the rest of the team is nothing compared to those fighting on the front line and has been helping to lead the club's effort in providing support for Ukrainian soldiers and refugees.

Shakhtar is currently in the middle of a European tour -- the 'Global Tour for Peace' -- during which they will play against a number of clubs to raise money for those caught up in the war.

""We cannot compare ourselves with the people of Ukraine,"" Srna tells CNN Sport's Don Riddell. ""But we are a football team, we are football players and we are trying to do something we know how to do -- and that is play football.

Darijo Srna amassed 134 caps for Croatia and played at two World Cups.

""All the income we receive from tickets and from sponsors for these games we are sending to Ukraine for the children, for people who are in a very difficult situation.

""Together with our [club] president, Rinat Akhmetov -- who is still there helping Ukrainian citizens every day in different kind of ways, medicaments and everything -- we are now like one family and we are trying to do our best to help the citizens of Ukraine today in this difficult situation.""

Before the opening match of the tour, a 1-0 defeat by Greek giant Olympiacos, Shakhtar's players wore t-shirts featuring the names of the places in Ukraine that had been most affected by Russia's assaults, including Mariupol and Irpin.

Shakhtar has since played games against Turkish clubs Fenerbahce and Antalyaspor and Polish side Lechia Gdansk, and has a match against Croatia's Hajduk Split scheduled for May 1.

There was a particularly moving moment in the match against Gdansk earlier this month when Dmytro Keda, a 12-year-old Ukrainian refugee, came on as a last-minute substitute and scored the winning goal.

Keda, who fled his hometown of Mariupol in Ukraine after spending three weeks holed up as Russian forces bombarded the city, was mobbed by players from both teams and was held aloft in celebration.

Darijo Srna celebrates after scoring against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League at the Donbass Arena in 2013. The following year, Shakhtar was forced from its home.

Shakhtar's head coach Roberto De Zerbi explained after the match that the decision to let Keda come on and score was ""spontaneous.""

So far, Shakhtar says the tour has raised 8.2 million Ukrainian hryvnia ($271,000), with around a quarter of the total already being transferred to Akhmetov's foundation in Ukraine.

""When I asked the Ukrainian players: 'Are you ready to play, for example, every second game, every third game?'"" Srna recalls. ""'The more games [we play], the more money for Ukrainians.'

""They responded to me: 'Darijo, we are Ukrainians. We can do everything.' And for me, that was a moment I will never forget.

""But this is the Ukrainian people. I arrived 19 years ago and they received me like part of their family from the first day and me and my family will never forget that. I've lived more in Ukraine than in Croatia. This is my home. Today I'm Ukrainian and everything we can do for them in these difficult moments, we will do. Believe me.

""I am proud that I lived there, that I played there, that I met them because they are people with a huge heart, always positive. They didn't attack anyone. They didn't want to take one centimeter of another country's land and they're heroes today. I'm so proud of them and me personally, I will be with them until the end.""

Srna explains that the war has been particularly difficult for the younger members of Shaktar's squad to process.

Among them is the former captain of a club in Mariupol, who was invited to play with the team on their tour after he ""lost everything"" during Russia's ongoing bombardment of the city.

""First of all, it's good that they are young,"" Srna says. ""In front of them, there is a long career and this can just make them stronger. I will say one thing: the most beautiful period of Croatia were the 10 or 15 years after the war.

""I believe that Ukraine will be united until the end and after the war we will be altogether. We will drink together, we will smile together, we will cry together. The most important thing will be peace in this moment.""

39,"'My heart is torn': As war rages on at home, these young disabled Ukrainian swimmers are stranded in Turkey","(CNN) On February 17, a team of young disabled Ukrainian swimmers traveled to Turkey to nurture their ambitions of becoming elite professionals .

The camp of seven budding athletes arrived with their three coaches in the town of Silivri, just outside of Istanbul, to take part in a two-week training program.

A week later their lives were upended when Russia invaded Ukraine

Since the invasion began on February 24, there have been deadly airstrikes , and horrific scenes of mass graves and murdered civilians across Ukraine -- while global leaders have accused Russian forces of carrying out war crimes

While one young swimmer has traveled to Poland with his mother, they have been in Turkey for two months now, and many of their family members are still marooned in Ukraine.

Team member Victoria Kharchenko, who has cerebral palsy, says her parents find comfort in the fact that she is safe.

""They're happy ... we don't need to stay in the air raid shelters, and do not hide,"" the 16-year-old athlete tells CNN's Jomana Karadsheh.

Caught in the crossfire of war

Kyrylo Garashchenko is one of the Ukrainian swimmers stuck in Turkey, and he is struggling to process what is happening as war rages in his homeland.

""I just try to (not) think about it, because it's a lot of information about war,"" the 24-year-old Paralympian says.

Garashchenko, who is visually impaired, competed at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics last summer, where he won silver and bronze medals for Ukraine in the men's 400-meter freestyle event, and the mixed 4x100-meter freestyle relay event respectively.

He hopes to add to his medal count at the upcoming World Para Swimming Championships in Madeira, Portugal in June, but says it's ""very difficult to stay in another country and prepare when (there is a) war in your country.""

Garashchenko, who is the oldest member of the team, hails from Zaporizhzhia -- a southeastern Ukrainian city that has been caught in the crossfire of the war amid stalled evacuation attempts and previous occupation by Russian forces.

Ilia Sharkov, who has cerebral palsy, tells CNN it's difficult to focus on his ambition of becoming a Paralympic swimmer when his parents live in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, where civilians have seen colossal explosions by Russian forces and the detention of their ex-mayor -- who Ukrainian officials say was eventually freed

Silver medalist Kyrylo Garashchenko of Team Ukraine poses during the men's 400-meter freestyle - S11 medal ceremony on day 3 of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.

To call and see their son, Sharkov's parents must bike 50 kilometers (31 miles) from their home for internet access.

So 15-year-old Sharkov asks CNN to send his family a message: ""My dearest father and mother, I love you so much.""

""I wish you happiness and health. Say 'hello' to my grandparents and my aunt.""

Sharkov's teammates and their families are part of the roughly 12 million people who have been displaced due to the ongoing war.

Of that, there are about 4.9 million refugees and 7.1 million people internally displaced in Ukraine , Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, said on Monday during a news briefing.

Likewise, nearly two-thirds of Ukrainian children are also displaced due to the war, according to figures from UNICEF.

'We really became like one family'

The Ukrainian swim team sits down to eat a meal together at Kasımpaşa SK football club.

Coach Iryna Paveleva says that initially, the team had the opportunity to bond during the first two weeks of their trip to Turkey because they stayed in a house together in Silivri.

""We really became like one family ... cooked food together, rested together, spent some time together,"" she says. ""This made us not just coaches and athletes, but more like kindred spirits.""

""Every day we thought about our families, about our children who are in Ukraine, about our parents and it was ... this is probably such a shock state for us, and the children supported us so much. We could not even believe that children at such a small age can provide us with such moral support.""

But as the war in Ukraine has worsened, so has the young athletes' welfare.

Their coaches previously sought out the support of child psychologists, although they can no longer afford their services.

Speaking about the young swimmers, Paveleva says: ""They lack affection. we give them affection, warmth, and they give it to us probably even more.

""In the evening they don't let us go, and ask to hug and kiss us.""

Nearly half a million children face serious risks to their mental and physical health due as a result of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, according to a UNICEF statement from early February.

""This trauma risks destroying a generation,"" Sima Bahous, executive director of the UN gender equality and empowerment agency UN Women said in a statement in April.

Coach Iryna Paveleva trains with a Ukrainian swim team of young disabled athletes in Istanbul.

As Paveleva juggles the needs of the young swimmers, she is also thinking about her own daughter, who lives with her elderly grandparents in Ukraine.

She tells CNN that her mind is split between making the journey back to Ukraine to take care of her family, and honoring her commitment to the young swim team in Istanbul.

Even if the team wanted to try to reunite with their families in Ukraine, such a journey would be risky -- especially with the challenge of disability

There are about 2.7 million people with disabilities in Ukraine, according to the European Disability Forum, a pan-European NGO.

Figures from Inclusion Europe, another NGO, estimated that there are around 261,000 people in Ukraine with intellectual disabilities that make them extremely vulnerable to the conflict.

""Every day my heart is torn two ways, between my family home and these children,"" Paveleva says.

A home away from home

In the meantime the team has found a temporary home in Kasimpasa Sports Club, a Turkish professional football club based in Istanbul.

They have access to free accommodation and are served hot meals everyday, although increasingly rely upon charity to sustain themselves while training at a local public pool.

The group had arrived in Turkey with enough clothes for a short trip during colder months, but as the weather is getting warmer in Istanbul they need lighter clothes.

Earlier this month CNN came across a social media post published by an Istanbul resident, helping collect aid including clothes, shoes and snacks for the team.

After CNN's report aired on Monday and was shared on social media platforms, several Istanbul residents including Ukrainians, Russians and others have offered to help and support the young athletes.

Some want to help send them clothes, snacks, money and books. Others offered to treat the team to a day out in Istanbul, or yoga and art sessions to help keep their minds off their ordeal.

Mykyta Dudchenko speaks with his mother, who is in Ukraine, over the phone.

Mykyta Dudchenko is a 15-year-old swimmer who has cerebral palsy. His aunt, Yana Protsenko, started an online fundraiser in February to generate donations for Dudchenko and his teammates, who have been sent clothes and fresh fruit from benefactors.

""Their spirits are not broken, and they want to continue training for their mental health and their dreams,"" Protsenko said on her GoFundMe page, a fundraising site where she launched her efforts.

""They are far away from their families, friends, and their own country, and no one knows when they meet again,"" she added.

For Dudchenko, the most challenging part of the day is speaking to his mother, Viktoria Dudchenko, on the phone.

""Are you sleeping well? Are you eating? You've lost weight my son,"" she says to him over the phone. ""I worry about you.""

""We hope the Ukrainian armed forces will throw the enemy out soon, and you'll come back, and we will hug you,"" she adds.

""I want to go home so much,"" he tells her.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/23/sport/russia-ukraine-disabled-swim-team-turkey-spt-cmd-intl/index.html
40,Ukrainian tennis players live 'parallel lives' at the Billie Jean King Cup,"(CNN) Wearing a shirt decorated with the Ukrainian flag in the shape of a heart, Lyudmyla Kichenok practiced her serve with teammate Dayana Yastremska in an empty arena under the watchful eyes of their captain Olga Savchuk on Thursday.

In Asheville, North Carolina, the Ukrainian women's tennis team is in the midst of their match against Team USA for the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers. Meanwhile, bombs rain down on their hometowns as war rages on in Ukraine.

""I feel like we have two different realities right now. The tennis court, an amazing atmosphere, amazing arena here. And then on the other side, we have people dying every day,"" Katarina Zavatska told CNN Sport.

Despite a valiant recovery from 2-0 down, a stunning fightback ultimately fell just short as Team USA edged Ukraine in the deciding doubles game to take the tie 3-2 on Saturday.

Yastremska, ranked 93rd in the world, had beaten world No.14 Jessica Pegula before Zavatska pulled off an even bigger upset to defeat Shelby Rogers, ranked 155 places above her to draw Ukraine level at 2-2.

However, a 7-6(5) 6-3 doubles victory for Pegula and Asia Muhammad over Kichenok and Yastremska saw the US progress to the finals in November.

Leaving Ukraine

Dayana Yastremska serving against Alison Riske during the first round of the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup Qualifier on April 15, 2022.

Less than three months ago, both Kichenok and Yastremska were far from the tennis court, fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On February 25, Kichenok left Ukraine with her parents. She drove for 31 hours straight from Kyiv to Chisinau, Moldova -- a 500-mile trip.

""Honestly, I've never experienced such a fear in my life. My body was shaking for two hours. I couldn't talk. Like, it was really shocking. And yeah, a couple days I couldn't eat anything,"" Kichenok said to CNN. ""Those days were like the most difficult in my life, I can say for sure.""

Lyudmyla's sister, Nadiia, had left Ukraine early to prepare for Indian Wells Open and found out about the war on the news.

""I knew my sister's there in Kyiv, my mother is there in Kyiv, my dad is in Kyiv. And it was just -- until they arrived to Moldova -- just two days of hell,"" Nadiia told CNN Sport. ""I mean, I've never experienced anything like that. This fear is just hard to express. It was pulling me apart. I had constant panic attacks.""

Yastremska crossed the Danube River into Romania from Izmail with her younger sister the same day the Kichenoks left Kyiv. But unlike Lyudmyla, the Yastremska sisters had to leave their parents behind.

""That day I'm going to remember for all my life when I was leaving, especially when we crossed the border,"" Yastremska told CNN. ""You see your parents on the other side of the river and you just didn't realize till the end how this happened, how these things can happen in 2022.""

Playing tennis and being at war

At first, it was hard for Lyudmyla to play tennis. When she arrived at Indian Wells in California, she struggled to reconcile the peace she saw on the court with the war being waged on her home.

""My first day on site, that tennis center was shocking. I was shocked how people can still laugh. They were laughing, just living a normal life,"" Lyudmyla said. ""I didn't understand how is it possible because my mind was still there.""

Yastremska has also struggled with maintaining her focus on the tennis court. Over time, playing has gotten easier, but most of her thoughts are still with Ukraine.

""Well, I'm not going to lie even to myself. It's very hard. I'm trying to pretend like I'm pretty strong and I can play and stuff, but it's not true. It's very hard,"" she explained.

Savchuk describes it as a ""parallel life."" When she looks around her, she sees people living normally but her heart remains in Ukraine where war rages on.

Nadiia though has found some solace on the court. Playing tennis forces her to put her phone down for a couple of hours and distract herself from the constant news of war in Ukraine.

Like Nadiia, Zavatska has also derived some comfort from tennis. She's grateful for the opportunity to play tennis, considering the dire situation in her home country.

Katarina Zavatska talks with her team following her loss to American Jessica Pegula in the first round of the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup qualifier.

""Tennis is, for me, the only place where I feel alive, where I feel that I can live and that I don't think about the news. I don't think about bad things. I only think about the ball, that I'm on the court, that I just do my job,"" Zavatska said.

""It's such a big chance to do this, to be able to have everything, what I have right now, every second to be able to play tennis. It's just amazing. You know, what a chance after all, what a chance to be a tennis player.""

Finding support on the court

The players are doing everything they can on and off the court to support their families and friends back in Ukraine. Zavatska uses the money she earns playing tennis to support her family because, right now, no one else has a job.

""It's a lot of things. You have to, you have to pay the bills, you have to think about others, you have to help others,"" she explained. ""It's not a pressure, but it's something where I feel like I can do and what I'm doing every day.""

Yastremska donated all her prize money from her run in the Lyon Open to relief efforts in Ukraine and has been using her own charitable foundation for humanitarian aid. While Yastremska wants to go home and see her parents, she knows she can be more helpful by using her platform as a tennis player.

""I know that because I am a professional tennis player, I have more opportunities to talk about it. I have more opportunities to help,"" she said.

Katarina Zavatska returns a serve from Jessica Pegula during the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup qualifier.

But the Ukrainian players are certainly not alone in their endeavors. Team USA showed their support for their opponents with a dinner on Thursday ahead of their first matches. At the dinner, Team USA gifted each member of the Ukrainian squad a blanket decorated with both the US and Ukrainian flags and the message: ""We stand with you.""

A month ahead of the match on March 18, the USTA announced that 10% of the ticket revenue from the event would be donated to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund by Global Giving and that local sponsors of the event would also make donations.

On April 7, the USTA also announced that Billie Jean King would attend the match along with her partner Ilana Kloss. King and Kloss have also made a $50,000 donation to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund.

Finding strength in Ukraine

When the war broke out, both Nadiia and Zavatska were surprised and amazed by the power and unity they saw in their country and their people.

""People in Ukraine, they're so strong right now. I mean, they're amazingly strong. I didn't know that this power exists,"" Zavatska said.

The entire Ukrainian team is empowered by the strength they see in their home country and that's the one thing they want the world to know about the nation: its strength.

Ukraine fans cheer during the match between Dayana Yastremska and Alison Riske in the first round of the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup qualifier on April 15, 2022 in Asheville, North Carolina.

""I thought I always had a fear, but comparing to those people [back in Ukraine], they don't have a fear. They go just for everything. They're ready for everything,"" said Yastremska.

""I'm very proud of everybody there, and I'm proud of being Ukrainian, proud of Ukraine, proud of everybody who is out there fighting for the country.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/17/tennis/ukraine-tennis-parallel-lives-billie-jean-king-cup-spt-intl/index.html
41,Walter Hagen: The 'flamboyant' golfer who 'poked golf's aristocracy in the eye',"(CNN) When Walter Hagen won the PGA Championship for the second year in a row in 1925, he did what any champion would do: head out to celebrate.

So, he grabbed the famous Wanamaker Trophy -- given to the winner of the major -- jumped in a nearby taxi and headed to a nightclub where he knew his friends were.

When Hagen arrived at the club and to avoid lumbering around with the 27-pound trophy, he paid the taxi driver to drop it off at his hotel.

It was the last he saw of the trophy.

The Wanamaker never arrived at his hotel, and although Hagen knew he no longer had it in his possession, he kept that to himself.

At the next year's PGA Championship, when asked to produce the trophy as the returning champion, Hagen said with his typical bravado: ""I will win it anyway, so I didn't bring it.""

Sure enough, he did win it. And in 1927, he won it for the fourth time in a row. It was only in 1928, when he was knocked out by Leo Diegel, that he was forced to admit he no longer had the trophy in his possession.

A replacement was made, before the original mysteriously turned up 1931.

Hagen takes a swing during the 1940 Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.

Beginnings

Hagen was born into a ""blue-collar family"" in 1892 in Rochester, New York, explains Tom Clavin, author of 'Sir Walter: Walter Hagen and the Invention of Professional Golf.'

Hagen's early days in golf were spent as a caddie at the Country Club of Rochester.

By his mid-teens, Hagen was a proficient player and was helping at the pro shop at the club. He made his professional debut at age 19 at the 1912 Canadian Open.

Hagen plays a shot at Short Hills in Rochester.

Playing in his debut major -- the 1913 U.S. Open -- Hagen shocked many when he finished tied for fourth. But upon his return to Rochester, he came with tales of mistreatment from the other professionals.

""They pushed me off the tee and told me I could practice when they got through,"" he said

So he made a promise to them. ""I'm going back next year and win that tournament.""

And he did just that.

'He represented the barbarians at the gate of golf'

Golf wasn't the only sport Hagen was proficient at. From an early age, he also excelled at baseball.

But his talent at baseball and blossoming golf career gave Hagen a dilemma.

""Baseball is a team sport. Walter liked the attention to be all on him,"" Clavin explained. ""So he didn't want to share the attention with the pitcher or the first baseman or the catcher.

""I think a big part of it was that he was not only good at it, probably figured he would be better as a golfer than as a baseball player, and he could call his own shots, so to speak.

""He didn't have to depend on anybody else. Either he won because he was better than everybody else on the field, or he lost because he wasn't. And in baseball, you're sort of dependent on the other guys on the field.""

As Clavin describes, when Hagen was making his first steps in golf, it was a sport in its nascent stages in the US. And Hagen, being an aspiring professional, saw a huge potential for growth, both for the game and for himself.

His professionalism irked many in golf.

""He sort of poked the aristocracy in the eye. And there were a lot of people in the aristocracy who really despised Walter Hagen because of what he represented,"" Clavin explained.

""He represented the barbarians at the gate of golf, and he took that as motivation, and they despised him even more when he kept winning.""

On the town

With plenty of disposal income, Hagen was keen to enjoy the fruits of his labour.

He also trie marriage briefly, but Clavin says that it ""didn't work out very well.""

As a result of his ""extravagant lifestyle"" choices, as Clavin describes it, winning became a necessity.

""He wanted to win that first-place purse, he wanted to go on these paid tours, he wanted to do these endorsement deals and endorse cigarettes and other products,"" said Clavin.

""And so obviously, if he had not been able to win as often as he did, he would have had to at some point face the reality of: 'I can't live the lifestyle because I simply can't afford it.'""

During his illustrious career, Hagen won 11 major titles -- the most ever at the time -- as well as 45 PGA Tour victories.

Hagen, holding the Claret Jug, on the 1st tee during an exhibition match with Joe Kirkwood at Llanwern, South Wales in 1937.

What's even more remarkable is that the Masters had not even been founded until well after Hagen's peak.

Many of the stories that are recounted about Hagen are tales of his hitting the town and turning up looking disheveled for the play the following day.

However, Clavin believes that Hagen would not actually go out the night before and was attempting to lower the guard of his opponents. Clavin calls Hagen ""the first great sports psychologist.""

""For example, suppose it was a major tournament, he would have his limousine show up and he would get out of the limousine in a rumpled tuxedo,"" Clavin said.

""So everybody would think: 'Oh, poor Walter, he's probably very hungover. He's not going to be a factor today.' Then he'd go into the locker room and change and come out to the first tee and strike one right down the middle of the fairway.

""He knew before he even hit his first ball, he figured: 'I'm a winner and these guys are going to be losers because they are somewhat intimidated by me. They can't figure me out.' He had a mental advantage that was unmatched by his competitors at the time.""

Origin

Hagen earned favor with his fellow golfers by always picking up the bill in the bar. His trailblazing nature when it came to proving golf a reliable revenue stream also endured himself to others.

His rivalry with Bobby Jones at the time also did a lot to popularize the sport, the pair traveling the world to compete in money-making, one-on-one competitions.

They both made endorsing golf equipment for players a more commonplace endeavor and something which helped to make the sport more accessible for all.

Hagen (right) stands with Gene Sarazen (left) on board the RMS Aquitania on arrrival in Southampton, June 21, 1933.

Gene Sarazen, who was 10 years younger than Hagen and won seven majors in his career, said golfers should thank Hagen for his impact on the sport.

""All the professionals ... should say a silent thanks to Walter Hagen each time they stretch a check between their fingers. It was Walter who made professional golf what it is.""

Not only that, he played a vital part in the establishment of the Ryder Cup, featuring in the early editions of it and being a six-time captain of the US team, winning it four time and losing just twice.

Hagen was a pioneer in golf's professionalization.

And so, given all Hagen did for the sport, Clavin believes it is no exaggeration to call him the ""father of professional golf.""

""Walter Hagen was very much aware of what a pioneer he was. He could look around the landscape and realize that there were very few professional golfers, but of those few golfers, he was the most successful one.

""And so he understood the responsibility he had to continue to play well and not even play well for his own purposes to win the tournament purses, but to sort of be like this Johnny Appleseed of golf; he did go on these world tours, which nobody else had done before.

""Not Bobby Jones, not anybody else. To go on these world tours more than once that took him to Africa, took him to Asia, took him to Europe obviously, took him to pretty much every continent except Antarctica to play these exhibition matches and spread the word of golf and to introduce golf to countries that had never even had it.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/golf/walter-hagen-golf-spt-intl/index.html
42,"Jarrod Bowen: 'The dream is a reality now,' says West Ham star","(CNN) Jarrod Bowen joined West Ham United in January 2020 and as he looks back over the last few years with the club it's almost as if he can't quite believe what has happened.

West Ham finished the 2019/20 season five points shy of relegation, having lost half of its matches during that campaign.

Last season the club climbed 10 places up the Premier League table -- when the 25-year-old Bowen scored eight goals and made five assists -- and missed out on the Champions League by just two points.

Now, the West Ham United striker is looking forward to his side's first European semifinal in 46 years in a fated reunion against Eintracht Frankfurt.

""I think it's people seeing West Ham for what West Ham are about now. Since I've been here, we were staying up from relegation which was crazy to think,"" Bowen tells CNN Sport's Darren Lewis.

""Fast forward two and a half years and we finished in the top six and (are) on course to finish in the top six again, maybe even get to a Europa League final,"" he adds. ""People should think about West Ham differently now.

""Just goes to show what happens when a manager [David Moyes] comes in and gets a group of players that are 100% committed and ... want to work for each other.""

Europa League dream

West Ham's Europa League journey to the last four has been nothing short of remarkable.

After topping its group stage, West Ham won 2-1 on aggregate against Sevilla with a late winner from Andriy Yarmolenko in the second-leg tie -- ending the Spanish side's hopes of adding to its record six Europa League titles.

Then, West Ham knocked out French club Lyon 4-1 on aggregate in the quarterfinals, thanks to decisive goals from Craig Dawson, Declan Rice and Bowen -- despite having played with 10 men during the second half in the first leg.

""To have that opportunity against Lyon and to beat them and go through was probably the best feeling ever,"" Bowen says.

It seems as though the stars have aligned for the draw against Eintracht Frankfurt, given that the previous time both clubs met was West Ham's last European semifinal in 1976.

Bowen celebrates after scoring against Lyon in the Europa League quarterfinal second leg at the Parc Olympique on April 14, 2022.

Like West Ham, Eintracht Frankfurt is a team to be reckoned with, having previously beaten favorites Barcelona at the Camp Nou stadium in the quarterfinals.

""They're to be feared but I think we are as well,"" Bowen says of the draw. ""You don't want to get too ahead of yourself ... you're two games away from a final. It's an exciting time, I for one am buzzing,"" he adds. ""It's a special game coming up.""

West Ham has never played in the Champions League, and their last European win was when they lifted the Intertoto Cup in 1999.

Bowen says his team won't stop chasing a Champions League qualification. With four games still to play, West Ham is eight points behind fourth-place Arsenal.

""People writing us off is lovely for me because you like proving people wrong all the time,"" Bowen says. ""As a club we'll always fight and we want to be in that fourth spot, and there's no reason why we can't be.""

'Hard work does beat talent'

As a youngster, Bowen was told he wasn't good enough to play professional football.

After a spate of unsuccessful trials at Aston Villa and Cardiff City, his childhood dream looked to be slipping out of reach.

""To be honest, I think what I'd been through going through trials and not knowing where I was going to be, it was just a case of enjoying my football and see what happens,"" says Bowen. ""I had a slice of luck, people know people in the game.""

He eventually broke into the first team at non-league side Hereford United when he was 17, but his ambitions took another knock when his home club financially folded in 2014.

When asked how he pushed through he says, ""I think just for the love of the game and love of ... playing for my boyhood club.""

""I had no bills or nothing to pay out for, but you know, you look at some of the players who were playing ... that had mortgages and kids to pay for. It must have been hard for them,"" he adds. ""I had no fear, no responsibility.""

At the age of 17 Bowen signed with Hull City, where he played for the Under-18 team for a few years.

""My family didn't want me to move so far away at 17, but moving that far at such a young age, I learned so many life experiences and matured off the pitch, and I think that maturity went onto the pitch as well and no obstacle appeared too high,"" Bowen told West Ham's website.

Bowen stretches to control the ball during the English FA Cup fourth round football match between Hull City and Chelsea at the KCOM Stadium in Kingston-upon-Hull on January 25, 2020.

""Looking back on it now, I'm glad I went further away from home.""

He was itching to play for Hull City's first team, but saw his hopes challenged by more experienced forwards, including Adama Diomande and Nikica Jelavic.

Bowen finally made his Premier League debut for Hull in August 2016, although the club was then relegated in May 2017.

Bowen spent a few more years at Hull polishing his game, before signing with West Ham three years later.

Reflecting on his journey he tells CNN, ""I think hard work does beat talent.""

""It's about taking your chance and I think you can get all the luck in the world, but I think if you're not ready to be ready at the time that you need to be, then you won't do well.

""I think (it) just shows (the) mental strength I've got and the resilience I've got,"" he says. ""No matter how many times something goes wrong, there's always going to be light at the end of the tunnel.

""I look back on that now and think thank God I kept playing and put my mind to it and I had my family around me to support me, to get me to where I am now.""

Like father like son

The West Ham forward attributes much of his success to his father, Sam Bowen.

A retired non-league Welsh footballer, Sam was once on the verge of signing with West Ham at the behest of then-manager Harry Redknapp, according to the club's website.

He enjoyed a career as a striker for clubs including Worcester City, Forest Green Rovers and Leominster Town.

""I mean, he's done everything,"" Bowen says of his father. ""He's seen the highs, the lows of my career, so you know, he's everything to me and he's been there every step of the way for me.

""As much as he praises me, he's also my number one critic as well. You know when I don't play well or something, he'd be the first one to tell me. I'd prefer that than him just telling me how good I am.""

West Ham have once again being challlenging to play European football next season.

Bowen grew up on a farm in Herefordshire, England, and has memories of pushing wheelbarrows of concrete up and down potato fields -- an exercise indicative of his father's unique training style.

""It's a bit different to what you're probably used to seeing pre-season ... but that's my dad, he's old school. He's different, he doesn't want me to be the same as everyone else.""

Bowen explains his father's mantra is to have ""a reverse gear.""

""No matter how many times you get knocked down, it's about pushing forwards,"" adds Bowen.

""I think that's worked a lot for my mind as well; I'm resilient, I'm never beaten, I think it's just hard work and I think that's why the work I put on the pitch gets noticed by the fans ... and I think that's come from a young age.""

Underdog turned rising star

As he's risen through the ranks of English football Bowen has been likened to Premier League strikers such as Jamie Vardy and Harry Kane, both of whom have enjoyed later success after their days as underdogs in the early stages of their careers.

""I think the talent they've got is unquestionable, they're unbelievable two strikers but I think the hard work they've got and the character they've got within themselves pushes them even more,"" Bowen says.

When it comes to players in attacking positions Bowen counts Lionel Messi and David Beckham as sources of inspiration, but he says Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah currently represents the gold standard.

""I think that the goals he scores, you know, when he gets a chance, nine times out of 10 it's in the back of the net, the work he does off the ball as well,"" says Bowen.

""When we played against them, I wasn't watching him when I was playing because that would be wrong to say, but I noticed the work he does off the ball.""

West Ham's Kurt Zouma, left, and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah fight for the ball during the English Premier League soccer match between Liverpool and West Ham United at Anfield in March 2022. Bowen is an admirer of Salah's work ethic.

Salah has scored 30 goals for Liverpool across the Premier League and the Champions League this season, as well as making 13 assists.

""I think consistency is a big word. I think especially in (an) attacking position, people expect you to produce goals or set up goals for your teammates and that comes with being an attacker, so definitely scoring goals helps with the confidence,"" Bowen says of Salah. ""I think it just comes from standards within yourself that you set.""

West Ham won their home Premier League match against Liverpool 3-2 this season, having lost the game at Anfield 1-0.

As the season comes to a close, Bowen says he has also noticed the level of consistency that's been shown by Liverpool's forward players like Salah, Sadio Mane , Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz.

""I think you look at every front three that Liverpool have and the work they do off the ball and we played them especially the way they pressed from the front as well, their front three isn't just a case of they don't defend; they just attack. They do attack and defend and you know, they get their rewards from it.""

Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane applauds the fans following during the Premier League match against Brentford at the Community Stadium in London on April 23, 2022. Like Bowen, Kane took time to find his feet in the Premier League.

England calling?

From scoring nine goals in the Premier League this season, to tallying three winners for West Ham's Europa League campaign, Bowen is having a season to remember.

""The dream is a reality now. Growing up, it was 'I wanted to be a footballer', it's football or nothing really,"" Bowen says. ""It's one hell of a journey and it's gone so quick.

""I've blinked and it's fast-forwarded eigh years, but (I'm) loving every minute of it.""

But there's one goal that he hasn't ticked off his list.

Despite sustaining a heel injury at Anfield earlier this season, Bowen is still eyeing an international call up for an England team that reached the side's first major final since 1966 at Euro 2020.

""Of course playing for England is a target of mine for sure, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't,"" Bowen tells CNN. ""I think I'm on the right path, so whether it happens now or in the future, I don't know, all I can do is play my game and do everything I can to try to please the England manager [Gareth Southgate].""

Asked if he hopes to join Southgate's squad at the FIFA World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in Qatar in December, Bowen says: ""One million percent.""

""Playing for your country in the best tournament; I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it, because why wouldn't I? It is still a long way to go but that's the dream.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/football/jarrod-bowen-west-ham-united-eintracht-frankfurt-spt-intl/index.html
43,Alex Honnold: 'Free Solo' star in new virtual reality series,"(CNN) Alex Honnold stunned the world when he climbed El Capitan without any safety ropes -- and now the climbing sensation is giving fans a front row seat to his free soloing skills.

Honnold is the star of a new two-part virtual reality (VR) series which follows him as he demonstrates his skills on unforgiving mountains in the Dolomites, Italy, and in his familiar stomping ground of the US.

Audiences, who require a Meta headset to watch the series, get to see Honnold shimmy up rock faces using just his hands and feet. Look down, and viewers get a very real sense of just how far he is off the ground.

""I'd never done anything in VR, so it seemed like an opportunity to do something new and interesting,"" Honnold told CNN Sport, speaking about the making of the 'Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR.'

""The real highlight of doing VR is that it allows people to really be there.""

Honnold was joined on the adventure by a number climbers, as well as series producer Jonathan Griffith

Griffith had already demonstrated the art of VR in a stunning project focused on Mount Everest, but the opportunity to work with the world-renowned Honnold was an exciting prospect.

Alex Honnold said he loved working on his first VR project.

'You never panic'

Griffith had worked with plenty of professional climbers but was impressed with how methodical Honnold was, which helped the producer feel more comfortable filming the sometimes death defying routes.

On occasion, Honnold is hanging on to the rock face with one hand, at other times he's seen hanging upside down with nothing between him and the ground.

While viewers can enjoy watching stunning sunsets and the beautiful orange light they throw across towering mountains, the series also shows Honnold climbing in the mist and cloud.

At one point, viewers are seemingly standing in the clouds as mist rolls in with Honnold climbing in an almost dream-like setting.

The show allows for a new appreciation of the strength, flexibility and mental fortitude which has made Honnold such a name.

""They're very thoughtful human beings,"" Griffith told CNN Sport when asked what it was like working with free soloists -- those who climb without ropes.

""And when they go and solo something, they don't just turn up and go crazy on it. There's an awful lot of planning and training and everything else that's gone in before they even set foot on the solo.

""So when you watch people like Alex solo, he's always in control. He's never panicking and terrified. I mean, that really would be terrifying to watch. But he's so calm on the rock when he's soloing.

""He just exudes confidence and chill when he's soloing, so you never panic.""

'Sharing with my family is the most important thing'

Griffith had his work cut out trying to capture Honnold and world-class alpinist Nicolas Hojac -- who helped guide the team through the Dolomites.

The equipment needed to shoot in virtual reality isn't light and was hauled up and down the rock faces wherever they went. The crew would then hide behind corners or rocks so viewers are left with an unspoilt view of Honnold climbing in these astonishing settings.

The camera itself, which weighs around 5.5 kilos, is actually made up of eight different cameras, allowing Griffith to shoot in 3D.

Then comes the rigging system which aims to get the camera as far away from the rock face as possible while still keeping the very expensive equipment safe and secure.

Griffith said it took the team over a year to mastermind the complex rigging system which can be set up while hanging off the side of a mountain.

But the outcome, Honnold says, was worth the extra effort.

""I'm not normally that impressed by soloing footage because, in general, the memory of the experience of something is more powerful than watching it on film,"" he says.

""But the VR experience is pretty close.

""Sharing with my family is the most important thing, having people close to me actually understand what we're doing and where we are and what it feels like.

""My mother-in-law has been watching the film five minutes at a time. She will watch five minutes and get all stressed out and put it away. And then the next day she will watch five more minutes.""

More to come

Given his standing, Honnold is asked to feature in numerous projects around the world but, it seems, working in VR with Griffith has captured his imagination.

The pair both seem excited about collaborating again and Honnold, named as a producer in the series, has ideas about what could come next.

""I've already floated some ideas to Jonathan,"" he laughed.

""I'm very proud of the final result. I think it's great. You know, honestly, if anybody would have us, I would happily do it again.

""The whole experience was great and I got to do a month of great climbing. I'm very, very pleased with the whole thing and I would happily do more of it.""

Griffith, who spent hours painstakingly going through the footage in post-production, said he'd also be keen after taking a break from such an intense and time consuming project.

""I feel like it'd be really hard now to better it because my brain is just like tons of sponge cake after that project,"" Griffith said.

""But I know, in about two months' time, I'll look back on it and I'll think 'we should have done that better and that could have been better' and I'll get totally psyched to do another one.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/sport/alex-honnold-solo-virtual-reality-spt-intl/index.html
44,Scottie Scheffler 'cried like a baby' before winning the Masters -- 'I was so stressed out',"(CNN) Suppositions, distractions or ""mentality monsters"" -- athletes deal with pressure in their own unique way.

Calmness in the face of adversity had been Scottie Scheffler's calling card over the first three days of the Masters

An errant shot didn't seem to bother him, almost losing his ball on the 54th hole was like water off a duck's back; even battling with his jacket around the Augusta National course during the third round seemed manageable, despite how awkward it looked in the blustery wind.

But with 18 holes standing between him and his first major victory and a famous green jacket, the pressure of being the Masters leader began to weigh.

Even with a three-shot advantage going into the final day, a supper snafu on the Saturday evening unsettled Scheffer.

""We (Scheffler and his wife, Meredith) went and got some food. I spilled my dinner in the car on the way home, and that was extraordinarily frustrating,"" a smiling Scheffler told the media.

""You can see Meredith is still laughing at me. She thought it was the funniest thing ever; I didn't think it was so funny at the time.""

Although he describes that evening as ""fine,"" the morning after was ""a totally different story.""

""I cried like a baby this morning. I was so stressed out,"" the 25-year-old explained. ""I didn't know what to do.

""I was sitting there telling Meredith: 'I don't think I'm ready for this. I'm not ready, I don't feel like I'm ready for this kind of stuff,' and I just felt overwhelmed. She told me: 'Who are you to say that you are not ready?' Gosh, it was a long morning.""

Scheffler speaks during the green jacket ceremony after winning the Masters.

'Peace'

It has been a transformative few months for the American.

In February, Scheffler didn't have a PGA Tour victory to his name. Now, he is a Masters champion and world No. 1.

He came into April's Masters as one of the favorites after a stretch of three wins in five tournament starts had catapulted him from PGA Tour journeyman to superstar.

Scheffler channeled that form at Augusta National, managing to remain calm under significant pressure.

While others crumbled around him, Scheffler maintained an even keel, despite his ""stomach hurting for two days straight,"" such was the growing pressure and sense of expectation.

Scheffler remembers that when he played at college and featured at a few US Opens, he used to ""have indigestion like the week and a half leading up to them"" and used to take pills to try and settle his stomach.

Asked afterwards why he felt so nervous before playing, Scheffler explained the prestige of the tournament played a part.

""I dreamed of having a chance to play in this golf tournament. I teared up the first time I got my invitation in the mail,"" he said. ""We were fortunate enough to play here in college, and I love this place.

""I love this golf course. If you're going to choose a golf tournament to win, this would be the tournament I would want to win. You don't know how many chances you're going to get.

""And so having a chance, I think I had a five-shot lead on Friday and then a three-shot lead going into Sunday, I don't know if you get better opportunities than that. You don't want to waste them.

""The human condition is to make things bigger than they really are. And years from now, I would say people may not remember me as a champion, and that's fine. But in the moment, you think it's a lot bigger deal than it really is.""

But as has often been the case for Scheffler, he found ""peace"" out on the course.

""I think the hardest stuff is off the golf course. When I'm out there and once we get into the round, pretty much after parring the first hole I was settled in. I felt good.""

Scheffler plays his shot on the ninth hole during the final round of the Masters.

A champion

Battling tough weather conditions during the opening three rounds, Scheffler was able to build a sizeable lead and held a three-shot advantage over Australian Cameron Smith heading into Sunday.

After a few nervy opening holes, in which Smith narrowed the lead to just one, Scheffler reasserted his dominance, starting with a delightful chip-in on the third hole for a birdie.

While others faltered and slipped away, Scheffler never looked fazed and slowly tightened his grip on his debut major.

""It was definitely nice to build up a lead. Nothing is safe out there on the back nine on this golf course.

""I've heard all the things that everybody says, it doesn't start till the back nine on Sunday, anything can happen, don't hit in the water on 12, all the stuff. I just blocked most of that out and tried to execute and hit good golf shots.""

Scheffler celebrates on the 18th green after winning the Masters.

It was only on the 18th green of the Sunday, with his lead unassailable and the green jacket being fitted for his measurements, that Scheffler felt able to relax.

""I didn't break my concentration until we got onto the green on 18. Once we got on to the green, I was like: 'All right, I'm going to enjoy this.'""

Left with just a short par putt to etch his name into the history book, Scheffler missed by the smallest of margins, leaving himself another short putt to wrap it up.

Then to the surprise of everyone watching -- and Scheffler himself -- his putt hit the rim of the cup before veering away.

""Hard to believe what you've just seen,"" Sky Sports commentator Ewen Murray said in bewilderment.

Scheffler was finally able to roll home that winning putt, with the crowd erupting in celebration as the latest Masters champion was crowned.

Scheffler shared emotional moments with wife Meredith and father Scott as he made his way off the green, shortly before trying on his latest item of clothing -- the green jacket given to the winner of the Masters.

Scheffler kisses his wife, Meredith, after winning the Masters.

""The reason why I play golf is I'm trying to glorify God and all that He's done in my life. So for me, my identity isn't a golf score,"" added Scheffler.

""Like Meredith told me this morning: 'If you win this golf tournament today, if you lose this golf tournament by 10 shots, if you never win another golf tournament again,' she goes, 'I'm still going to love you, you're still going to be the same person, Jesus loves you and nothing changes.'

""All I'm trying to do is glorify God and that's why I'm here ... it's not about a golf score.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/golf/scottie-scheffler-masters-win-gotm-spt-intl/index.html
45,Didier Drogba: Chelsea great hopes club's new owners can 'carry on the vision and passion of the fans',"(CNN) Chelsea great Didier Drogba has said he hopes the club's new owners , whoever they will be, will ""carry on the vision and the passion of the of the fans.""

In March, Chelsea owner and Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich announced he planned to sell the club in the best interests of ""the fans, the employees, as well as the Club's sponsors and partners.""

Abramovich's decision to sell the club came after he declared he gave ""stewardship"" of Chelsea to trustees of the club's charitable foundation.

Afterward, the European Union placed Abramovich on its list of sanctioned individuals, while the UK government sanctioned him as part of its efforts to ""isolate"" Russian President Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Abramovich has always denied being linked to Putin and rejected claims that any of his activities merited government sanctions.

Three final bids are under consideration to take ownership of the club, and Drogba -- who scored over 100 Premier League goals for Chelsea -- wants the new owners to prioritize matching the fans' high level of expectations on the pitch.

""I think for the new people coming in, I don't know what lessons to give them, but as an ex-player of the club, as a Chelsea fan, we just want them to carry on the vision and the passion of the fans because the fans are, they're still here and also the people who have been working at the club, have done a great job,"" Drogba told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies

Drogba became a fan favorite at Chelsea for being the talismanic striker in Jose Mourinho's transformative first spell at the club.

After signing in 2004, he scored numerous key goals for the club, including the equalizer and the winning penalty in the 2012 Champions League final, as well as winning four Premier League titles, four FA Cups and three League Cups in his two stints at the club.

The 44-year-old says seeing the club ""suffering"" under the sanctions placed on it is hard.

""We're talking the club where I played for nine years and where I won so many trophies, I made so many friends. I'm in the administration, players, the staff, the managers, the owner, everybody, everybody,"" he explained.

Roman Abramovich sits in his box before Chelsea's Premier League match against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge on December 19, 2015.

""And to see the club suffering from these sanctions as a result of the crisis in Ukraine is a pity because I believe football has nothing to do with this.

""I sometimes question the decisions, the sanctions of the club, not letting the club operating at its full capacity is a big mistake.

""When you, when you sanction a club like that, you want to sanction maybe Roman Abramovich and his supposedly relations with Mr. Vladimir Putin, but I think you are creating more damage to the club's people, the workers, who are English as well, who are European as well who live for the club. You are sanctioning the fans who travel every day for many, many years to make this club alive.

""And I believe no matter what happened, the club will still be there. Chelsea will still be one of the biggest clubs in the world and because of the legacy that has been built in the past 15 years and before that as well. But the past 15 years have been so successful that nobody can take this away from us.""

The future

Drogba himself is making steps into his next role in football and was speaking ahead of a potential momentous day.

The former Ivory Coast international is one of six candidates in the running to be next president of the country's football federation (FIF).

A process that was originally scheduled to take place in September 2020 but has been delayed for numerous reasons, the candidates will finally face a vote on April 23.

Ahead of the vote, Drogba told CNN that he is ""really confident"" of being voted to a position where he hopes to ""unite around a vision of a football that brings us together and leads us to victories.""

Drogba -- who earned more than 100 caps for the Ivory Coast national team and played in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups -- believes that a more organized national set up can lead to more success on the pitch.

""I've been around many, many countries, many continents, and I've seen a lot, a lot of African talent everywhere I've been,"" he said. ""Just look at the France national team who won the World Cup (in 2018).

""I would say 70-80% of them are not born in Africa, but originally from Africa, from the parents or they're born in Africa. And then they went to France, like at a very young age. We have those talents here.

Drogba during the charity ""Heroes"" match between former Olympique de Marseille's players and Team Unicef at the Velodrome stadium in Marseille on October 13, 2021.

""What we don't really do is to put a team around them to let them understand that they have the qualities. It's just a question of organization.

Drogba says he faced opposition to standing for election, saying his presence was ""disturbing"" the ""system (that) was in place for more than 25 years.""

Beyond reorganizing the national team system, Drogba also points to revolutionizing the woman's side of the game in the country, as well as players being paid on time, if he was to be elected.

""We don't have a women' league. The women's league is played in two weeks,"" he said.

""You have to know that here the players are paid less and $25-30 a month when they are paid. And so what do they do?

""And this doesn't sound logical to me, and that's one of the reasons why I come into the game and I surprised everyone.

""And they're not ready for my candidacy because obviously the population is behind me.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/football/didier-drogba-chelsea-ivory-coast-spt-intl/index.html
46,Daniel Kinahan: Alleged head of 'murderous organization' with links to boxing targeted by US government,"(CNN) The US Department of State is offering rewards of up to $5 million for information leading to each of the arrests of three Irish ""transnational organized criminals,"" notably Daniel Kinahan, who has wielded significant influence in the boxing world in recent years.

According to a US Department of State announcement on Tuesday, the Kinahan Transnational Criminal Organization has engaged in narcotics trafficking, money laundering, firearms trafficking and murder.

Kinahan's links to boxing come through his former ties to the agency MTK Global, an organization whose most prestigious client is heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, who is due to fight Dillian Whyte in a world title bout on April 23 in London.

Mr. Kinahan's lawyer told the BBC that Kinahan has no criminal record or convictions and the allegations about him being a crime boss are false and have no evidential basis.

The lawyer said: ""In so far as our client's record in boxing is concerned, he is proud of his record in boxing to date.""

Legendary boxing promoter Bob Arum, CEO and founder of Las Vegas-based Top Rank, Inc., is promoting Fury's fight with Whyte together with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions.

According to the Mail Online, Arum said that Fury has been told by Warren that their future dealings will not include Kinahan.

""I'm a US citizen and the Treasury department does not take these steps lightly,"" Arum told the Mail. ""We will respect them (sanctions preventing Kinahan doing business in the US).

""We are not going to deal with Kinahan and his people. We will deal directly (with Fury) or his lawyer Robert Davis.""

The US Department of State's $5 million reward followed the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announcement on Monday that it has imposed sanctions on Kinahan, describing the Irishman as one of the leaders of the Kinahan Organized Crime Group (KOCG).

The OFAC described the KOCG as ""a murderous organization involved in the international trafficking of drugs and firearms.""

The investigation was a collaboration between the OFAC and multiple US agencies, Ireland's national police force, the UK's National Crime Agency, and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, the OFAC release said.

The OFAC said that ""each member of the KOCG reports to Daniel Kinahan, who is believed to run the day-to-day operations of the organization.""

According to the OFAC, Kinahan is based in Dubai.

Top Rank Founder and CEO Bob Arum (L) and boxer Tyson Fury laugh during a news conference at MGM Grand Hotel & Casino on September 11, 2019 in Las Vegas.

'Getting this deal over the line'

The OFAC's sanctions also affect a number of Kinahan associates, notably Ian Dixon, who owns or controls ""directly or indirectly, Hoopoe Sports LLC.""

Hoopoe Sports is a UAE-based sports management and advisory company, according to the OFAC.

Hoopoe Sports' website says it has an ""expertise in professional combat sports (Boxing & MMA) and an enviable record of success among its advised fighters.""

Dixon did not respond to CNN's request for comment via email.

In 2020, Fury made a point of thanking Kinahan in an Instagram video for ""getting this deal over the line"" to potentially fight fellow British boxer Anthony Joshua in 2021. The two did not eventually fight.

Subsequently, Ireland's then Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar told the Irish Parliament he was ""taken aback"" to see Fury using Kinahan's name in his video ""as if this was somebody who did not have quite a chequered history in this State and elsewhere.""

The law firm representing Kinahan did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the OFAC's announcement. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the allegations made against Kinahan.

In a statement given on Thursday, MTK Global said that it ""will comply fully with the sanctions made by the US government against Daniel Kinahan ... We will cooperate fully with all authorities and assist with any ongoing investigations.""

Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions is working with Bob Arum and Top Rank on Tyson Fury's fight with Dillian Whyte in London on April 23.

The current CEO and President of MTK Global, Bob Yalen, is quoted in the statement as saying: ""MTK Global will take every measure to ensure the company, and those who deal with it are fully compliant with the US sanctions announced this week and take this matter extremely seriously.""

In previous MTK statement given in 2020, then MTK Global CEO Sandra Vaughan said that Kinahan ""hasn't got anything to do with MTK Global.""

In the same statement, Vaughan explained that fighters will often had independent advisors adding that the organization had been able to sign Fury because he was ""recommended"" to them by Kinahan.

""It happens all the time and I hope it continues to happen,"" Vaughan said. ""As long as we fulfill what Daniel says about us being a great management company and keep doing the best for the fighters as much as we can, hopefully we'll continue to get recommendations from Daniel.""

'A threat to the entire licit economy'

The OFAC sanctions announced on Monday targeted seven individuals, including Kinahan.

According to the OFAC, the KOCG emerged in the late 1990s and became the ""most powerful organized crime group operating in Ireland.""

The group has links to international money laundering and has been ""involved in a gang war with another group in Ireland and Spain, resulting in numerous murders,"" said the OFAC.

According to the UK's NCA, recent investigations have caused ""major disruption"" to the KOCG's activities.

The OFAC sanctions, which target Daniel and two other Kinahan family members as well as several associates, announced on Monday mean that ""all property and interests in property of the designated individuals or entities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC.""​

In the announcement, the OFAC said that Daniel Kinahan ""was designated for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the KOCG.""

Kinahan is based in Dubai, according to the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

""Kinahan has instructed KOCG members to send money to a variety of individuals serving prison sentences, including a person convicted of attempted murder on behalf of the KOCG, and an individual imprisoned for murder on behalf of the KOCG,"" alleged the OFAC statement.

""Kinahan, who sources large quantities of cocaine from South America, plays an integral part in organizing the supply of drugs in Ireland, and is attempting to facilitate the importation of cocaine into the United Kingdom. Daniel Kinahan is known to have used false identity documents,"" added the OFAC statement.

""The Kinahan Organized Crime Group smuggles deadly narcotics, including cocaine, to Europe, and is a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering,"" said Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.

""Criminal groups like the KOCG prey on the most vulnerable in society and bring drug-related crime and violence, including murder, to the countries in which they operate.""

48,Jordan Spieth claims first win of season at RBC Heritage while Dylan Frittelli hits wild shot out of tree,"(CNN) Jordan Spieth claimed his first win of the season at the RBC Heritage after a dramatic playoff victory over Patrick Cantlay.

The American beat his compatriot on the first hole of their sudden-death playoff at Harbour Town Golf Links, recording a par while Cantlay could only register a bogey.

It capped off a remarkable Sunday for Spieth, who roared into contention with a five-under 66 -- including two eagles in the opening five holes -- setting the clubhouse lead at 13-under par.

Cantlay carded a final-round 68 to join Spieth at the top of the leaderboard, but after both players found the bunker on the 18th hole in the playoff, Spieth produced a moment of magic from the sand to claim his 13th PGA Tour victory with FedExCup champion Cantlay only able to find the back of the green with his bunker shot.

Afterwards, three-time major winner Spieth praised his wife, Annie, for instilling some calm in him after a disappointing round on Saturday.

The former world number one was lining up his swing during the second round of the South Carolina PGA Tour event when a deer broke from the trees and proceeded to prance down the Harbor Town Golf Links' fairway.

Any hopes of the special guest making par were dashed as the deer ended up in a bunker, its brief cameo at the event capped by a trot back up the fairway before a return to the bushes it had emerged from, footage tweeted by the PGA Tour showed.

50,Real Madrid wins 35th La Liga title with 4-0 win against Espanyol,"(CNN) Real Madrid wrapped up the La Liga title with a comprehensive 4-0 victory against Espanyol on Saturday.

It is Real's second league title in three years and one Carlo Ancelotti's side has claimed with relative ease having moved an unassailable 18 points ahead of Barcelona -- which has five games left to play this season.

Rodrygo scored twice in the first half before Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema added two more goals in the second half to complete a comfortable victory at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.

51,West Ham investigating incident after fans allegedly attack German commentators live on air,"(CNN) West Ham United are investigating an incident in which two German commentators were allegedly attacked inside the London Stadium during the team's Europa League semifinal first leg against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.

Tim Brockmeier and Philipp Hofmeister, working for German broadcaster Hessischer Runfunk, said their headsets were ripped off and that they were physically assaulted by West Ham fans after Michail Antonio had equalized for the hosts in the first half.

The pair said the West Ham fans were sitting directly behind them and had been angered by them cheering loudly when Frankfurt took the lead in the first minute of the match.

The incident was captured on the live broadcast.

""We are being attacked from behind by the English fans, that's why we were unfortunately gone for a short time,"" Hofmeister said on the broadcast.

52,Emma Raducanu says split from coach Torben Beltz was a 'tough' decision,"(CNN) British tennis star Emma Raducanu says it was a ""tough"" decision to split with coach Torben Beltz after only five months together.

The 19-year-old, who stunned the tennis world by winning the US Open as a qualifier last year, is now searching for a fourth coach in less than year.

Raducanu's split from the German came as a surprise to many as she continues her buildup on clay ahead of her first French Open appearance next month.

""Torben is a very great guy,"" she told reporters ahead of this week's Madrid Open. ""I really enjoyed my time with him on and off the court.

""He is one of the nicest people I've met, so obviously it was a tough one to split with someone like that, but I feel like right now I'm very comfortable with my current training.

53,Wimbledon 2022: Organizers feared Russian participation would fuel a 'propaganda machine',"Wimbledon (CNN) Banning Russian and Belarusian tennis players from this year's Wimbledon tournament in light of the war in Ukraine is not discriminatory, say organizers of the grand slam tournament.

The tournament's chairman Ian Hewitt said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had placed organizers in ""an extreme and exceptional situation,"" adding that the decision to implement a player ban had been made in line with UK government directives.

Those directives meant that players from Russia and Belarus would not be able play at the tournament, which begins on June 27, based on their rankings position alone, but would need to agree to a written declaration against the war in Ukraine

""First, even if we were to accept entries from Russian and Belarusian players with written declarations, we would risk their success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime, which we could not accept,"" Hewitt told reporters on Tuesday.

""Second, we have a duty to ensure that no actions we take should put the safety of players or their families at risk.

54,Novak Djokovic to defend Wimbledon title as organizers allow unvaccinated players to compete,"(CNN) Novak Djokovic will be able to defend his Wimbledon title this summer after tournament organizers said that players who are unvaccinated against Covid-19 can compete at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).

The world No. 1 was not permitted to play at the Australian Open in January after twice having his visa revoked due to his unvaccinated status, and Djokovic told the BBC earlier this year he was willing to miss out on other tournaments if they required him to be vaccinated.

""The requirements set out by government to enter the UK do not include mandatory vaccination,"" Sally Bolton, chief executive of the AELTC, told reporters on Tuesday. ""Therefore, whilst of course it is encouraged, it will not be a condition of entry to compete at the Championships this year.""

After his deportation from Australia, Djokovic went on to miss the Masters 1000 events at Indian Well and Miami due to the United States' Covid-19 entry rules.

The 20-time grand slam champion, who is bidding for his seventh Wimbledon title, reached his first final of the year at the Serbian Open last week, but lost to Andrey Rublev.

55,MLB suspends Dodgers' Trevor Bauer for two seasons,"(CNN) Major League Baseball announced it has suspended Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer for two years, for violation of the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy, which Bauer has consistently denied.

In a statement, Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said following an extensive investigation, Bauer has received a suspension for 324 championship season games (representing two full seasons) without pay, effective Friday. The league did not disclose details of its investigation.

In a post on Twitter, Bauer, 31, said, ""In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league's domestic violence & sexual assault policy. I am appealing this action and expect to prevail.""

Bauer has not played since June of last year, when a San Diego woman came forward with assault allegations against the pitcher. He was placed on paid, administrative leave by the league the following month. Any suspension under the domestic violence policy would mean Bauer would not receive any pay.

The 27-year-old California woman who made the allegations said in legal documents over the summer while she had consented to sex with Bauer on two occasions, she alleged he did things to her she did not agree or consent to during both encounters. Bauer's representatives denied the allegations.

In February, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Bauer would not face criminal charges for the sexual assault accusations.

""After a thorough review of all the available evidence including the civil restraining order proceedings, witness statements and the physical evidence, the People are unable to prove the relevant charges beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Deputy District Attorney Fernanda Barreto wrote at the time.

The MLB's policy on domestic violence, sexual abuse and child abuse says players may face ""disciplinary action for just cause by the Commissioner for a violation of this Policy in the absence of a conviction or a plea of guilty to a crime involving a Covered Act.""

The acts covered under the league's sexual assault policy are defined as ""a range of behaviors, including a completed nonconsensual sex act, an attempted nonconsensual sex act, and/or nonconsensual sexual contact.""

Bauer has also denied allegations published in August by The Washington Post from an Ohio woman that claimed Bauer assaulted her without her consent during sex on more than one occasion. The Post was provided with photographs of injuries to the woman's face and also viewed messages that Bauer had allegedly sent to the woman, ranging from threats of revealing private video to physical violence. Bauer at the time called the allegations a ""false narrative"" and his co-agents said Bauer and the woman had a ""wholly consensual relationship.""

Following the MLB announcement of Bauer's suspension on Friday, the Dodgers said in a statement , their organization takes ""all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault.""

""We've cooperated fully with MLB's investigation since it began, and we fully support MLB's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse Policy, and the Commissioner's enforcement of the Policy,"" the team said in a statement. ""We understand that Trevor has the right to appeal the Commissioner's decision.""

""Therefore, we will not comment further until the process is complete,"" the team added.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/sport/trevor-bauer-dodgers-suspension-spt/index.html
56,Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid out indefinitely with orbital fracture and mild concussion,"(CNN) Philadelphia 76ers' center Joel Embiid is out indefinitely after suffering an orbital fracture and mild concussion during Thursday's series-clinching win over the Toronto Raptors, the team said Friday.

Embiid suffered the injury late in the fourth quarter while defending Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. He went to the bench and did not return. The 28-year-old center was already playing through a torn ligament in his right thumb he suffered earlier in the Toronto series.

Still, he finished the game with 33 points and 10 rebounds.

The 76ers are scheduled to begin the second-round Eastern Conference semifinal series on the road against the Miami Heat on Monday.

Last week, Embiid hit a clutch three-pointer with less than a second remaining to seal a 104-101 overtime win, extending the Sixers' series lead over the Raptors.

58,Max Verstappen dominates to win the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as Ferrari struggles,"(CNN) Max Verstappen dominated the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as Red Bull clinched a one-two at Imola on Sunday.

The reigning world champion , who started on pole, dealt with a wet start and stayed out of trouble for much of the race to close the gap at the top of the driver standings to 27 points.

Teammate Sergio Perez finished second after Ferrari's Charles Leclerc spun off the track having threatened to disrupt the Red Bull shutout in the closing stages.

In truth, it was a race to forget for Ferrari, who saw Carlos Sainz crash out on the first lap and championship leader Leclerc finish down in sixth after his mistake.

It was extra disappointing given the amount of support the home team had in Italy this weekend.

59,Italian Police seize properties belonging to former Haas F1 driver Nikita Mazepin,"(CNN) Italy has seized properties valued at €105 million ($114.32 million) belonging to Nikita Mazepin and his oligarch father Dmitry, Italian financial police confirmed in a statement Monday.

The former Haas driver and his father are included on a list of individuals sanctioned by the EU in early March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Mazepin Sr. was described by the EU as ""a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin"" since he was invited by the Russian president to a February meeting of 36 other business people to discuss how sanctions would impact Russia.

A statement from the Italian financial police read: ""A real estate asset worth approximately 105 million euro has been frozen because the property is attributable to the Russian billionaire Dmitry Arkadievich Mazepin and his son Nikita Dmitrievich Mazepin, until March 5 a Formula 1 driver of the Haas F1 Team.

Verstappen slipped to sixth in the overall standings, 46 points behind the Monegasque driver, who won Sunday's race by more than 20 seconds over Verstappen's teammate, Sergio Pérez.

""We're already miles behind,"" Verstappen said after the race to F1. ""I don't even want to think about the championship fight at the moment. I think it's more important to finish races.""

After qualifying in second place, Verstappen was forced to retire on Lap 39 of 58 due to a suspected fuel leak. Even before his retirement, the Dutchman was unable to challenge Leclerc who cruised to victory.

""Of course, today was in general just a bad day again,"" Verstappen continued, ""Just not really having the pace. I was just managing my tires, trying to just bring it to the end because it looked like quite an easy P2 anyway.""

62,Ukrainian skeleton star goes from Winter Olympics to war zone in weeks,"(CNN) Last month, Ukraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych was a skeleton racer hurtling his way around the Yanqing Sliding Centre at the Beijing Winter Olympics . Six weeks later, he was in a war zone handing out medical supplies as rockets were shot out of the sky over his head.

Heraskevych made headlines in Beijing when he held up a ""No War in Ukraine"" banner to protest the impending Russian invasion, a nightmare realized when the conflict began less than two weeks later.

Since then -- as has been the case for so many of his compatriots -- the 23-year-old's life has been turned upside down.

In the capital of Kyiv on the day of the invasion, Heraskevych had initially tried to enlist in the Ukrainian army but was unable to do so as all positions had been filled and he lacked military experience.

Heraskevych slides during the fourth heat at the Beijing Games on February 11.

Determined to do his part, Heraskevych returned to his father's hometown of Zhytomir from Kyiv on Monday, having driven a van 150 kilometers to hand out medical supplies and food.

""I was close to fire points, you can literally see rockets -- Russian rockets -- being destroyed by our Ukrainian air defense,"" Heraskevych told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""It's very scary and absolutely crazy that now in the 21st century, in the middle of Europe, we can see this. We need to stop this war.""

With many of the roads destroyed, what would typically have been a three-hour drive took more than seven.

Regular checks from the Ukrainian military to inspect passport documents and baggage dotted the journey, with scenery frequently marked by destroyed buildings, as well as burnt vehicles.

""You see a lot of destroyed cars because a lot of spies -- Russian spies -- try to move in the city and our military try to stop them,"" Heraskevych said.

'You can't be ready for war'

Heraskevych's volunteering efforts have formed part of his broader goal to help his people by use of his platform as an athlete, a profession and a former life that now seem a million miles away.

As Russian troops amassed at the Ukrainian border in early February, the 23-year-old's sign in Beijing -- held up to television cameras at the end of a run -- proved to be one of the defining moments of the Games.

Heraskevych holds a sign with a message reading 'No war in Ukraine' during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in February.

However, Heraskevych admitted that, at the time, he didn't expect events back home to escalate so far, so fast.

""At that moment, when I showed the sign, we knew that a lot of troops were near our borders, but you can't be ready for war,"" Heraskevych said.

""You can't expect it. Till the end, till the 24th of February, all Ukraine and the whole world expects that world war doesn't start -- it's an absolutely crazy feeling.

""A lot of deaths in the country, a lot of friends already being lost ... it's an absolute nightmare.""

Using his platform

Since returning from Beijing, he has worked with Global Athlete, an international start-up movement created and run by athletes to ""inspire and lead positive change in world sport.""

Heraskevych added that he has spoken to a number of fellow athletes to discuss the conflict, alongside a number of media appearances to raise awareness of his country's plight.

""I've just been trying to work in my area, in sports,"" Heraskevych said.

""Everything feels so far away. Your whole life you try to achieve something and you go step by step, but this ladder is broken now and now your whole life goes in a different direction.

""Athletics feels so far away and not necessary at all, I just have to focus on the life of my family and my friends, my own life and the lives of other Ukrainians. I just think about how to stop the war and these many victims.""

Heraskevych is keen to use his platform as an athlete to inspire change.

In a video shared to his Instagram on Friday, Heraskevych said that he would ""never forget those who kept silent about the war,"" and the skeleton star is particularly confused by the response of some fellow athletes.

""I can't understand why they stay quiet or why they support this war,"" Heraskevych said. ""It's super scary for me.

""I just don't understand it because it's people who I know and they stay quiet. I'm sure that they know what is happening now.""

'It's crazy to support the killing of your friends'

Earlier this month, Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak was widely criticized outside of his country -- and by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for "" shocking behavior "" -- for wearing the pro-war 'Z' symbol on a podium next to a Ukrainian athlete.

Meanwhile, swimwear maker Speedo has recently ended its sponsorship deal with two-time Olympic gold medal swimmer Evgeny Rylov after the Russian attended a rally hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

For Heraskevych, athletes that support the war and Putin are a ""powerful tool"" of Russian propaganda and should be banned from international sport.

""They are very powerful tool of Russian politics and propaganda and when these people support war, a lot of people in Russia also start to support this war,"" Heraskevych said.

""It's unbelievable when you see the posts of the athletes you compete with, and they support the war, I mean I understand that propaganda works but it's crazy, it's crazy to support the killing of your friends.""

""They should be banned ... because the main mission of sport is to bring peace and unity to the world, not war.""

For now, Heraskevych is content to do what he can and ensure the continued safety of his family in Zhytomir. Though the city suffered intense shelling earlier this month and the sounds of the conflict are still within earshot, Heraskevych said it is ""quiet"" compared to other areas of the country.

However, he insists that if called upon, he will defend Ukraine ""in the way that is needed.""

""If needed, I will go and defend my country in the way that is needed, but everyday the situation changes very quickly.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/sport/vladyslav-heraskevych-skeleton-ukraine-russia-spt-intl/index.html
63,Kaillie Humphries: World's top female bobsledder says she switched to US team after fearing for her 'physical safety',"(CNN) Any time Kaillie Humphries wishes, the world's top female bobsledder can gaze into the mirror and look back on her remarkable career; the artwork that adorns most of her body reminds her of the whole story.

""Tattoos are a big representation of who I am,"" the 36-year-old three-time Olympic champion told CNN Sport . ""I've got my mom and my dad, their portraits. I have Olympic medals, my hopes, goals and dreams. With each one I get, I personally feel more complete.""

But it will require a truly skilled artist to fully capture the latest chapter of her life, an extraordinary drama both on and off the track; an emotional roller coaster which saw her uprooted from Canada, switching her allegiance to the United States.

To do so, Kaillie Humphries had to face her demons and slay the dragon.

It's been three years since Humphries turned her back on the Canadian team with which she'd won two Olympic titles and 10 World Cup medals.

After 16 years with the national team, she says that her work environment suddenly felt dangerous. ""I feared for my physical safety,"" she told CNN, adding that whenever she stood up for herself, she feared it could lead to ""a punch in the face.""

""It was an environment I feared being in,"" she added. ""And it culminated in not only depression, but physical issues, rashes, hives. I was having panic attacks.""

Up until 2018, Humphries says she enjoyed working with ""amazing coaches"" on the Canadian team.

But she says she never got to choose who they were, and in 2018 everything changed at just the time she was hoping to make history at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.

Humphries believes she has at least one more Olympics in her. Picture courtesy of Taylor Mohr, Taylor Mohr Photography.

""I went from being the Olympic champion, trying to be the first athlete to defend for three Olympics in a row, to not recognizing myself or wanting to leave the house and being scared for my safety.""

Despite all her considerable success, Humphries says that the arrival of a new coach, Todd Hays, in the lead-up to the 2018 Olympics, led to her being ""targeted, harassed and bullied.""

Humphries thought she'd seen it all and was equipped to handle anything that could be thrown at her, but says she was crippled by the anxiety of being forced to work with somebody she found to be aggressive and physically intimidating.

When she filed a complaint against her coach, the President of Canada's Bobsled and Skeleton governing body (BCS) and another staff member, her concerns were passed to an independent investigator and ultimately dismissed.

Humphries was told that there was insufficient evidence to justify her claims. Humphries then appealed, and according to the New York Times, an arbitrator ruled that the investigation had been inadequate and another inquiry is still ongoing.

Speaking through his attorney, Hays issued a strenuous denial of Humphries' allegations. He said that contrary to Humphries' claims, she ""made specific demands"" that he should be one of her coaches.

Hays' attorney also rejected any suggestion of impropriety: ""At no time has Mr. Hays targeted, harassed, or bullied Ms. Humphries, nor has he acted aggressively or in a physically intimidating manner towards her.""

The statement concluded that Hays would make no further comment, respecting the confidentiality of the ongoing legal proceedings.

""I was courageous enough to stand up and say I felt unsafe,"" Humphries said. ""And as [with] most athletes in that environment, they're usually not believed, not trusted and shoved aside.""

A photo of Humphries working out, courtesy of iFIT Health & Fitness and Colleen Logan, VP PR and Corporate Communications.

In 2019, Humphries quit the team and decided to race instead for the United States, knowing that it could mean the end of her Olympic dreams.

On March 7, it was revealed that Humphries wasn't the only athlete with concerns about the working conditions of the athletes in Canada's bobsled and skeleton team.

More than 60 of them, who have been competing since 2014, signed an open letter, calling for the resignation of senior BCS figures.

They cited a ""toxic"" environment in what is a dangerous, high-speed sport. The third sentence cut right to the chase: ""Too many athletes have suffered physically, mentally, emotionally and financially due to the organization's failure to address these issues, jeopardizing the future of both sports.""

Humphries responded to the news on Twitter, writing, ""I know what these athletes are going through. This is the exact same leadership I dealt with and had to leave to escape it. Proud they are standing up and telling their truths. Change is needed.""

CNN spoke with several sliding athletes, who described their own experience on the Canadian team. They spoke of a culture of negligence and fear of retribution for anybody who dared to raise any concerns.

The retired bobsledder Neville Wright said, ""If we keep going in this direction, we're going to end up in a situation with career or life-threatening injuries and maybe, in the worst case, suicide.""

The retired skeleton athlete Elisabeth Maier says that she has been fighting the federation over claims of harassment and discrimination for four years.

In response, BCS accused her of making ""false and gravely defamatory"" statements about the organization and issued her with a cease and desist letter.

""When I put in my original complaint,"" she recalls, ""I went to bed that night hoping I wouldn't wake up. When someone f**ks with your mental health that heavy and for that long, you believe the worst stuff about yourself.""

Humphries and Kaysha Love of Team United States celebrate during the 2-woman Bobsled Heat 4 on day 15 of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games on February 19, 2022.

Her voice breaking with emotion, she continued, ""There have been three instances where I have genuinely thought about hurting myself or the scary thoughts come in, and they're all related back to BCS.""

Madison Charney, another skeleton athlete, was also emotional as she recalled her experience on the team.

""We live in a constant state of fear of speaking out against the program, the fear that you're going to be cut from the program,"" said Charney, who added that competing for Canada was like being in an abusive relationship.

""One side is always assuming they're in the wrong, and always being told they're sh**ty. They're wrong, they'll never be heard, no one will ever believe them. I'm hearing other athletes now say that being cut from the program was 'the best thing that ever happened to me.'""

Humphries is seen in an Instagram post dated March 6, 2022 attending a concert at the Petco Park Stadium in San Diego.

In response to the open letter, BCS issued a statement and said that efforts were already underway to address the issues that had been raised.

""We take the concerns of our athletes seriously,"" read the statement. ""As we do at the completion of every Olympic quadrennial, we plan to meet with our athlete community directly as soon as possible to review and address their concerns.""

But the athletes quickly dismissed the response from BCS and issued another open letter, revealing that their campaign is also now growing in strength.

This time signed by 82 athletes, they wrote: ""Time and again, BCS has controlled the narrative on our complaints and has failed to address the underlying systemic causes of these issues -- resulting in further preservation of the status quo.""

The athletes have repeated their demands for a ""truly independent"" investigation and the immediate resignation of senior BCS figures.

""The BCS Board acknowledges receipt of two anonymous letters from current and former BCS athletes,"" said the BCS Board of Directors in statement sent to CNN on March 16.

""We are committed to identifying and resolving the issues brought forward by athletes through a forum that encourages open dialogue and transparency, including the participation of BCS athletes and staff as well as other stakeholders who can bring valuable perspective.

""We believe that constructive dialogue and a clear action plan will bring about positive change. An independent mediation process has been initiated. Athletes will be invited to participate in all aspects, including shaping the mediation process and sharing their views.

""The BCS Board hopes that athletes will participate in this opportunity. As an independent supporter of sport, Own the Podium supports this initiative as a path to encourage discussion and find solutions. We look forward to engaging in meaningful dialogue in a setting that promotes openness and fairness for all.""

'Humbling experience'

As the most successful female bobsledder in the business, Humphries went from being on top of the world to rock bottom.

""It was a humbling experience,"" she told CNN. ""I had to walk away from a long career where I had everything built up, to go back to ground zero. Nothing. No sponsors, no support, no funding.""

She found a home with Team USA -- her husband is an American citizen -- winning three more world championship titles; but her Olympic status was in limbo.

The International Olympic Committee won't allow an athlete to compete under the flag of a country unless they hold full citizenship. She's critical of such rigid regulations, which she says forced her to choose either a safe working environment, or potentially, another shot at the Olympics.

""Why do I have to choose a human right over being able to do my job?"" she asked. ""The IOC wasn't willing to bend on that.""

As an athlete, who had spent her life racing against the clock, Humphries was now in a race against time for her citizenship.

""Give me an Olympic performance any day over having to wait for an immigration letter, or answer questions, or submit paperwork. It was extremely nerve wracking, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a couple of meltdowns if it wasn't for my husband.

""I do not for one second regret the decision I made to leave Team Canada. And I reminded myself of that every single day. I am in a much better place mentally and physically, and if I don't go to the Olympics, I don't go.""

There's nothing quite like that gold medal winning feeling ... Humphries poses during the women's monobob bobsled medal ceremony on day 10 of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games.

But at the start of December, and with barely two months to go until the Games in Beijing, Humphries became an American citizen. In February, she was an Olympic champion again, winning the inaugural monobob competition.

""I was a lot more emotional than I thought I would be,"" she recalled. ""There was no guarantee that I would have the opportunity to compete.

""My citizenship came in last minute. I had to have a lot of faith in myself, my family, the program, my sponsors, my support. The community really got behind me and so I definitely felt all that love.""

With the nightmare of her time on Team Canada now fully behind her, Humphries is looking to the future.

She believes that she has at least one more Olympics in her, the 2026 Games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, when she'll be 40. If the 2030 Games end up being hosted by Salt Lake City, she might be persuaded to race one more time and call time on her career on home ice.

But in the meantime, there are more immediate matters: finding the right kind of ink to commemorate the latest chapter of her life in her own personal art gallery.

She says there will be an American theme, naturally, but also a representation of the beast that she slayed.

""The bobsled track in Beijing was called the 'Flying Snow Dragon' and I felt like I conquered the dragon while I was there. So I'm probably going to look to get a dragon tattoo.""

It's an image that could also be a metaphor for everything else that she's experienced in the last few years.

Taken by photographer Troy Conrad, this photo of Humphries appeared in Inked Magazine and featured on her Instagram account.

Will it hurt getting the tattoo?

""Yeah, they're not nice,"" she responds, ""Kind of like being an athlete. There's a bunch of pain for a bunch of glory at the end. You can't have the great things in life without going through some hard times, and tattoos are no exception.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/sport/kaillie-humphries-interview-spt-intl/index.html

65,Jockey Chris Caserta presumed dead after being caught in rip current,"(CNN) Australian jockey Chris Caserta is presumed dead after being caught in a rip current during a late-night swim, Queensland Police said on Thursday.

Shortly after 10 p.m. on Wednesday, 26-year-old Caserta and a female companion entered the water at Surfers Paradise Beach in Queensland, police said.

The woman, who has not been identified by police, was able to reach the shore, but a land, sea and air search for Caserta remains ongoing.

""Unfortunately, I had the heartbreaking job of telling Chris' parents that this is not a search and rescue for Chris. We're searching for Chris' body as the time frame for survival has passed,"" Jay Notaro, senior sergeant of Queensland Police, told reporters.

""It is an absolute tragedy at any time, but particularly just before Christmas. On behalf of the Queensland Police service, I'd like to pass on our sincere condolences to his family, friends and colleagues in the racing industry.

66,Essential Quality wins the Belmont Stakes,"(CNN) Essential Quality, trained by Brad Cox and ridden by jockey Luis Saez, won the 153rd running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York.

The horse was the early betting favorite to win the 1.5-mile race and finished ahead of Hot Rod Charlie and the 146th Preakness Stakes winner Rombauer, who finished in second and third place, respectively.

Hot Rod Charlie was the early leader but Essential Quality passed him in the final turn and held on down the stretch to win. The win gave trainer Brad Cox his first Triple Crown victory.

A limited crowd of 11,000 were allowed to attend the ""Test of the Champion"" with proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test required for entry.

Jockey Luis Saez reacts after winning the 153rd running of the Belmont Stakes atop Essential Quality on Saturday, June 5.

This year's race did not include Medina Spirit, the Kentucky Derby winner, after the horse failed a post-Derby drug test. In May, the New York Racing Association temporarily suspended Medina Spirit's trainer Bob Baffert from entering any horses in races at the track that is host to the Belmont Stakes.

67,How feeling 'vulnerable' helped climber Lor Sabourin explore their identity,"(CNN) The feeling of total vulnerability is something that would prevent most from trying rock climbing , but for Lor Sabourin, it's what they love most about the sport.

Being so far out of their comfort zone, tackling a route that requires both mental and physical fortitude, provides Sabourin with an opportunity to reflect and work through the challenges in their life.

In many ways, it's much more than just a sport for them -- it's a way of exploring identity which has helped them accept who they are.

""I think it's really hard to hide from the stress of climbing. When you go out, you're really choosing to be vulnerable,"" Sabourin tells CNN Sport

""You don't have to do that everywhere else in life.

""People are able to really find out how they do best when they're in stress and to learn better ways to respond to stress and to things like fear and insecurity.""

Sabourin has recently released a film with Patagonia that explores their life as a non-binary climber, following Sabourin as they take on one of the hardest routes of their life in the sandstone canyons of northern Arizona.

It provided Sabourin with a chance to speak about their journey and address what it means for them to be a trans climber in 2021.

In tackling some dark periods of their life -- including battles with eating disorders, self-harm and sexual assault -- the film ""They/Them"" shows how Sabourin has learned to thrive in the climbing community.

""Making the film was hard in a lot of ways because, so often when we go through something hard and then come out on the other side, we want to just pretend that that didn't happen,"" they added.

""So I really had to go back to parts of my story that maybe I didn't talk about with people in my life very often.

""And that was at first really challenging, but over time, it actually became really healing.""

Patagonia's latest documentary, ""They/Them,"" is a film about Lor Sabourin, an Arizona-based climber, guide and coach.

'All consuming'

Despite always loving the outdoor lifestyle, even when growing up in the urban area of Detroit, Sabourin was a self-confessed ""super-scared kid.""

It may seem improbable now when you see photos of them hanging off the side of a rock face, but there was a time when they were too scared to use the three-meter slide at their local swimming pool.

In truth, climbing wasn't something that came naturally, but sport always played a major role in their upbringing.

They were a strong runner throughout their education but finally fell into climbing as a way of combining competition with their love of the outdoors.

""[Climbing] is very all-consuming,"" Sabourin said. ""Running, for example, it's like your mind can go anywhere and you can still run quite quickly.

""And that's one of my favorite things about running is having a place where I can just let my mind go, and climbing isn't really that way.

""When you're climbing, you have to have 100% of your attention on what you're doing. And that's really therapeutic in its own way.""

Dealing with hate

The sport now plays a major role in their life and they balance it with their studies to become a therapist.

However, as their profile within the sport becomes more well-known, Sabourin has had to deal with online hate and microaggressions from within the community, such as people reacting angrily about using different pronouns.

In the film, they describe how they were subject to online abuse after an interview with climbing magazine ""Rock and Ice"" was published.

There are also times in normal life where Sabourin feels less safe than their non-trans friends.

""I guess that's really challenging, especially having a background of experiencing pretty extreme violence at a young age for my identity,"" they said.

""With the film, it definitely brings up that fear. I am putting myself out there in a really public way, and so it's definitely opening up to the potential for more of that to happen.

""But [...] in all of those interactions, people didn't take the time to get to know me.

""What I feel is really powerful about the film [...] is you kind of have to stay with me long enough to learn that I'm a human just like anyone else and that being trans is one aspect.

""Something that I really love about myself is my identity, but it actually is a fairly small aspect of my identity in the grand scheme of things.""

Sabourin wants to be a positive role model to others.

Becoming a role model

The process of making the film was an intimate affair, with Sabourin often being joined just by co-director and friend Blake McCord. They didn't want the film to make generalizations about the trans experience, but instead share their own unique story in a humanistic way.

Sabourin is aware that they may become the face for the wider community as a result.

At a time when trans people are facing scrutiny in both the sporting arena and in wider society, Sabourin says climbing has an opportunity to create a more inclusive framework that other sports can follow.

""I think it could be simpler than people believe,"" they said. ""They get so hung up in the political debates and the legislation.

""If we look at the value of sports to people, as humans, and the reasons that we participate and we strip it down back to that human aspect, it's a lot simpler than we think it is.""

Sabourin says the thought of being a role model feels similar to tackling climbing projects -- intimidating, but also inspiring -- and admits the thought of people looking up to them has made them become more honest in their personal life.

The American has struggled with eating disorders since they were seven or eight years old and wants to trigger conversations about how it can affect both athletes and the trans community.

Now in recovery, Sabourin has learned to adopt a healthier relationship with food and exercise and has realized the destructive ways in which they were using food to manage their transition.

They say the topic still isn't spoken about enough.

""I've tried my best to be a combination of holding myself really accountable and being really firm with myself about taking steps every day, but also give myself some levity around it and not always feel like I'm beating my head against the wall,"" Sabourin said.

""I want people to have a role model that's someone who takes care of themselves, who lives a life that they think is meaningful.

""I also personally want to be a person who has those things for myself.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/12/sport/lor-sabourin-climbing-identity-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
68,Nadhira Alharthy: Omani climber wants to 'die empty' in her quest to share knowledge,"(CNN) It was a chance encounter that would change her life forever. In 2017, Nadhira Alharthy met the first Omani man to climb Everest.

Khalid al-Siyabi had summited Everest seven years earlier. He was part of a group of pioneering Omanis who were telling their inspirational stories at an assembly hosted by the Ministry of Education, where Alharthy was working as the director of citizenship at the time.

That evening she made a pledge to replicate al-Siyabi's achievement, using his mentorship as guidance.

""His story, it touched me,"" she tells CNN Sport. ""I was inspired to do something for myself [...] to challenge myself.""

Building up her strength

Before training to climb the world's tallest mountain, Alharthy's workout routine extended to going to the gym a few times a week.

She knew she had to dramatically change gears, beginning with strengthening her muscles and improving her resistance. With al-Siyabi's help, her training schedule developed into that of a fully-fledged endurance athlete, consisting of running, hiking, rock climbing, canyoning and caving.

The physical preparation for Everest was challenging, but improving her mental stamina was even harder. ""Training the mind [...] it's harder than training our bodies,"" she says.

In the two years leading up to the climb, the only other person who knew about Alharthy's ambition was al-Siyabi. ""We kept it as a secret for a long time,"" she says.

She wasn't just building up her mental strength for Everest, but also working up the courage to tell her family: ""I was scared to tell them because I just decided to go to Everest without any experience.""

The endurance athlete says she takes advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain. She recently visited Jabal Akhdar, part of the Al Hajar mountain range in Oman.

'I was very lucky'

In 2019, two months before setting off for Nepal, Alharthy told her family about the expedition.

""They were very surprised and shocked because I never discussed it before. They refused the idea from the beginning. My mom was very stressed and worried about my safety,"" she says.

Despite their reaction, she was determined to fulfil her ambition. She arrived in Kathmandu flanked by an all-Arab, all-female team -- including Mona Shahab from Saudi Arabia, and Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar from Lebanon.

She was in constant contact with al-Siyabi until her arrival at base camp, when their line of communication started to dwindle. Her mentor had recently been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke.

""I started feeling worried about him. But I said, 'OK, he will make it, he's strong,'"" she says.

A week later Alharthy received the devastating news that al-Siyabi had passed away at the age of 46. She was in shock: ""Losing him, it was the hardest time there when I was climbing.""

In January 2021, Alharthy became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam, Nepal.

His death gave the expedition a new sense of purpose. Alharthy wasn't just climbing to fulfill her own ambition, she wanted to honor al-Siyabi's memory as well.

""He was the only person who stood with me, he helped me,"" she says.

""I decided to do it not for myself and not only my country, he would also be part of [...] the climb.""

After two months of trekking across snow capped mountains, she found herself atop Everest on May 23, exactly nine years to the day since al-Siyabi's summit. She commemorated her mentor by planting a piece of paper inscribed with his name on the crest of the mountain.

The poetry of their story isn't lost on her, acknowledging that ""the first Omani man helped me to be the first Omani woman [to summit Everest].""

She says completing her first summit alongside three other Arab women was what crowned her triumph: ""I was very lucky to have them [...] it brought us all together.""

Two years later, Alharthy's face still lights up when she revisits her memories of climbing Everest. ""It's not like when you buy something, when you try a new meal, when you go shopping,"" she says. ""It was a different type of happiness.""

Ama Dablam

While participating in endurance sports, Alharthy has had the chance to connect with fellow mountaineers.

In January, she became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam (22,349 feet) -- a mountain south of Everest -- while climbing alongside Qatari mountaineer Fahad Badar

""I was not planning to go to Ama Dablam from the beginning. Then one of our friends, Fahad [...] he messaged me that he was going,"" says Alharthy.

""I told him, I'm not as afraid of climbing the mountain as I was afraid of the cold because it's winter season and that's very difficult.""

Having unsuccessfully attempted the same climb in 2018, Alharthy was ""scared of failing again,"" but she knew that Badar's moral support, coupled with her training for Everest, would set her in good stead. ""I felt that I was prepared.""

With an exposed ridge that requires vertical mixed climbing in rock, ice and snow, she acknowledges this was her most grueling trial yet.

She says the technical know-how and full-body strength required to climb Ama Dablam surpassed Everest.

""There is no way for mistakes on Ama Dablam because it's like you are climbing a big wall. We had to be attached on safety ropes all the time,"" she adds. ""If we miss anything, it's very dangerous.""

Over the past year, Alharthy hasn't had a chance to plan ahead for expeditions due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, she's been taking advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain -- most recently visiting the country's epic Al Hoota Cave, which is over two million years old and has a total length of almost 2.8 miles.

""I want to use all the chances I have here in Oman to improve myself physically,"" she says.

Her next goal is to climb one of the 14 mountain peaks across the world that stand taller than 8,000m, dubbed by NASA as the Eight Thousanders.

Rock formations in the Al Hoota natural cave after it re-opened to the public for the first time in three years near the ancient city of Jizwa in Oman's northern Dakhiliya region on September 2016.

Finding solidarity through faith

Cementing her status as a record-breaking mountaineer means that Alharthy has attracted waves of media attention over the past few years, but she was never searching for the spotlight.

Even though she relishes the opportunity to develop her physicality and test her resilience, she says that the intense media scrutiny that comes with the job is emotionally draining.

Her limits were tested after Everest. She was having trouble dealing with the emotional comedown of completing such a monumental feat and decided to stop training for a while. ""I was feeling depressed,"" she says. ""I felt this pressure on me, it was something I was not looking for.""

Alharthy has since found solidarity through her faith.

Alharthy says she hopes her story will inspire young Omanis to participate in endurance sports.

Ahead of her expedition to Ama Dablam, she earned messages of support from her Muslim fans on social media, where she has now amassed over 16,000 followers. She sees their prayers as a form of protection. ""Our faith [...] it makes you stand up again. It gives you strength, it gives you power.""

Her increased visibility online means that her family is now more accepting of her endeavors. But like any parent, her mother continues to agonize over the safety of her daughter. ""For them, it's something very exposed, it's something very unsafe. My mom, she's waiting for me to tell her that I will never climb again,"" she says. ""They support me to do what I want, but they are worried.""

She continues to inspire confidence in other Muslim women, many of whom have been encouraged to participate in outdoor sports after reading about her story.

""When I started training, many women were reluctant to do outdoor sports, especially those who wear the hijab, but it's now becoming quite common,"" she recently told the Times

Her 32 nieces also embolden her to share her journey and highlight the power of female participation in sport. ""They are very strong, and they stand up for their rights,"" she says.

Mount Ama Dablam, which peaks at 6,812 meters (22,349 feet), in the Everest region.

'Believe in your dream'

Alharthy says the main purpose of her journey is to practice author Todd Henry's mantra -- to figuratively ""die empty"" from sharing knowledge: ""I think that's what Khalid was doing with many Omanis.""

""I think it's a great story,"" she goes on to tell CNN. ""Even for the new generation, for the other girls and men, just to support each other, to help each other, not to hold knowledge for ourselves.""

She hopes that by teaching others about her experience through her newly appointed role as the general manager's assistant for the Girl Guides of Oman, she can lift up a new generation of young Omani people to take up endurance sports.

Alharthy is also learning from her peers. She references one of her Everest teammates, Arthur Muir, who was initially unable to finish his trek in 2019. However, in May of this year, he became the oldest American to climb the world's highest peak at age 75.

""He's very positive, [a] great personality, [an] inspiration for all of us,"" she says. ""Believe in yourself, believe in your dream and work hard.""

Ultimately, she draws strength from staying committed to her faith and her Omani roots.

""I always wake up in the morning and say, 'Alhumdullilah, thank God I'm here [...] I reached my goal,"" she says.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/16/sport/nadhira-alharthy-profile-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
69,Janja Garnbret: Olympic hopeful on her Tokyo dream and hopes for climbing in the future,"As a child growing up in Slovenia, she'd regularly be found racing up trees or scaling the door frames in her house, but it was on the climbing wall where she felt most at home and where her talent eventually shone through.

Yet despite being one of the favorites to win gold at this year's Tokyo Olympics , Garnbret's career didn't get off to the start you might expect.

She came last in her category in her first competition as a child but says she loved the sport too much to care at that stage.

""People always ask me if I was ever comparing myself to other kids, I was actually not,"" Garnbret, who recently scaled Europe's tallest chimney, tells CNN Sport.

""I was just enjoying myself on the wall and I was just climbing, trying to push my limits. I never thought to myself that I am better than everyone else. I just enjoyed climbing.""

After a couple of years of practice and hard work, Garnbret quickly emerged as one of the best climbers in her country.

Her world-class ability then became evident as she entered international competitions and started winning them consistently.

She has gone on to win multiple World Cup events and has her eyes firmly on the postponed Tokyo Games which are set to finally go ahead this summer, which will see sport climbing make its Olympic debut.

Slovenia's Janja Garnbret says she's looking forward to making her Olympic debut in Tokyo.

'I learned a lot about myself'

The 22-year-old says the initial postponement gave her more time to work on her weaknesses but admitted the uncertainty around the pandemic was difficult to get her head around.

She was fortunate enough to have a climbing wall at home, which she used to keep in good shape during her country's lockdown, but she was tested in ways she hadn't expected.

""I could train, but for me, it was hard because I was always the motivated person. I always had small goals and, of course, big goals and I never had fluctuations in motivation,"" she says.

""I was always motivated but now it happened to me that I was motivated some days for training, some days not because every competition was postponed. I didn't know myself like that.

""It was just something different and I learned a lot about myself, but I got used to the situation quite quickly.""

Organizers remain insistent that the Games will go ahead this year, but there is still an element of doubt that the pandemic could scupper plans once again.

Garnbret is trying to stay positive and is optimistic she'll make her Olympic debut in 2021, despite the situation seemingly changing every week.

""I think Covid last year was just, of course, something new for us and we didn't know what to expect, how to deal with it,"" she adds.

""But we came prepared into this year with all safety precautions and everything. It's still not a hundred percent, I completely understand that, but I will do my best and I will keep preparing for the Olympics.""

Driving four hours a day

Should sport climbing make its debut at this year's Olympics, the competition will be run across three disciplines, each with their own techniques and format.

Bouldering involves navigating as many fixed routes as possible in four minutes on a four-meter high wall with no safety ropes. Lead climbing requires athletes to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter plus wall in six minutes using safety ropes, without reclimbs. Speed climbing has two climbers ascend a parallel route at the same time on a 15-meter wall set at 95 degrees -- sometimes doing so in under 8 seconds. Combined results will determine medalists.

Garnbret says speed climbing is by far her weakest discipline but has a thorough training schedule in place to improve every aspect of her performance.

She trains six days a week, splitting her time between gym work, speed climbing and her usual wall training. Due to a lack of centralized facilities in Slovenia, Garnbret often drives up to four hours a day to attend all her sessions.

It's a regime that requires determination, passion and a tireless work ethic but winning a gold medal would make it all worthwhile.

""I definitely know that every girl will take that extra year to their benefit,"" she says. ""I know every girl has her eyes set on the gold.""

""I can't say that I will win the gold because I know everyone will be 100% prepared for that.

""I will definitely keep training and I will be prepared as much as possible when the time comes and then we will see what will happen. But, definitely, I'm looking forward to it.""

Garnbret says the global pandemic initally knocked her motivation.

Promoting healthy climbing

While other athletes will be backed by wealthy sponsors and a team of sport scientists at this year's Olympics, Garnbret knows climbing is not quite at that level.

The Slovenian hopes the opportunity to compete in front of a global audience will go some way towards changing that.

""I think it will be really beneficial to climbing because climbing is still a young sport. It's super young,"" she says.

""So it's definitely a huge playground for everyone, for sponsors, for some non-endemic sponsors that are still yet to come into our sport. That's definitely something huge.""

Due to her success, Garnbret is already a role model to young climbers across the world, and she hopes she can drive the charge for better facilities in her own country.

She also wants to boost a healthy image of the sport, which she says is more important than anything.

Garnbret says the demands of climbing have led to youngsters, especially girls, trying to get lighter. This has, she says, sometimes led to people developing eating disorders in the bid for better results.

She now wants to use her platform to show the next generation of climbers that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can translate into success.

""I just want to set a good example in that you don't need to lose extra weight to be successful,"" she says.

""I definitely feel responsible for our sport. I just want to represent climbing as a fun sport, that it's always fun, you have to just climb up and enjoy yourself.""

She continues: ""I remember I fell in love [...] the first time that I tried climbing because it felt so weightless, and it was just me and the wall. I remember that I was the only kid who stayed on the wall and didn't want to come off.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/03/sport/janja-garnbret-climbing-olympics-tokyo-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
70,Victoria Evans breaks the world record for fastest female solo row across the Atlantic Ocean,"(CNN) With nothing but her small boat for company, British lawyer Victoria Evans battled high winds, big waves and sleep deprivation to record the fastest female solo row across the Atlantic Ocean .

After setting off from Tenerife, Spain, on February 11, the 35-year-old covered 4,740 kilometers in 40 days and 19 hours before finally reaching land in Barbados.

Despite experiencing extreme conditions and encountering multiple problems along the way, Evans broke the previous world record by over eight days.

""It was much harder than I expected,"" she told CNN Sport. ""Not physically, but in terms of the conditions.

""I got probably the strongest kind of wind you can get out on the Atlantic for a very prolonged period and the resilience you need to keep going through that was huge.""

Evans had spent four years preparing for this journey of a lifetime but nothing could have readied her for the reality of an ocean crossing.

Even before setting off, the trip was plagued by issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic which forced the challenge to be postponed by a year.

Then there was the logistical nightmare of getting the boat, and herself, across borders to reach the start point in Spain, with Evans requiring additional government support to do so.

Once the challenge was underway, high winds made rowing -- and sleeping -- incredibly difficult, while issues with steering equipment caused Evans to drift off track at times.

At one point she was even stuck outside of her cabin after a wave locked the door from the inside. It took her three hours to saw through the lock with a blade.

There were the inevitable blisters and occasional sunburn, though by the sound of it Evans seems to thrive in extreme conditions.

""It's a very unique sport in that you can't get off when you're there and you have to deal with it. So it was so, so intense,"" said Evans, who was inspired to tackle crossing the Atlantic after climbing Mont Blanc in 2017.

Evans broke the record for the fastest solo female crossing of the Atlantic Ocean.

'We are so capable of training our brains'

""I think I really enjoy adventure sport due to the psychological elements of it and how much it forces you to learn about yourself and face up to yourself and the limits of where you can push yourself to,"" added Evans.

""We are so capable of training our brains to allow us to achieve more but often people don't want to put that work in.""

Evans lost just 4 kilograms on the journey, something she credits to her physical preparation and her simple yet nutritious diet while on board -- using food as a pick-me-up whenever she felt overwhelmed.

Music became very important to Evans during the crossing. After all, no one can hear you sing when you're thousands of miles from land.

David Bowie, Elton John and Sam Fender's new album provided some of the hundreds of hours of music blared out amid the waves, offering unwavering motivation and a bit of company while Evans plugged away in total isolation.

Isolation, that is, minus the ""special"" wildlife she got the honor of seeing along the way.

Turtles, sharks and numerous fish offered light relief to the mammoth slog and Evans would take time to stop rowing whenever something popped its head out of the water.

She even saw a super pod of dolphins as she celebrated her 35th birthday .

""It was like they'd heard there was a party. I've never seen anything like it. Everywhere you look, there were dolphins,"" she said.

Despite admitting she doesn't miss the stress of life on the ocean, Evans knows it was an experience she will never get again, smiling as she recalls the times she would cover up her navigation lights and stare up to the unspoilt night sky, getting lost in the stars above.

""You're never going to be there again and it's easy to lose sight of that when you're chasing the record, because you're trying to go as quickly as possible, she said.

Advocating for women in sport

Admitting she wasn't particularly sporty as a child, Evans says her 15-year-old self would never have believed she was capable of setting such a record.

While the challenge was a personal goal for Evans, she also completed it to raise awareness and money for UK charity Women In Sport which looks to ""give every woman and girl the opportunity to take part in sport.""

Evans has raised over £24,000 ($31,526) already for the charity and, through her legal work, she wants to advocate for more change now she's back on dry land.

""Women are so capable in sport,"" she said. ""It is massively improving, but there seems to still be an underestimation of women.

""I'd want the message to be for everyone, but particularly women and girls, to know that they're capable of absolutely anything they set their mind to.

""And on a wider level for sport as an industry to show that change needs to come and it's an outdated viewpoint to assume that we need a helping hand or smaller events.""

Before getting to work, Evans was enjoying life in Barbados.

Joined by her family and friends, she spent her first night on dry land watching the sun set over the ocean she just conquered.

But make no mistake, she has no plans to get back in a boat anytime soon.

""I never felt that I was in immediate, serious risk but I was very much aware that one change could put me into a life threatening situation,"" she said.

""I'm not going to miss the stress of that.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/sport/victoria-evans-atlantic-ocean-row-record-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
71,Zach Bates: Ultramarathoner with autism inspiring others after crushing 100 mile goal,"(CNN) With an injured hip, blisters on his feet and experiencing the sort of exhaustion few would be familiar with, Zach Bates retained a steely focus and determination.

Fighting through pain after running for 28 hours, and amid the sound of tired feet struggling through the Arizona dirt -- finally soft, soothing music grew over the horizon.

The sights and sounds of cheering family, coaches, and supporters grew closer and louder with every step. The finish line, which was once 100 miles away, was right in front of him.

A small, roaring human victory tunnel welcomed Bates as he ran across the finish line and cemented himself as an ultramarathon runner.

""I saw the finish line and people made a tunnel with their arms for me to run through. I also saw my cousins with their signs. Just really exciting,"" Bates tells CNN, reflecting on his accomplishment.

Diagnosed with autism at the age of four, the 20-year-old American completed the Coldwater Rumble 100 mile Ultramarathon earlier this year, becoming the youngest finisher in the race's history, aged 19.

Completing the 20-mile loop five times across a rugged terrain is an accomplishment itself but Bates finished 38th overall out of the 99 starters in just over 28 hours - and it is worth noting that 33 runners didn't finish.

The achievement makes Bates seem like a seasoned ultra-runner but he and his family are just beginning their journey into the ultramarathon world.

Bates hopes to inspire others with autism to take up running.

'it seemed different'

Bates was a member of the cross-country team in high school but, after graduating in May 2021 he surprised his family with a new goal.

""Graduation night, he comes to us and says, 'hey, I want to run a 100-mile race before my 20th birthday' which was about eight months from that date. And I was like, oh, that's a lot,"" his mother, Rana, tells CNN World Sport's Patrick Snell.

Of his decision to run 100 miles, Bates says: ""I've seen people's journeys and then I thought they were really cool and interesting, and it seemed different than other races. I wanted to try to do that.""

Neither he nor his parents had any prior experience of preparing for the task at hand, but Rand and Brian, his father, found ways to help, truly making it a family affair.

""We search out trails for him to do. We'll go ahead of time as a family and hike a trail to make sure it's safe,"" says Rana.

In addition to finding trails, they read books together, organize all his nutrition, and make sure their son has the right equipment - like the watch he wears on long runs so they can track him and make sure he's safe and on course.

Rana and Brian even helped with training schedules before finding more experienced ultramarathon runners -- such as mentor John Hendrix and coach Nickademus de la Rosa.

With Hendrix and De la Rosa's expertise, the young American prepared by competing in shorter distances and successfully worked his way up to the 100-miler in short time.

One of Bates' goals was to run a 100-mile race before he turned 20.

Staying focused

Rather than having his autism be a reason to make the goal unreachable, his mum explained how it might have helped him stay focused.

""With autism, there is this hyper focus and when they have this focus on something that they love and they desire to do, it takes them so much further than maybe what I can accomplish,"" she explains.

""It's really important that they are treated as an individual. That we can look at them and hear what their dreams are, what their hopes are for their life.

""If we listen to our children and allow them to do what they want to do and be a support to them, you'll be so surprised at where they'll end up.""

For Bates, he's achieved goals and distances that were once just dreams. As he continues to train for more challenges, he's turned to social media to help capture his journey along the way. In doing so, he has been embraced by runners from all over, but Rana says that's not the only way social media has helped.

Bates' achievements have been lauded on social media by runners around the world.

""It has helped Zach realize that what he's doing is special and that what he's doing is inspiring people and that's what helps Zack want to continue to participate in the social media because he feels like it's worth it to go out of his way to do something uncomfortable for himself, which the social media is a little bit uncomfortable for him, if it's going to help somebody else do something hard and reach their dreams.""

""I've had dreams my entire life, things that I've wanted to do. This journey has kind of given me the courage to go forward and do some of the things that I've been really excited about and given me the courage to take some initial steps,"" adds Rana.

""Having him in our family is just a light and I'm just inspired by the light that he is to everybody that he's around.""

Earlier this year, Zach Bates became the youngest ever finisher of the Coldwater Rumble 100 mile Ultramarathon.

He's already scheduled multiple races of various distances this year, but when asked about his next big ambition, Bates has his sights set on loftier goals.

""I have seen the Cocodona 250. It's like a 250 mile race I've thought about before. It might be a little while before I try doing that race. It's not just 250 miles, but also has [close to] 50,000 feet of elevation!""

With the support of Rana, Brian and the rest of the family, it feels as though nothing is impossible when it comes to Zach Bates. No matter where the next trail in life takes him.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/02/sport/zach-bates-ultramarathon-autism-spt-intl/index.html
72,Molly Seidel: How distance runner overcame 'imposter syndrome' and 'blew away' her expectations in the marathon,"(CNN) Mastering the art of marathon running is a lifetime pursuit for some, but it seemed to take Molly Seidel roughly two-and-a-half hours on one windswept morning in Atlanta a couple of years ago.

That was during the US Olympic trials when Seidel, competing in her first ever marathon, stunned the field to place second and qualify for the US team.

Fast-forward to 2022 and, three marathons later, the 27-year-old Seidel can now call herself an Olympic medalist and the fastest American woman ever at the New York City Marathon.

Having taken to the start line of her debut marathon in Atlanta hoping to place in the top 20 -- with the prospect of competing, let alone medaling, at the Olympics a remote thought -- she's the first to admit the race ""blew away all of my expectations.""

""Life has a funny way of giving you what you need before you think you're ready for it,"" Seidel tells CNN Sport , weeks out from the fifth marathon of her career in Boston next month.

While many distance runners step up to the 26.2-mile marathon distance towards the end of their careers, Seidel was a comparatively early convert having made the switch from track racing in her mid 20s.

Partly, that was due to her frustration with running 10,000m on the track -- ""I kind of kept banging my head against the wall with that one,"" she says -- and partly due to ambitions she had held growing up.

""I always kind of dreamed of doing the marathon,"" Seidel adds.

""I think there's just this kind of like glamor and mystery around it, and especially for a younger runner who enjoys doing the distance events in high school, that's kind of the ultimate goal. Everybody wants to do the marathon.""

An emotional Seidel reacts to finishing second at the Olympic trials.

Seidel's success at the Olympic trials wasn't without challenges. As the pandemic delayed the Tokyo Games by a year, further opportunities to prove her credentials in the marathon distance were placed on hold.

""I struggled with this kind of imposter syndrome after the trials, specifically as probably the person no one expected to make the team and the person that got probably the most criticism like: Hey, why is this girl on the team?"" she says.

""I think I really struggled with that, and I struggled going into the Games and feeling like I belonged there and trying to prove that I wasn't a mistake on that team.""

The postponement of the Olympics did give Seidel the chance to compete in a second marathon -- a sixth-place finish on a modified, elites-only London course involving 20 laps around Buckingham Palace -- before gradually turning her attention to the Games.

When the Olympic Marathon came around 18 months after she had qualified for the team, Seidel once again exceeded her own expectations with a typically gutsy, gritty performance in the sweltering heat of Sapporo.

As leaders Peres Jepchirchir and Brigid Kosgei of Kenya pulled away in the closing stages of the race, Seidel found herself vying for a medal alongside Israel's Lonah Chamtai Salpeter.

But with two-and-a-half miles remaining, Salpeter hit a wall and faded from contention.

A medal was now Seidel's to lose, and she duly wrapped up the bronze with a scream of joy as she crossed the finish line -- the third US woman ever to medal in the Olympic marathon.

""I struggle with confidence and I struggle with wondering whether or not I belong at this level, whether I belong as a competitor on the world stage,"" says Seidel.

""The Olympic medal was kind of showing me: Hey, you belong here, and you can do this regardless of any insecurities that you might feel,"" she adds. ""You can still go get beaten, you can still have a lot of work to do, but you can do this.""

That run at the Olympics -- brutal and energy-sapping in itself -- was made all the more draining because of the circumstances around the Games.

""Yes, we were coming off this emotional high winning the medal,"" says Seidel, ""but there had been so much just pent up stress over the course of the Games and leading into the Games with Covid, with the quarantine, wondering if the Games are going to happen.

JUST WATCHED She missed out on the Olympics, so she broke 50km record instead Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH She missed out on the Olympics, so she broke 50km record instead 02:29

""And so I came back and frankly, I was just tired and emotionally exhausted and spent.""

After returning to her family in Wisconsin -- ""a detox from the amount of stress that I'd been holding throughout the entirety of the Games,"" according to Seidel -- she started her buildup to her fourth marathon in November, this time in New York

But obstacles -- physical as well as mental -- kept appearing. Two broken ribs she suffered ahead of the race hadn't healed with race day looming, and her coach Jon Green suggested she wasn't ready to compete.

""It was an absolute disaster of a buildup,"" says Seidel.

""It was really hard, not only with the mental stress that we had going on after the Games of just feeling, frankly, no motivation. And just trying to find that drive to re-up for another hard race right after an enormous race that I'd been training effectively two years for.

""And then it was just like problem after problem after problem, and injury after injury.""

Seidel catches her breath at the end of the Olympic marathon in Sapporo.

Even with two of her ribs broken, Seidel says she ""felt incredible"" during the race, setting a new course record for an American woman of two hours, 24 minutes and 42 seconds and placing fourth.

She had planned to make a return to the streets of New York this weekend for the NYC Half, but announced on Tuesday that ""setbacks in training"" -- which are not infrequent occurrences when you're running up to 135 miles a week -- have meant she took the decision to stay at her training base in Flagstaff, Arizona ahead of the Boston Marathon.

""It's super tough,"" Seidel said on her high-mileage schedule.

""It's hard, but I think it's a matter of learning how to balance. Your body adapts over time and I make sure I'm getting sufficient rest and all that. It's a challenge, but I love the challenge of it.""

Seidel is no stranger to training setbacks and has previously explained how her ""very high pain tolerance"" has caused her to push beyond discomfort and exacerbate injuries. In her first year as a pro runner from 2017 to 2018, for example, she ran on a broken pelvis for a year.

A lot has changed in her running career since then. Broken bones have healed and Seidel has established herself as one of the best marathon runners in the world. But that's not to say there are no more goals to chase, nor that there are no more lessons to learn.

Each marathon, she explains, brings with it fresh experience and a renewed sense of joy.

""I feel like every single time it's just kind of wild,"" says Seidel.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/sport/molly-seidel-marathon-distance-running-spt-intl-cmd/index.html
73,Bodybuilder Rene Campbell wants to change the view of what women should look like,"(CNN) Counterpointed by a number of striking tattoos, hers is a body defined by muscle. She is a mother of two who embodies power and strength.

Rene Campbell has dedicated most of her life to sculpting her once diminutive frame into one that, she says, goes ""completely against what society thinks a woman should look like.""

The bodybuilder's dedication has brought plenty of awards but building her dream body -- gaining over 85 pounds, going from a UK size 8 to 14 -- has had its challenges, too, both physically and mentally.

""I was very insecure about my body image, very insecure about myself as a person,"" Campbell, 44, tells CNN Sport from her home in Cornwall, UK, as she reflects on her motivation to transform herself.

""I was constantly feeling under pressure through the media that women needed to look a certain way.""

""My bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself,"" says Rene Campbell.

'A woman with muscle'

""For quite some time I struggled with eating disorders because I was constantly trying to keep my weight really low, to appear skinny, like these women are on magazine covers,"" she says.

Then, she attended a women's bodybuilding show and became intrigued by the way these seemingly confident women held themselves.

Though Campbell ​says she loves the way she now looks, ​she says she is sometimes treated with cruelty, like when she has been asked to leave women's toilets.

""A lot of the time you are up against a lot of negativity. People set in an old mindset,"" Campbell adds.

""I was up against -- and still am -- a lot of criticism from people who don't understand why women would want to be muscular. But it just gave me a sense of confidence and mental strength.

""I'm stuck in a situation where I have to prove that I'm a woman in order to use these toilets? It's quite offensive. I do try and explain to them quite nicely. I may look this way but, at the end of the day, I am a woman. I have every right to use these toilets.""

""There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession,"" says Campbell.

Studying female bodybuilders

For over a decade, sociologist Dr. Tanya Bunsell has been researching female bodybuilders.

""When I would tell people that I was studying female bodybuilders, the first reaction was, 'That's just not attractive,'"" Dr. Bunsell, a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science at Canterbury Christ Church University, tells CNN Sport.

""There's definitely a glass ceiling on muscularity, and that crossover boundary where the body becomes transgressive and interrogates people's notions of male and female.

""The troublesome and disturbing body of the hyper-muscular woman is deemed so outrageously deviant by society that it provokes harsh comments.""

""Even though there is a huge market encouraging women to build abs and tighten their figures, the ideal still stands for smaller waists, curvy hips and lean legs, the so-called hourglass figure,"" adds Dr. Bunsell.

Campbell takes enormous pride in the way she has reshaped her body.

'The body becomes an amazing machine'

When she started her bodybuilding career, ​Campbell says eating copious amounts of food was, at first, a shock to the body and mind.

""My body temperature went up,"" she says, ​saying that putting on weight initially scared her.

""I was feeling hot all the time because you're constantly eating, but once you get over that stage the body becomes an amazing machine and it starts to take that fuel in.""

""There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession,"" says Campbell.

""You look at any athlete that has achieved great things, there has to be a certain level of obsession.""

A photograph of Campbell is currently featured in a six-month exhibition in west London called ""Womanhood.""

Max Ellis, the photographer who took the portait of Campbell, describes his subject as a ""work of art.""

""She's worked her whole life to try and achieve this,"" Ellis ​said. ""If you're a woman and you're doing this [bodybuilding], you are swimming upstream. You're fighting every known convention.""

Steroids

But bodybuilding has a dark side, a long association with steroid use to help build muscle.

""Before she went to the world championships, Rene had to do a drug test and passed the drug test, but a lot of these girls didn't pass,"" Wanda Tierney, chairperson of IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) Women's Committee , tells CNN Sport.

Campbell says it would be naïve to think that the problem does not exist, but argues that steroids abuse happens in other sports and in society, too.

""The onus is on the athletes to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their federation,"" Campbell says. ""My federation (The IFBB), is a signatory to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code, and the IFBB anti-doping rules are in full compliance with the 2015 WADA code.""

And as she reflected on her body's evolution, Campbell was keen to stress how bodybuilding had been accompanied by a shift in her mental health.

""It was a very big shift for me mentally, because my bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/sport/rene-campbell-bodybuilding-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
74,Olympic high jumper pressured to 'perform better' and lose a few pounds,"(CNN) The rejection was brutal. At the age of 16, Priscilla Frederick-Loomis attended a model agency casting session in New York City where she was told that she was ""too heavy.""

Even now at the age of 31, those two words still play on the Olympic high jumper's mind. Raised by a single mother in New Jersey, Loomis also toyed with the idea of becoming an actor and that's a dream she hasn't given up on as she has pursued her athletics career.

""I'm going to use track and field as a way to make a name for myself,"" Loomis, who is a two-time Pan American Games silver medalist and competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, tells CNN Sport from her home in the US. She represented Antigua and Barbuda, where her father is from.

Pursuing a career in track and field hasn't been easy.

""When you are trying to be an elite athlete, on top of trying to get signed on, on top of dealing with coaches, you also have, the pressures, one for me, of being an African-American female representing a Caribbean island. And you're adding on top of all that body shaming.""

Loomis competes in the women's high jump final at the Pan American Games in August 2019 in Lima, Peru.

'Don't eat ... jump better'

If the modelling industry left Loomis scarred and dissatisfied with her shape, then perceptions of her weight have also impacted her sporting ambitions.

Even though she never thought she had an eating disorder, Loomis remembers a conversation she had with her college nutritionist, asking: ""'How can I be anorexic and be an athlete?'""

""When I said to my nutritionist that I want to be anorexic, never did I mean I want to have an eating disorder. The power of the word wasn't apparent to me.

""Now, I look back like and think, 'What the hell was wrong with me? I didn't even realize a lot of female athletes have eating disorders.""

But at that point in her career, that's what Loomis felt she had to do to be successful given she was 158 lbs and is 5 ft 10 tall, which she noted is six inches shorter and at least 20 pounds more than her rivals.

""In my head, it was common sense: don't eat a lot, look better, jump better,"" said Loomis, who remembers a time at college when her then coach Richard Fisher advised her to grab something to eat after a training session.

""I wanted an ice cream, a little ice cream,"" she says as she demonstrated how small the size was.

Except another coach told Loomis to put the ice cream down.

""In my head, that stuck with me for so long because I was like, 'I'm making bad decisions. I'm fat,'"" says Loomis.

Loomis competes in the high jump final at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

'One in a billion'

According to US-based eating disorder expert Dr. Gayle Brooks our culture emphasizes and overvalues thinness as the health and beauty ideal.

""When this cultural value system is combined with the pressures of athletic competition, which places an emphasis on diet, appearance, size and weight to achieve peak performance, it places some athletes at high risk of developing disordered eating and possibly eating disorders,"" Dr. Brooks told CNN Sport.

Dr. Brooks is the vice president and chief clinical officer for the Renfrew Center, a US-based clinic specializing in eating disorders treatments. Over Brooks' 30 year career, she has treated many patients who suffer from eating disorders and acted as the eating disorders specialist in the HBO film Thin.

According to a US study -- Prevalence of Eating disorders among Blacks in the National Survey of American Life -- anorexia was the rarest eating disorder among African American adults and adolescents, while binge eating was the most prevalent eating disorder among adults and adolescents.

""We are really understanding more and more that eating disorders are not just a White, suburban women's disease, and that, you know, for a long time the belief was that women of color, particularly Black women, were protected culturally from developing eating disorders,"" said Dr. Brooks.

As she trained for her first Olympic appearance in 2016, Loomis adhered to a strict diet.

""I would eat super healthy and super clean, be on it for a month. One time I was just like, 'I really would love a donut, or I really would love a cupcake' and I have a sweet tooth.""

However, according to then-coach Richard Fisher, Loomis wasn't eating enough.

""We started working together, she was eating maybe three meals a day tops. Everything was low and minimum.

""She would be so hungry, she would eat unhealthy things as anyone, and her lack of nutrition was hindering her from performing the correct way that she needed to.""

The track and field coach adds: ""A lot of coaches look at, I would say the average high jumper who's professional and look at their height and their weight ratio.

""They use that as the standard for what they believe an athlete should be, which in reality is not true all the time. Yes, it might be the perfect standard of what you want. But a lot of these athletes, you have to realize, are one a billion.

""Priscilla always used to say to me, 'I'm the shortest, fattest high jumper out there.'""

Once she's finished competing Loomis wants to pursue an acting career.

'Loving myself'

According to World Athletics, in a statement sent to CNN: ""There is no one kind of body measurement requirement to qualify for the Olympics. That is not the case. There is no such requirement. The qualifying standards are all based around performance.""

Last year World Athletics released a Nutrition Consensus Statement providing the latest research and guidance around nutrition to athletes, coaches and administrators.

In a statement sent to CNN Sport, the International Olympic Committee also said it ""stands for non-discrimination as one of the founding pillars of the Olympic Movement, which is reflected in the Olympic Charter, Fundamental Principle 6.

""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

""Furthermore, athletes' safety and wellbeing is a priority and a core value for the IOC, which is committed to leading and supporting the Olympic Movement in the implementation of safeguarding measures, in line with its mission stated in the Olympic Charter to promote safe sport and the protection of athletes from all forms of harassment and abuse.""

Even Loomis' teammates were all too quick to chime in with disparaging comments about her appearance.

After Loomis' appearance at the 2015 Outdoor World Championships in Beijing, she says she was called ""thick"" and ""heavy"" by her teammates from Antigua and Barbuda. And that was after she had just competed on the track.

The Antiguan and Barbuda Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment.

Three years later she placed fifth in the high jump at the Commonwealth Games in Australia. She went to the bar to grab a beer to celebrate when a man, who recognized Loomis from her famous purple hair, came up to her and said, ""Oh, I saw you on TV. If you would drop a few kilos, you would have performed better.""

As a result of those comments, Loomis says she would drink a pot of coffee to dehydrate herself to appear slim on screen.

Loomis is currently working with a female coach, Lauren Biscardi, a former New York state champion in high jump, who the 31-year-old athlete says has ""changed my professional career. She has helped me love training, love myself and has allowed me to feel.""

Loomis competed at Rio in 2016 and has ambitions to compete at the Tokyo Olympics and at Beijing 2022.

Cleaning business

Growing up, the African American athlete says she did not see anyone she could relate to in the advertising industry. She says she wanted to be ""light skinned,"" but as she has discovered the idea of self-love, Loomis realized that she does not want other women ""to wish they had to be different to be pretty.""

""I do think that the color of my skin and my beautiful chocolate skin color are sometimes deemed as negative and not marketable,"" added Loomis.

""Viola Davis said it best, 'If you're darker than a paper bag, you're deemed not sexy.'

Off the track, Loomis has had to be creative in finding ways to fund her sporting career.

""I make $12,000 a year,"" she says, referring to her sporting income. ""When people hear that, they're like, 'There's no way,'"" she says, ""I'm like, 'Yes I have an Olympic solidarity with Antigua and it's $1,000 a month but that has to cover everything, which it doesn't.""

For her Olympic appearance in 2016, she had to move in with her coach Fisher and start her cleaning business.

Now, she lives with her husband Kenneth Loomis, a high school teacher and coach, but she still oversees the cleaning business.

""It gets exhausting. It gets tiresome. I clean just about three to four times a week. All of my clients are about an hour to an hour and a half away. So, with that, I have to start by 8 a.m. I'll clean for four hours.""

""My pain is valid, my perception is valid, and my success is valid,"" says Loomis.

She trains two to three hours after she's done cleaning.

""As much as most people think that I'm making all this money, I'm just, you know, faking it till I make it,"" says Loomis, who is now training to take part at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Her goal is to become a three-time Olympian and if she makes it to Beijing -- Loomis plans to compete in the monobob, the one-person bobsled event.

Of those acting ambitions when she finally leaves track and field behind, Loomis says she wants to start attending acting classes, adding that Storm, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman are the three superheroes that she dreams of playing.

""I want to entertain people. I want to entertain large crowds. I want to make them feel things the same way that I feel from movies and get these emotions.

""Right now, at 31, I look back and realize that my story is incredible. My pain is valid, my perception is valid, and my success is valid. I'm not just another strong Black woman, I'm a powerful voice that won't allow other opinions to weigh her down or belittle herself. That's what makes me a winning athlete.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/sport/priscilla-frederick-loomis-olympics-spt-intl/index.html
75,Women sport stars' fight for body acceptance,"(CNN) She was comfortable with her body, though others were not.

Track and field star Marilyn Okoro, whose right arm displays a ""Saved by Grace"" tattoo, ran with pride for Great Britain.

""I was told that I was too big to be an 800-meter runner, too short to be an 800m runner,"" Okoro, an Olympic bronze medalist and World Championships silver medalist, tells CNN Sport.

GB was originally placed fifth at the 2008 Beijing Games but in 2016, third-placed Russia and fourth-placed Belarus were disqualified by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) due to doping violations, raising Okoro and her team to third place.

Okoro was awarded her 4x400m relay Olympic bronze medal at the Anniversary Games at the London Stadium in 2018.

Over the last decade, she's also competed in a variety of European and World Championships, collecting a total of three silvers and four more bronze.

'I can see your veins'

But as she looks back at her career, Okoro reflects perhaps bronze and silver were not quite good enough. Come to think of it, perhaps even a gold medal wouldn't have been good enough.

She also wants to start a wider conversation about the issues surrounding women and body acceptance.

Okoro says she started to feel that she wasn't just having to compete on the track. She was having to compete with people's expectations and demands as to what an athlete should look like.

According to Okoro, that look was skinny, slender and tall.

""Oh, I can see your veins, this must mean you're in good shape,"" Okoro recalls a conversation she had with coach Charles van Commenee, who worked with the British Athletics team for a number of years, during the prep camp leading into the 2010 European Championships.

Okoro says that Van Commenee then asked her about her weight.

""Proudly, I was like '60 kilograms,'"" replied Okoro, who considers that her personal ideal race weight.

Okoro says that is 15kg heavier than the other athletes she raced against, placing her above traditional weight threshold norms in track and field.

According to Okoro, Van Commenee then responded: ""Oh, you must be heavy boned!""

Van Commenee, who now works as a motivational speaker on ""high performance culture,"" told CNN Sport: ""Being too light or being too heavy can cause injuries and therefore the staff, led by the head coach, has a duty to address this issue.

""It would be unprofessional to turn a blind eye but obviously the right words and the right tone have to be used in addressing the issue,"" he added.

Okoro competes in the 800 metres event of the Norwich Union 2006 International Athletics competition at the Alexander stadium, in Birmingham, 20 August 2006. Okoro came fourth with a time of 2.03.08 minutes.

After the championships, Okoro says she began working with a nutritionist and was advised to go on a zero-carb diet.

""I just thought, 'Okay, you've just taken out all my carbs, so I'm going to have no energy' ... You start to doubt yourself.""

Speaking specifically about Okoro, Van Commenee said he doesn't want to have a public debate with the track and field athlete. He continued: ""If she has a problem with anything I may or may not have said, I expect her to speak with me, which she has not done.""

However, Van Commenee recalled one conversation with his former athlete where he described Okoro ""ranting about her non-selection for the 800m"" at the 2012 London Olympics adding: ""It was a very painful experience for her.""

Okoro remembers the conversation differently.

""In 2012, Charles and I had an exchange regarding selections, well, he was just shouting at me in the training facility which embarrassed me.""

The 35-year-old Okoro added: ""It was two days before the British trials and the press got a hold of it as it potentially affected my (poor) performance at the championships and ran with the story.""

Okoro emphasized that it wasn't to do with her weight on this occasion.

""It was more to do with him having to have his way and throw his dominance around,"" she said.

Britain's Lee Mcconnell, Christine Ohuruogu, Nicola Sanders and Okoro celebrate on the podium after the women's 4x400m relay final, 02 September 2007, at the 11th IAAF World Athletics Championships, in Osaka. USA won ahead of Jamaica and Britian.

'Athletics is a complicated sport'

In the same year, Okoro lost her British Athletics funding under the UK Lottery program.

British Athletics told CNN that they wouldn't comment on any individual decisions, but that funding allocations are made for ""performance reasons.""

The criteria that determines the performance and funding decisions are published each year by the organization.

UK Athletics (UKA) 2020 World Class Programme Policy states: ""We have to be realistic -- athletics is a complicated sport with many varied disciplines, so one size can't fit all.""

Another section highlights that athletes have to meet individual performance thresholds and demonstrate ""ongoing global medal potential"" to receive funding.

UKA follows a 'What it Takes to Win' data and analysis framework to assess an athlete's medal winning capacity.

The framework talks of ""key physical and technical characteristics of medal winning athletes,"" which will be part of the athlete's review process taken in person with their coach.

Charles Van Commenee, Marilyn Okoro and Greg Rutherford of Great Britain speak ahead of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 5, 2009 in Torino, Italy.

According to leading sports scientist Simon Brundish, these characteristics are created through historic performance data.

""There are real genetic advantages and genetic barriers to be an elite sprinter or an elite endurance runner,"" Brundish, who's been working in international sports for 22 years, tells CNN Sport.

""Van Commenee was probably right in that Okoro was above the threshold markers, but the problem is that those markers were wrong.""

""'The data will be based against historic norms. BMI, maybe even skin folds. Which is fine for say tennis, in the 80s, where all women look the same. Then Serena appears. Suddenly the 'demands of the game' change.

""She introduces a power and speed element that didn't exist before. The price of said power is muscle. Muscle increases weight. A similar thing happened with 800m and into all middle-distance events over the last 10 years or so

""The shape of women in particular has changed because the demands changed. Power and speed in the final 200m increased so the need for greater muscle mass increased.""

Okoro looks on after the Women's 800m on day one during the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games -- IAAF Diamond League 2013 at The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on July 26, 2013 in London.

'No exit support'

The loss of funding hit Okoro hard, she says.

""I was cut from funding very abruptly with no exit support or care for my welfare afterward, which is all too common for many athletes in the UK.

""This, as with so many international athletes, was the start of many psychological and physical hurdles I had to face,"" adds Okoro, who has self-funded her career ever since.

It is not uncommon for women to be self-funded during their sports career. Tulshi Varsani, an accredited strength and conditioning coach, tells CNN Sport: ""Women must pay to play.""

Okoro and Mariya Savinova of Russia compete in the Womens 800m Final during day three of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 8, 2009 in Torino, Italy.

""Physically, I look different ...""

Okoro moved to the US before returning to the UK in 2017. Since then, she has been living in Wigan in the north of England, over 200 miles away from her hometown, London.

Okoro is proud of her Nigerian heritage and looking back she says her family background helped her deal with what she saw was unnecessary attention over her body shape.

""Physically, I look different and a lot more robust and muscular than a lot of the girls that I raced. My Nigerian background... that was something I had to hold my ground on,"" she says passionately.

""It plays a huge part in my achievements and striving for success.""

If she feels strongly about recognizing her Nigerian heritage, Okoro is equally passionate about taking pride in her body shape.

""We're expressing ourselves; you know, muscles hold strong and sexy campaigns.""

According to Okoro, over the course of her career while working with different coaches, some believed she spent too much time at the gym, but the reality is she mostly trains outdoors.

""I was different to what coaches in the UK perceived to be the image and shape for an 800m runner,"" Okoro said.

""These assumptions were there long before Charles [Van Commenee].""

Okoro says that her coaches focused on sprint training and not enough on endurance.

It was only when she started to have injuries that Okoro began to question the way she was being coached.

""Does this coach really understand? And are they really in it for me?"" she reflects. ""I was exhausted mentally and physically.

""It's been a real struggle to prove myself as one of the best 800m runners we've had in this country and even in the world.""

Okoro, Jenny Meadows of England and Eunice Jepkoech Sum of Kenya compete in the Women's 800m semifinal at Hampden Park during day eight of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games on July 31, 2014 in Glasgow.

The 'ideal' athlete

These days all different shapes and sizes are celebrated in lifestyle magazines, red carpets, beauty advertisements and fashion brands

But is that the case with sport?

""They are women first, athletes second,"" Dr. Emily Matheson, a research fellow at the Centre for Appearance Research, told CNN Sport.

Dr. Matheson says more attention is given to the shape of their bodies rather than their performances and that the 'ideal' athlete is a term to describe a sleek body with minimal body fat, which is inspired by a more general Westernized view that thinness equals beauty.

""It's very common for body shaming to eventuate from gender stereotyping. More specifically, what it means to be feminine and masculine and how female athletes' bodies may defy this stereotype and in turn be ridiculed for it.""

She points out that there have been small shifts in society, such as the body positivity movement, which was originally founded by black women, who celebrated their body types and reclaimed traditionally negative terms such as ""fat.""

Yet Dr. Matheson also argues that the body positivity movement has been ""whitewashed, with many campaigns dismissing the origins of the movement.""

GB's women's 4x400m relay team celebrate receiving their reallocated bronze medals, from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games during Day One of the Muller Anniversary Games at the London Stadium on July 21, 2018 in London, England.

Real models

Okoro is hoping to round off her 20-year career with a gold medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics -- but just as importantly fight body image expectations.

""You've got one body, and it was doing pretty great for me, so I needed to look after it,"" said Okoro, who has drawn inspiration from Serena Williams.

As Brundish references, Williams has been a key point in the conversation surrounding body image. The 23-time grand-slam champion was criticized for her shape and size. Two years ago, Williams published a letter online addressed to her mother sharing the struggles she's faced with people's body image expectations.

She wrote : ""It has been said I don't belong in women's sports -- that I belong in men's -- because I look stronger than many other women do.

""No, I just work hard, and I was born with this badass body and proud of it.""

Williams says her daughter Olympia shares the same physique and, in the letter, she expresses, ""I don't know how I would react if she [her daughter] has to go through what I've gone through since I was a 15-year-old and even to this day.""

""We don't all look the same. We are curvy, strong, muscular, tall, small, just to name a few, and all the same: we are women and proud!"" Williams said.

Okoro has also drawn inspiration from women athletes in rugby and football.

""They're not your stereotypical beauty queens but they are caring less about how they look and getting dirty and delivering some great performances.""

Okoro wants a new era of role models, or as she calls them ""real models.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/sport/marilyn-okoro-body-image-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
76,"The Winter Olympics don't really represent the world: Costs, climate and quotas keep the majority off the podium","(CNN) At 38, Benjamin Alexander became Jamaica's first ever alpine skier to compete in the Winter Olympics -- just six years after he first strapped on skis.

In his first few years in the sport, skiing with friends, he attracted a lot of attention.

""Being the only Black representative in the group, even though I am only half-Black and being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing jokes, sideways jokes at me about 'Cool Runnings,' the Jamaican bobsled team and, 'You should go to the Olympics,'"" Alexander told CNN Sport

Although the Summer Games are often heralded as a melting pot -- 11,417 athletes from 206 countries and regions across 33 sports participated in Tokyo 2020 -- the Winter Games are nowhere near as diverse, with 91 delegations taking part at Beijing 2022

That's five times more than the number of teams represented in the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France in 1924.

But athletes from Africa, South Asia, as well as those from smaller island nations still find themselves struggling to qualify for competition in the Winter Olympics due to warmer climates, the prohibitively high cost of equipment, lack of infrastructure and limited opportunities to practice and compete.

And one athlete and his coaches that CNN interviewed for this story warn that continental quota systems that allowed countries and regions with smaller Winter Olympic delegations the opportunity to establish and expand in sliding sports in PyeongChang 2018 were scrapped ahead of Beijing, with a knock-on effect on African countries.

A push for diversity, with limited success

More countries are making their debut in the Winter Olympics.

Saudi Arabia and Haiti each sent an alpine skier to Beijing while Nigeria and Eritrea competed in the Winter Games for the second time after making their debut in PyeongChang 2018. In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number.

But just five African countries participated in this year's Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia.

European and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.

But climate isn't the only factor affecting Olympic participation -- when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations.

At PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway -- one of the world's wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million -- topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it ""aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone.""

It allocates a ""substantial portion"" of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help ""athletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need.""

Some 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to ""support qualification efforts,"" according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships.

Only NOCs ""whose athletes had a proven winter sports track record"" had access to the program, the IOC said.

Meanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.

Athletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000.

European athletes received most funding from Olympic scholarships ahead of 2022 Winter Games Of the $7.5 million in scholarships issued ahead of Beijing 2022, athletes from Europe collectively received more than $5 million while athletes in Africa received just $177,000, according to the 2017-2020 IOC Olympic Solidarity report. Olympic Scholarships for athletes allocated to National Olympic Committee (NOC) ahead of Beijing 2022 (Rollover rectangles below for detail) (Tap rectangles below for detail) EuropeAmericasAsiaAfricaOceania Source: International Olympic committee

Scholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds -- derived from Olympic revenue -- towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.

CNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding.

Racial diversity not reflected

On a national level, the composition of delegations often isn't very racially diverse.

""There have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don't know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries,"" Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport.

Black athletes have proven crucial to Team USA's Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.

Prior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.

In 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA's first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies' figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002.

Hockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US.

Four years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy.

Overall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level. Though she demonstrated technical excellence in her routines, Black French skater Surya Bonaly never won an Olympic medal.

Surya Bonaly of France performs a backflip in her free skate routine in the women's Olympic figure skating in Nagano on February 20, 1998.

Bonaly performed a one-bladed backflip at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics -- an illegal move that was perceived as an act of defiance to the judges -- which she landed on one foot.

That move is still illegal and has never been tried since in an Olympic competition.

""They want to keep the girls pretty, in a special way,"" Bonaly told CNN Sport as she reflected on her career. Though now, according to Bonaly, ""people are changing and trying to challenge themselves, and try to have more personality in their own style. And that's good. And it's more accepted.""

Bonaly added: ""Now, back then ... you only came from one mold, one way.""

Black athletes are now prevalent in sliding sports: African American women comprise a majority of America's Olympic bobsled team.

Nathan Chen skates during the Men's Free Skating program at Beijing 2022 on February 10, 2022.

Asian American athletes, including figure skater Nathan Chen and snowboarder Chloe Kim, have also had a commanding presence at this year's Games.

Four of the six Team USA singles figure skaters were Asian American: Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Alysa Liu and Vincent Zhou. Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women's hockey player in US team history.

Pay to play economics

Experts say that economics -- not just talent -- plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics.

""That notion of economics is very key because we're looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating -- and that equipment alone costs so much,"" Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.

""Pay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money,"" Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN.

""It becomes not just a racialized issue, it's a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody's going to be a working-class hero,"" she said.

With stories of parents remortgaging their homes , working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children's Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.

Ghana's first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.

""This does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay,"" he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season.

Jamaica's first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: ""I'm competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young.""

""And now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement,"" he said.

In 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes' rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable.

The athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.

Shiva Keshavan , a six-time Olympian and India's only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.

""Athletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don't have the systems in place that enable a successful career.

""Often, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach,"" he added.

Many elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they're growing up.

Bode Miller -- the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals -- attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he ""wouldn't have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia.""

Parents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has ""earned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries.""

Privately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.

The study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.

""If your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski,"" Alexander told CNN.

""If we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don't have as much disposable income as their White counterparts,"" Alexander said.

Adding that he doesn't think"" winter sports are racist at all,"" Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports.

""I just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology ... then I believe the tide will turn.""

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it ""fully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games.""

""We have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality,"" it added.

""Some sports in all reality are more accessible,"" James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.

""But you can't sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you've got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there's factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven,"" he said.

""And that's not something that us at the IOC are going to change.

""All sports have different levels of access,"" Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport ""tries to look at.""

The IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations ""to ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports' structures and priorities.""

""Collectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport,"" it added.

Infrastructure challenges

Winter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia -- notably in Japan , South Korea and China. But it remains an ""unexplored market"" in India, Keshavan said.

""For India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.

""We don't really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities,"" he said.

This year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India's nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.

Khan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport.

Shiva Keshavan of India reacts following run 3 during the Luge Men's Singles on day two of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games.

""Of course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment,"" he said.

""Skiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training,"" he added.

Athletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come.

Frimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don't necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow.

""But that doesn't matter,"" he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said.

""You can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I'll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It's not like it's impossible,"" he said.

""Infrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in,"" Macleod told CNN adding: ""That's within the remit of the national government.""

""Often, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure,"" Macleod said.

""We as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa -- that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs,"" he added.

""Each of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, 'Actually, we're not going to invest in winter sports because that's not a priority for us.'

""'We're going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.' And they will always have to make that choice of where they're going to put their funding and what programs from our side they're going to apply for,"" he said.

""We put at the disposal of our stakeholders -- whether it's NOCs or the IFs (international federations) -- a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities,"" he said.

Representation matters

Carter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations' final offerings.

""For many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself,"" she added.

In winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique.

""If you don't see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do,"" she added.

Some sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said.

""But the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility -- and have the bobsled -- is very limited in general,"" she added.

Ahmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.

""We see a general trend in ... Summer Games -- you've got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You've got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes,"" Ahmed added.

Ditching continental quotas a step backwards for inclusion

Frimpong and Nigeria's Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation's (IBSF) continental quota system.

But the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games -- something coaches had warned would deliver a ""crushing blow"" to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.

Coaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that ""inequitable quotas that didn't take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.

""The dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport,"" they wrote.

Akwasi Frimpong of Ghana starts his men's skeleton training session at the Olympic Sliding Centre, during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 12, 2018.

Simidele Adeagbo of Nigeria reacts as she finishes a run during the Women's Skeleton on day eight of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 17, 2018.

""An exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible,"" they added in the email.

The quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing -- a decision which directly affected Frimpong.

""Giving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system,"" an IOC representative told Frimpong's coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN.

""I qualified as Ghana's first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa,"" Frimpong told CNN.

Frimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.

""Now, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games -- to be able to qualify outright,"" he told CNN.

On December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics.

Frimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant ""I could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good -- maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever -- but I'm good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners.""

Frimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports ""for qualified African athletes who can safely compete.""

""We're not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we're not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card.

""But if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there's enough African athletes,"" he added.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.

""To address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022,"" the organization said in a statement.

No athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal.

""We were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it's less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it's disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority,"" Frimpong added.

But there is hope -- even if only for a select few athletes.

American bobsledder Meyers Taylor's bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis' four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.

When asked about passing Davis' record saying, she said: ""That is overwhelming. It's so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I'm part of a legacy that's bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody.

""We want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be.

""So, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.""

77,"More than 1,000 students were sexually abused at this university. An ex-NFL player wants their stories to be heard","(CNN) Throughout the bitter winter, during rain and snow, Jon Vaughn has alternated between sleeping in a tent or a campervan outside former University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel's house.

A former University of Michigan and NFL football player, Vaughn is one of more than 1,000 people --- mostly men -- who says they were abused by athletics doctor Robert Anderson , who worked for the university from 1966 to 2003 treating students across sports including football, track, and wrestling.

Anderson, who died in 2008, subjected students, 90% of whom were men, to ""sexually abusive conduct"" and invasive exams, including unnecessary genital and rectal examinations, according to a 2021 independent report commissioned by the university. Many of Anderson's victims were Black -- and survivors say this has played a part in why the abuse was allowed to continue for decades.

In his roles at the university, including director of its health service, team physician for the athletic department and a clinical instructor at the university's medical school, Anderson abused men and women from different racial backgrounds, undergraduate and graduate students, student athletes -- including a two-time Super Bowl champion and former world-class wrestler -- and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, the report found.

The university missed numerous opportunities to stop him over his 37 year long career, it concluded.

This month the university announced a $490 million settlement with over a thousand victims of Anderson's alleged sexual abuse, pending approval by the Michigan Board of Regents and the claimants.

Dr. Robert E. Anderson worked for the University of Michigan from 1966 to 2003. He died in 2008.

But despite the settlement, the University is still facing calls to take responsibility for its role in the abuse, which spanned more than three decades -- as well as the university's failures to address alleged present day sexual misconduct and abuse by and of students and university staff.

Victims say that despite knowledge of Dr. Anderson's predatory behavior, U of M failed to take any action, and instead chose to continue enabling Dr. Anderson's abuse of vulnerable young men until his voluntary retirement in 2003.

""They've shown that over the last half century... [they're] uninterested in student safety as a priority,"" Vaughn, who played for U of M from 1988 to 1990 said.

""They've shown the inability to police themselves on a consistent basis, as pertains to sexual assault,"" he said.

Schlissel -- who was fired this month from his position as President following an anonymous complaint suggesting that he ""may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee"" -- has apologized for Anderson's ""tragic misconduct,"" and said in a statement that the university is committed to resolving victims' claims.

But Vaughn, 51, who was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and has been protesting for more than 100 days says he will continue to sleep outside the university president's house until the University of Michigan addresses historic and alleged present day abuse, after realizing how ""acute"" issues of sexual assault, violence and rape are on campus.

Vaughn is also one of many involved in hundreds of individual lawsuits and a class-action lawsuits filed against the University and the Board of Regents by survivors.

Black men treated differently

The allegations against Anderson mirror those against disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar at Michigan State University and Richard Strauss at Ohio State University. They too were doctors who abused their trusted positions to sexually exploit college students and athletes.

With more than a thousand people -- mostly men -- coming forward to say they were abused by Anderson, attorneys representing the victims say it may be the largest case of sex abuse by a single person in the US. The scale of the alleged abuse surpasses that at Michigan State, Ohio State, and similar incidents at other US universities.

But the case has received nowhere near as much media coverage as that of the abuse of Nassar.

A disproportionate number of the victims are African American, Vaughn told CNN.

""I don't think the world right now is ready to complete that spectrum of the face of abuse and include African-American men,"" Vaughn told CNN.

Attorney Mike Cox, who is representing 174 victims in confidential federal court mediation with the University of Michigan told CNN that some 40% of the 1000 Anderson victims are African American men.

""We have not done a formal analysis because all are victims and viewed equally in that sense. But clearly the amount of African American victim survivors is much, much higher than their numbers in American society,"" Cox told CNN over email.

Black Americans represent just 13.4% of the American population.

The percentage of African American survivors is also ""dramatically higher"" than their percentages as part of the UM student base, Cox said.

The University of Michigan agreed to work toward a goal of 10% African American enrollment by 1973, but did not reach this goal: Black student enrollment had declined by 1987 to 5.3% of the student body from the high of 7.7% in 1976 and never reached the 10% goal targeted by administrators in the early '70's.

From the 1980s until 1996, there was a 10% increase in African American student enrollment. However, efforts to increase African American enrollment to reflect the Michigan state's 14% Black population have been unsuccessful, according to the university.

Vaughn said it took years for him to even recognize what had happened to him as abuse, and that in communities of color, ""for men to even discuss their abuse is seen as a weakness. In those communities, you're forced to be tough and strong.""

""We've been fighting to have a voice, just typically in this country, for over 400 years, we're constantly and have historically been marginalized, or dehumanized in so many ways. So I really think those two factors create this perfect storm,"" he said.

Jon Vaughn says he will continue his protest at the university.

Attorney Parker Stinar, who represents around 200 of the survivors, agreed, adding that Anderson's case has not received anywhere near as much media coverage or public recognition as other sex abuse cases because the vast majority of survivors are older, Black men.

""For Larry Nassar, you had prominently White, 30-year-old women, whereas for Dr. Anderson, the vast majority of the survivors are Black and in their 50s, 60s and 70s. This case is overlooked in part because of that,"" he told CNN.

""I think our society looks down on men who are sexually abused, let alone big, strong, athletic, Black men who are sexually abused, compared to female survivors of abuse,"" Stinar added. ""Because they have this societal influence that asks men: How can they allow themselves to be sexually abused?""

Rebecca Wanzo, professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Washington University, St. Louis, told CNN that race plays a significant part in whether or how violence and abuse is reported by the media.

""If you don't have someone who's the face of something that they [the media] put forward, or seems like an ideal victim that people want to tell a story about, historically, that is something that can really affect the ability of a story to travel,"" she explained.

This, she said, is often an issue when it comes to reporting issues like sexual abuse and murder.

""Systemic violence often tends to get less attention, which is why violence against people of color, systemic violence in general, in terms of class and other factors, isn't reported,"" she said.

Racist stereotypes

""We don't have a language to talk about Black as rapeable in the US, because the racist stereotypes of Black men as the rapist and as violent stops us from looking at data that's been collected by the CDC for the last decade,"" Tommy Curry, professor of philosophy and personal Chair of Africana Philosophy and Black Male Studies at The University of Edinburgh told CNN.

Nearly 1 in 5 (19.4%) non-Hispanic Black men have experienced contact sexual violence -- which includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual contact -- in their lifetime, according to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010-2012, which is the latest published data broken out by race or ethnicity.

Social psychology data shows ""Black men are always perceived as being taller, more aggressive, or violent, more prone to conflict, more athletic than they actually are,"" Curry said.

""And it's those social perceptions that have been linked to forms of dehumanization -- likening them to apes, sorts of primal beasts and animals -- that fit into how we think of Black men, both as athletes and as kind of super predators, as superhuman.""

Attendees add their signatures to a board in support of survivors of sexual abuse at a vigil outside the home of outgoing University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel October 13, 2021 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Former gymnast Trinea Gonczar, who testified against Larry Nassar, told CNN that in her work supporting victims of sexual abuse, she has learned ""that most men, no matter what, if they've been assaulted, they won't report based on more shame.""

Nassar, the longtime doctor for the USA Gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges, and was also sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.

Gonczar has been spending time with Vaughn in his protest to show solidarity with abuse survivors at the University of Michigan.

""In my case, as a privileged woman, my perpetrator is in jail, we received a settlement. I'm White, and I come from an expensive, per se, sport: you have to have money to have to be in that sport,"" Gonczar said.

Gonczar now works as director of development at the Avalon Healing Center, which provides support for victims of sexual abuse.

""I've had to learn that I am a privileged, White person, and all abuse is not the same,"" she said.

There are several reasons why Black men choose not to report abuse, Curry told CNN.

""We know from interviews with Black male victims that it's not only the pressures of not being believed -- but it's also being perceived as the aggressor,"" he explained.

Curry said that his research had shown that in domestic violence cases, Black men would stay in situations of abuse, or they would not report victimization.

""They fear that the police or the criminal justice system or society is going to view them as the perpetrator and they'll be criminalized even harsher than the kinds of abuse and violence that they suffer,"" Curry said.

When Black men report that they have been victimized by others, ""different stereotypes activate"", Curry added.

""A lot of racists would say, 'No, he was really the aggressor, he tried to rape me, I wouldn't rape a man. It wasn't me. This person was violent or aggressive, or he's a drug dealer, a thief.'

""All these racial stereotypes are utilized to undercut the credibility of Black men who are victims in ways that other groups don't have to deal with,"" he said.

Conditions that enable abuse

Attorney Stephen Estey told CNN that Anderson was easily able to take advantage of his victims. ""Some of these men, they came from the inner city [which had] not the best healthcare in the back of the day,"" Estey, who represents some 80 survivors, said.

""Some of them never had a physical [examination], and so they didn't know what a physical should have been. And Dr. Anderson would tell them, if you want to play football, it's part of the process,"" Estey told CNN.

Wanzo said that a nationwide commitment to protecting athletic programs ""particularly makes Black people vulnerable in the US because they are disproportionately often in some of these programs.""

Anderson first served as a University Health Services doctor and was moved to the Athletic Department in 1981 after ""credible reports of misconduct"" were relayed to the then Assistant Vice President of Student Services Thomas Easthope in late 1978 or 1979, according to the WilmerHale report.

""The fact that they switched him out of general care to the athletic program as if they [athletes] were sort of disposable people says a lot about how the institution thought about how to deal with the problem person: they value athletics as institution, but the people who participate in athletics and make some money are disposable.""

Vaughn told CNN that there are a ""number of dynamics"" aside from race that help perpetuate ""this culture of abuse in sport.""

""I think it is the athlete's dedication to this specific sport, and the overwhelming trust that they tend to have in their coaches and trainers because of the focus that it takes to be successful in sport,"" Vaughn said.

Coaches and medical staff are often the most powerful people in a child and student athlete's life, he added.

If sports create the perfect conditions for abuse, then institutions are failing to regulate themselves, survivors say.

""It's really the institutions that are protecting their brands, and the position that they hold within that sport, because they really want that sport to be a catalyst for their financial gain instead of taking concern about their sports doctors who are actually predators,"" Gonczar, a gymnast who was treated by Nassar for 15 years, and who estimates that she was molested some 856 times, said.

A number of the women said they had reported Nassar's abuse previously but that the systems of authority, including USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Michigan State University, did not take their concerns seriously.

""Absolutely not enough has changed,"" Gonczar said.

""In the US it's taking so long to just simply get these big institutions to be aware and to be willing to be accountable and transparent, and to have people in the leadership roles that are willing to facilitate that,"" Gonczar warned.

Campus abuse between students ongoing issue

The University of Michigan finalized a new sexual and gender based misconduct policy in September, but critics say abuse and assault between students and by university staff still isn't being dealt with well enough.

Vaughn said that since he has been protesting, he has been approached by students who have told him of their own experiences of sexual assault and abuse at the university.

There were 157 allegations of sexual assault reported to the University's Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, according to its yearly report.

The University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which records incidents reported to the DPSS, law enforcement agencies and campus security authorities, described 18 on campus rapes and 31 reports of fondling not associated with Anderson in 2020.

Some 106 reports of sexual assault were made to the University's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC) in 2020, down from 151 in 2019 and 168 in 2018.

Vaughn says he has spoken to students who feel harrassment is still a problem at the university.

There were 77 reported instances of sexual harassment and 57 reports of stalking, according to the University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which provided the data as ""additional information regarding crime reports on campus.""

Campus enrollment in 2019 stood at 48,090 students, and 47,907 enrolled in 2020.

""All the reporting agencies within the university have essentially failed all the students and all the student athletes, because they've done nothing to support in any consistent manner, or protect in any consistent manner,"" Vaughn said.

""Professors have said if you support or even help report a student's standpoint, it's like a career suicide,"" he added.

Some 42.4 percent of Michigan students said they had experienced at least one type of harassing behavior since entering school, and more than a quarter (26.9 percent) of undergraduate women reported nonconsensual sexual contact, according to a campus climate survey regarding sexual misconduct.

Out of women who say they experienced harassment, 8.9 percent of Michigan undergraduates reported the person was a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker compared to an average of 4.8 percent of undergraduates and across the 33 schools surveyed in the overall survey, which looked at responses from a total of 181,752 students from 33 colleges and universities.

Some 31.8 percent of graduate or professional Michigan students reported their harasser to be a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker, compared to an average 16.5 percent in the overall survey.

Vaughn has slept in a tent and later, a trailer, to protest at the University over issues of sexual abuse and assault.

Vaughn has been protesting through harsh conditions at the University of Michigan.

The overall survey found that the 33 schools surveyed, more than half of undergraduate women (59.2%) and transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary students (65.1%) reported experiencing at least one harassing behavior.

""I speak to a lot of students, many of them feel like with the assaults that have happened to them, that the university has not been able to deal with it properly,"" Charlie Kolean, chairman of Michigan Students Against Sexual Assault told CNN.

""Typically, a case will not be criminally referred. And additionally, a lot of survivors from assault, they don't want to go through the university's process reporting the assault, because it is fairly arduous,"" he added.

Emma Sandberg, a former student and founder of activism group Roe v. Rape told CNN: ""Overall, it is very difficult to be a survivor at U of M. The sexual assault prevention center doesn't provide any real resources, university leadership has engaged in sexual misconduct themselves, and those who go through the all-consuming Title IX process are traumatized by it and rarely receive justice, support, or validation.

""We need a supportive center for survivors, not just a preventative one, and we need more effective prevention methods at all levels,"" Sandberg, who graduated in in 2021, said.

In addition to Anderson, at least five current and former university professors and officials have faced accusations of sexual harassment or abuse in the last few years.

In a statement to CNN, Rick Fitzgerald, associate vice president of Public Affairs and Internal Communications at the University of Michigan said: ""We encourage every incident of misconduct to be reported and we take action,"" pointing towards the university's annual report for further details.

""SAPAC has a 30-year history of supporting and advocating for survivors of sexual misconduct, through a range of supportive services, based on individual needs,"" he said, pointing towards the university's confidential resources for students and staff.

He added: ""The University of Michigan always has taken sexual misconduct seriously and we have been increasing our efforts steadily,"" and that a Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center has been on campus for almost 40 years.

Fitzgerald added that any case that involves criminal behavior is ""first turned over to police and the ECRT investigation is put on hold so that criminal activity can always be addressed first.""

Vaughn wants the university to overhaul its approach to misconduct.

""You cannot only celebrate parts of your history, you must deal with your entire history in order to root it out and change that culture,"" he said.

""Because the longer you ignore it, the more you perpetuate it and the more it empowers other predators, because they're watching the lack of discipline, or consequences for serial predators and rapists that then gives others the green light to make those decisions and prey on young men and young women.""

Co-lead class counsel attorney E. Powell Miller told CNN his team is seeking ""class action relief for reforms, policies and procedures to prevent an Anderson problem from occurring again.""

Attorney Jonathan Selbin, co-lead class counsel in a class action suit against the University, told CNN: ""While paying money to the victims is a critical first step, U of M must also commit to system-wide changes that bring all of the stakeholders together to reform the campus and institutional culture and prevent abuses like this from ever occurring again.""

Vaughn wants the university to create programs that empower students to report instances of sexual violence, and strengthen mechanisms to protect students.

Last July, the university announced revisions to how it will address sexual misconduct, including the creation of a new office with ""significant"" new resources for support, education and prevention. The office was launched in August.

""I knew that there was nothing that I could do in my protest to change what happened to me. But we could uncover the truth here at Michigan, and also make this place safer for now, and in the future, so that these atrocities don't continue to happen,"" Vaughn said.

""We want to change the narrative, as well as the culture. So until that's done, I won't be leaving.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/sport/university-of-michigan-robert-anderson-victims-intl-spt/index.html
78,"How Abdi Abdirahman, the oldest US runner to make the Olympics, weathered setbacks to reach Tokyo 2020","The distance of a marathon is 26.2 miles. As we go through US marathon runner Abdihakim “Abdi” Abdirahman’s road to Tokyo, we tick off the milestones and myriad challenges for competitors and organizers to reach this year’s Games.

The pandemic is likely to make it his most unique Games. Everything -- from the way he trained to the way the Games are being coordinated -- is a bit different from years past. In a typical year, Abdirahman and the rest of the US Olympic marathon team would head to training camp in Japan weeks in advance to acclimatize to the terrain and weather.

“It's been a difficult time … I'm just going to go out there and give it my best. I'm just going to worry about what I can control,” Abdirahman tells CNN.

But Abdirahman will tell you it was all worth it. This will be his fifth trip to the Olympics, and at 44, it could be his last.

In September 2013 -- following a vote in Buenos Aires, Argentina -- Tokyo was chosen as the host of the 2020 Olympics ahead of Istanbul and Madrid. It will be the second time that Tokyo has hosted the Summer Games, having previously done so in 1964. A large crowd watching at an outdoor screen in Tokyo cheered when the announcement was made at 5:20 a.m. local time, and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged that the city would stage “a safe and secure Olympic Games.”

He also really wants to compete in the marathon -- the race he’s been training for, for over a year. Qualifying for the Games was hard, and staying healthy and in shape during a pandemic was arguably even harder.

The Tokyo Olympics are finally happening and Abdihakim “Abdi” Abdirahman is ready -- despite new rules, no fans, and many protests against hosting the Games during a pandemic.

“I'm doing it for my country, not for myself. I want to bring peace in my country.”

Since November 2019, South Sudanese athlete Abraham Majok Matet Guem has been living and training in the Japanese city of Maebashi in Gunma prefecture -- about a two-hour drive from Tokyo. The 1,500m runner is one of four athletes from South Sudan, along with a coach, who have been based in Japan in the build-up to the Games. The athletes have gotten to know Maebashi residents, sampled the local fare and attended Japanese and computer classes four times a week. Maebashi is also offering financial support to the athletes through t-shirt sales and donations by local businesses.

Abdirahman is not the oldest Olympic athlete to ever run the marathon. Israel’s Seteng Ayele was 46 when he competed in the 2008 Games and Bohumil Honzatko was 49 when he ran for Czechoslovakia in 1924.

“To be honest, if I thought I could not compete with those guys, I would not have come to the [Olympic] Trials,” he says. “I wouldn't waste my time. But … I knew what I was capable of.”

On December 31, 2019, cases of an unknown viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, are first reported to the World Health Organization. The cases occurred between December 12 and December 29, according to Wuhan Municipal Health, but the virus was unknown at the time. On January 7, Chinese authorities identify the virus as a novel coronavirus, and four days later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announces the first death caused by the coronavirus.

A deep drive to compete and do his best, an undeniable love of running and an unwavering belief in his talent have helped Abdirahman maintain a professional running career of just over two decades. He describes himself as the type of person who pushes boundaries, especially when someone tells him he can't accomplish something. But that hasn’t quieted critics who have used message boards and social media to suggest his performance and career is on the decline.

“I don't look at age as ‘you’re old, you can't do this.’ Age is just a number. Just as long as you believe in yourself and you put in the work and dedication, why not?” he says.

With a time of 2:10:03, Abdirahman sealed his spot on the US Olympic team for the fifth time. He was 43 then, which not only made him the elder statesman on the 2020 US Olympic marathon team, but the oldest American runner ever to qualify for an Olympic marathon. Now 44, Abdirahman is also the oldest American runner to make an Olympic team.

Abdirahman was hardly a shoo-in going into the Olympic Trials; he was seeded 12th . But he was able to surpass top runners to finish third behind Riley and winner Rupp. “It was a hard race. When I crossed the finish line, I was relieved,” Abdirahman reflected in a 2020 interview.

It will mark the last leg of a journey that he started in February 2020. That’s when he and the other five members of Team USA’s Olympic marathon team qualified for the Tokyo Games. Galen Rupp and Jacob Riley are on the men’s team, and Aliphine Tuliamuk, Molly Seidel and Sally Kipyego are representing the women.

In July 2019, exactly one year out from the original opening ceremony, the Tokyo 2020 medals were revealed. Melded from copper and zinc found in donated cellphones and other electronics, the medals have a pebble-like appearance and measure 8.5 cm in diameter. Then in December that year, Tokyo’s 68,000-seat National Stadium was inaugurated. It cost 157 billion yen ($1.4 billion) and is scheduled to host the opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as football matches and track-and-field events during the Games.

When Abdirahman gets to the starting line, over 100 other competitors are expected to be there with him.

The marathon didn’t make an appearance in the Olympics until more than two thousand years later -- when Baron Pierre de Coubertin established the modern Games in 1896. Just over 20 men lined up at the start, but only nine ended up finishing the race. The winning time was 2:58:50 -- almost an hour slower than the current men’s world record . The 26.2-mile distance was made official in 1921.

The first iteration of the Games took place in 776 BC and only included races under 5K. The marathon was added much later — inspired by a mythic run from Marathon to Athens, Greece in 490 BC. Legend has it that a professional messenger named Pheidippides ran the 40-kilometer distance to deliver a message: the Greek Army had defeated the Persian Army.

The race will start in Sapporo’s Odori Park and then lead runners into the city to follow a three-loop course. Race walking events will also take place there, despite concerns and frustrations from city officials who don’t feel prepared to provide Covid-related health facilities or staffing for athletes and their delegations.

The men’s Olympic marathon is scheduled for August 8, the last day of the Games. If all goes according to plan, athletes will run the 26.2-mile race in Sapporo -- a hot and humid city that sits about 500 miles north of Tokyo, near the tip of Japan. It was chosen to host the marathon over Tokyo because its temperatures are slightly cooler.

Being vaccinated for Covid-19 is not mandatory for athletes. Pfizer/BioNTech pledged to donate its vaccine, but it’s unclear how many athletes have actually received the shots. Only about 23% of Japan’s 126 million residents have been fully vaccinated , but government officials are pushing to increase this number before the Games begin.

Athletes have also been asked to embrace artificial crowd noise because live spectators are not allowed. Chanting, high fives and hugs have been banned, while mask-wearing will be required unless sleeping, eating, training or competing. Athletes from countries severely impacted by the Delta variant will be subject to stricter surveillance before they arrive and after they leave Tokyo. A handful have tested positive within the Olympic village so far.

I don’t look at age as “you’re old …you can’t do this.” Age is just a number. You know, just as long as you believe in yourself and you put the work and dedication, why not?

Japan’s capital is under a state of emergency because of rising Covid rates, so he and roughly 11,000 other athletes will be subject to a range of strict protocols that limit socializing, physical touch and travel between all 42 Olympic venues.

But the pandemic and concerns over safety will keep Team USA at home up until about a week before the race. Abdirahman said he’ll arrive in Tokyo in late July.

""Adding another year … we have to keep on running before reaching the goal.""

After the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, Ryo Miyake, a Japanese fencer, saw his sporting career put on hold. Instead, he took up a new job delivering food for Uber Eats. A silver medalist at London 2012, Miyake turned to Uber Eats as a way to make extra cash and stay in shape during the pandemic. But the postponement of the Games proved to be a mental challenge, too. ""It's been very difficult. After all, the Olympics are like God, an absolute existence for athletes,"" Miyake told CNN earlier this year. ""It's like running a full marathon for four years … adding another year is like we have to keep on running before reaching the goal.""

Murray’s training regimen is based on his philosophy of simplicity, consistency and capping Abdirahman’s weekly mileage to help prevent injury. Abdirahman logs about 100 miles per week, which is low for elite runners. To hit this number, he runs almost every day -- including long runs (20 miles or more) at the weekend and speed work on the track. Weight training is also part of the routine.

Eventually, he returned to the training program he learned from his coach and mentor of over 20 years, Dave Murray. “I know Abdi in and out,” Murray tells CNN. “I know what's good for him in terms of training. We've been with him so long that I don't really need to coach him. I said, ‘Abdi, just do what we've been doing.’ And he knows exactly what I'm talking about.”

He also had to adjust training timelines and routines. At first, Abdirahman ran fewer miles than normal -- just enough to stay in shape. The members of his international training group, the Mudane Team , canceled a training trip to Arizona.

Abdirahman, who is based in Tucson, AZ, said he had to rely on money he received from his Nike sponsorship contract and his personal savings to make ends meet.

The lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame took place in Olympia, Greece, on March 12. Due to concerns over coronavirus transmission, the audience was kept small. The relay, scheduled to travel to all 47 prefectures of Japan over 121 days from March 26, was suspended the next day amid coronavirus concerns.

The postponement cost Olympic organizers, sponsors and broadcasters billions of dollars. Athletes were affected, too -- financially, emotionally and physically. Over the next several months, most of the major marathons -- Boston, New York City and Chicago -- were canceled. Access to facilities and teammates was limited and training schedules were prolonged. Without any races or training camps on the horizon, most professional runners lost out on significant sources of income.

“There are more important things in life than just the Games,” he says. “The Games will go on if life gets back to normal, and life wasn't normal.”

The NBA suspended its season, Major League Baseball postponed spring training, and eventually, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were delayed by a year. Abdirahman agreed with the decision.

In March, just a few weeks after the Trials, most sporting events around the world and in the US came to a halt.

According to the U S’ National Institutes of Health , after the age of 40, elite distance runners start to lose muscle fibers and slow down. But the global pandemic and an ankle injury, more likely than age, posed the greatest challenges to Abdirahman.

""It was disheartening, gutting, all those words, and it took some soul-searching for me to decide: am I able to continue to do this for another year?""

For husband and wife Sandi Morris and Tyrone Smith, the postponement of the Olympics was like being thrown into “purgatory.” Morris, a pole vaulter from the United States, and Smith, a long jumper from Bermuda, were forced to navigate a year of uncertainty when it came to their athletic careers, all while living and training in different parts of the US. For Smith, who is close to calling time on his athletic career, the postponement was hard to take. ""I probably experienced some mild depression once that announcement came,” he told CNN earlier this year. ""It was disheartening, gutting, all those words, and it took some soul-searching for me to decide: am I able to continue to do this for another year?"" Smith ultimately fell just short of his bid to qualify for a fourth Olympics, while Morris will look to add to her silver medal from the 2016 Olympics in Tokyo.

Abdirahman's friendship with Lagat continued to grow as both men thrived on the professional running scene. Abdirahman ran his second Olympic race at the 2004 Athens Games in the 10,000m event and finished 15th.

“Every single time I see Abdi, he’ll say, ‘tufanye kazi’ -- let’s do work, and then let's go, ‘twende.’ But it [twende] also has more meaning ... it's almost like: ‘I'm with you ... I'm feeling what you're feeling. I'm seeing what you see.’”

More than athletic talent, Lagat and Abdirahman shared a language in Swahili. They both hail from eastern Africa. Abdirahman lived in a refugee camp in Lagat’s native Kenya before coming to the US. Lagat said Abdirahman would often show support by saying two phrases in Swahili.

“He knew who to intimidate and not intimidate, so he could basically ruffle feathers with others ... he could talk trash to them … and then we would just laugh at each other,” recalls Lagat.

Five-time Olympian Bernard Kipchirchir Lagat currently coaches distance runners at the University of Arizona. He’s 46 and semi-retired from professional running now. But he competed against Abdirahman in his college years and remembers him as a talented athlete who liked to mess with his opponents.

As the coronavirus outbreak continued to spread across the globe, on March 24, 2020, Japan’s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed to postpone the Olympics until 2021, clarifying that the event will still be dubbed Tokyo 2020. The following week, the IOC announced that the Tokyo Olympics will be held from July 23 to August 8, 2021, and the Paralympics from August 24 to September 5, 2021.

Abdirahman improved and achieved success at college and professional levels. He was named the 1998 Pacific-10 Conference Cross Country Male Athlete of the Year and finished second at the 1998 NCAA Cross Country Championships. In 2000, he became a US citizen, qualified for his first Olympics Games in the 10,000m and got sponsored by Nike.

Abdirahman transferred to Arizona for his last two years of college and Murray’s intuition paid off.

“To see him running, he was fluid, like those Kenyans are, like the Ethiopians are. He just looked so smooth,” Murray continues. “So actually, I offered him a [full] scholarship to the U of A.”

“He was not any kind of a great runner in terms of scholarship material, but there was just something about him that I liked,” says Murray, now 79. Abdirahman’s times in the 10,000m and 5,000m were respectable but not jaw-dropping. Murray says he was running around 31 minutes and 15 minutes for each distance respectively.

He first met Murray in 1997. Abdirahman was running for Pima and Murray was an assistant coach for the University of Arizona. After watching Abdirahman run a few times, Murray decided to recruit him.

“A lot of my friends were in junior college and they were doing sports,” he recalls. “So I was always the last guy at the cafeteria when everybody goes to practice. And I just figured ... maybe when they go to practice, I can go to practice, too ... So I just wanted to fit in with the boys.”

He didn’t start running until 1995. He was 18 and had just entered Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona. His interest in track sparked from a desire to be social, not athletic.

Abdirahman was born in Hargeisa, Somalia and says he was 16 years old when he moved with his family to the US to escape the Somali Civil war .

""She couldn't describe it to me. She said you need to feel it on your own skin.”

She’s only just turned 19, but Larissa Iapichino is already gearing up for her first Olympics. The Italian long jumper has enjoyed a stellar year so far having broken the junior indoor world record with a jump that also equaled her mother’s national indoor record of 6.91 meters. Iapichino’s mother, Fiona May, competed at five Olympics during her career and has been passing on some words of advice. ""She said that you need to be there and feel the emotions, to feel the atmosphere that is typical of the Olympic Games,"" Iapichino told CNN. ""She couldn't describe it to me. She said you need to feel it on your own skin.”

“He's a father figure … and he continues to push himself and ... he inspires all of us. At that age, to make his fifth Olympics -- I think it’s something that should be celebrated,” says Farah, who narrowly missed qualifying for the 10,000m event in Tokyo. “And in fact, I was even joking around. I said, ‘Abdi, mate, you should be carrying the flag’ ... because often, people want to make one Olympics, and … here we go, he's making his fifth one.”

He first met Abdirahman at the World Cross Country Championships in 2000 in Portugal and they’ve been good friends ever since. Farah, 38, likes to point out that he’s younger than Abdirahman. But he won’t hesitate to acknowledge that he sees his Somali-born American friend as a role model too.

“My aim is to create a group where it doesn't matter where you're from, what color you are. You can come together and train, work, you can achieve something out of that,” Farah tells CNN.

As an athlete, you go to races, you want to want to win, you want to get a medal. And that's my goal. And you know what a lot of people will say, that's not realistic. But you get me to this point where I’m always believing in myself, anything can happen. We already know the clear favorite. But there's nothing guaranteed in life. Something can happen while you're running the race. So you know what? I’m just going to go out there, give myself a chance and compete the best and you know, my main goal is to win the race, but if I don't win it and I give it 110%, I'll be the happiest guy alive.

“As an athlete, you go to races, you want to want to win, you want to get a medal.”

Abdirahman met up with the crew in the popular yet developing district of Sululta, Ethiopia. They train there in winter, when it’s cold in the US and UK. Ethiopia’s high altitude and warmish weather make it an ideal training ground for serious distance athletes. The fact that it is home to some of the best distance runners in the world is added incentive. Farah, who is a four-time Olympic champion, is a founder of the group. He formalized it in 2016, along with Abdirahman and Abdi.

Mudane means sir or excellency (like a high-ranking official) in Somali. This is a small but expanding fraternity of Somali-born professional runners in the diaspora, like Bashir Abdi who represents Belgium, Abdi Nageeye in the Netherlands and Britain’s Sir Mohamed “Mo” Farah.

By January, his ankle healed and Abdirahman needed to get back into race shape. So he turned to his squad -- a group he’s relied on for friendship, hardcore training and fun for years -- the Mudane Team.

For the next three months, Abdirahman did exactly that -- he caught up with friends, family and the world events he doesn’t always have time to keep track of during the racing season.

“I think to be honest, it was a blessing because sometimes as an athlete, we just don't know how to rest ... And I said, ‘You know what? This will give me time just to recover, just to sit back ... just to think about something else besides running.’ And that was great,” he says.

He says his training was going well until October 2020, when he suffered a stress fracture to his ankle. But Abdirahman did not worry too much.

With just over four months to go until the opening ceremony and with plans for a scaled-down version of the Games well underway, Tokyo 2020 organizers announced that international spectators will be refused entry into Japan to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Days later, the Tokyo Olympic torch relay began in Fukushima, the site of a nuclear disaster 10 years ago.

After all the strain and disappointments, Abdirahman saw Tokyo as possible redemption. Then came the pandemic.

Abdirahman competed in the 10,000m race at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before transitioning to the marathon. He participated in the 2012 London Games but did not finish due to knee injuries. In 2016, he suffered another injury and missed out on qualifying for the Rio Olympics.

This was a competitive time that landed him in fourth place and ultimately convinced him that he could run the 26.2-mile race on the world stage.

Transitioning from the track to road races is common for distance athletes, especially as they age or are no longer fast enough to win at the elite level. Initially, Abdirahman was not thrilled. The marathon had never really been on his radar. But Murray said his stride pattern was perfect for the race, so Abdirahman gave it a shot, and in 2006, he ran 2:08:56 at the Chicago Marathon.

Murray also noticed that Abdirahman’s sprint “kick” at the end of races wasn’t getting stronger. Some critics suggested the runner’s career was over, but Murray recommended a change instead. “I said, ‘Abdi, I think as you are getting older now, you might start thinking about the marathon.’”

He continued to race the 10,000m and other distances for a few more years, winning several track and road competitions. But over time, he says, injuries hampered his progress and his performance fluctuated.

""But now, I think it's really about having some impact on my sport. I really want my legacy to be one of someone who fought for women.""

Allyson Felix is a veteran star of the USA track and field team having competed at four previous Games, but the past year has been unlike any other as she’s been forced to train on empty soccer fields, beaches and the streets around her home in Los Angeles. This will also be Felix’s first Olympics as a mother following the birth of her daughter Camryn in 2018 -- something she says is her proudest achievement. Over the course of her career, Felix’s vision for her legacy has shifted. ""I think if you had asked me that question years ago, it would have been records on the track or how fast I ran,"" Felix told CNN. ""But now, I think it's really about having some impact on my sport. I really want my legacy to be one of someone who fought for women.""

The team trained in Ethiopia for the first three months of 2021. Covid cases were rising at the time and testing was hard to come by. “You know, he inspires all of us in terms of, at that age to make that, his fifth Olympics. I think it's something should be celebrated.” Mo Farah Yeah, he's a father figure. We kind of often, you know, look up to him in a different way because he's a lot older than us. We have got a lot of respect for him, you know, he inspires all of us in terms of, at that age, to make that, his fifth Olympics -- I think it's something should be celebrated. And in fact, I was even joking around. I said, “Abdi, mate, you should be carrying the flag” because often, people want to make one Olympic, and him, here we go, he's making his fifth one. Show full transcript Ethiopia was hit hard by the coronavirus and just about one percent of the country’s roughly 112 million residents have been vaccinated. The vaccination rate in Somalia -- where most of the Mudane team members are from -- is similar. In comparison, nearly 50% of the US population is vaccinated. Abdirahman is among them and wishes the vaccine was more widely accessible throughout Africa and the wider world. He adds he was not able to get tested in Sululta and that most people he encountered did not wear masks, so he just did his best to stay safe. Abdirahman maintained that it was important to be there, despite the risks. He’s made training trips to Ethiopia since 2015. Both he and coach Murray say it’s helped improve his performance. “I think that was a major factor in making the [2020 US Olympic marathon] team this last time,” says Murray. “He came back healthy ... with a really tremendous distance base, and he had some of the greatest distance runners in the world to train with, like Mo Farah.” The Mudane training camp closed at the end of March, and Abdirahman and Farah continued altitude training in Flagstaff, AZ for about 10 weeks -- doing long runs and long intervals. But the amount of mileage and intensity of their workouts will decrease closer to race day. “Two weeks out from the Olympics will be taper time,” says Abdirahman. Murray advised him to return to Tucson for a few weeks before he heads to Tokyo, to help him reacclimatize to running in the heat. Tokyo dreams and beyond

When Abdirahman does arrive in Japan, his focus will be on staying healthy and following all the new Covid protocols. He’ll also be subject to a rule that’s connected to supporting social justice causes. In April, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced it would uphold Rule 50 -- a ban that prevents athletes from protesting or demonstrating at the Olympics. This is the same rule that penalized the podium protests of sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos during the 1968 Olympics. The IOC said its decision was based on a 10-month consultation process with over 3,500 athletes in all 41 Olympic sports. But earlier this month, the IOC amended the rule slightly, citing more feedback from the “global athlete community.” Now Olympic athletes can protest in mixed zones, press conferences and during interviews -- as long as the expression is “not targeted, directly or indirectly, against people, countries and/or their dignity.” Athletes can also protest on the field of play -- either before the start of competition or while they are being introduced. This move comes after the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee allowed Team USA athletes to hold up a fist, kneel and wear garments promoting racial and social justice at US Olympic and Paralympic Trials events. Hammer throw athlete Gwen Berry tested this policy when she turned away from the American flag during a medal ceremony at the Olympic Trials last month. She did it while the national anthem played and also held a t-shirt with the words ""activist athlete"" over her head.

Abdirahman did not comment on Berry’s protest and isn’t planning to engage in activism in Tokyo. But as someone who considers himself a proud American, issues like inequality and police misconduct trouble him. “Social justice is part of our lives and it got bigger during the pandemic ... Just imagine how many innocent people have suffered before this social media, these pictures, before cell phones,” he says. A closer look at the Olympic Marathon The Olympics’ first ever marathon in 1896 was won by 23-year-old Greek shepherd Spyridon Louis, who even found time to eat an egg and drink a glass of wine during the race.

According to David Goldblatt, author of “The Games: A Global History of the Olympics,” that first marathon “proved to be the most important event of the Games, generating the kind of modern mythological hero and collective stadium spectacle.”

American Joan Benoit Samuelson won the first women’s Olympic marathon, which was held in Los Angeles at the 1984 Games.

The 1952 Helsinki Games marked the first time the U.S. marathon team included a Black man -- Ted Corbitt. Tokyo 2020 will be the first time Black women -- Aliphine Tuliamuk and Sally Kipyego -- have been on the US marathon team.

Eliud Kipchoge, holds the men’s world record for the marathon, will be looking to defend his Olympic title in Tokyo. Among the favorites to win the woman’s race are Brigid Kosgei and half-marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich.

In October 2019, Kipchoge successfully completed the first ever marathon under two hours in the Austrian capital of Vienna, though the milestone didn’t count as a world record. He ran behind a car -- a condition not allowed under IAAF sanctions -- and was assisted by an army of 30 pacemakers. “As a Black man, I live Black Lives Matter. A lot of people say, ‘But why do they say Black lives matter? Do White lives matter?’ And I say, ‘Yes, White lives matter, too. Because at the end of the day, you don't suffer at the hands of the police every day like we do. So we are fighting. If you were suffering, if you go through what we're going through, I would support you.’”

Abdirahman has time to figure out exactly if and how he’ll get more deeply involved in social justice causes. He’ll take a break after the Olympics to recover and promote his book, “Abdi’s World.” When he retires from the sport, he says he’ll keep running for fun and consider coaching or teaching children. But for now, his focus is on training and medaling in Tokyo. He’s not considered a favorite going into this race and will likely need to finish well under his personal record of 2:08:56 to take home a medal. Kenya’s Samuel Wanjiru set the Olympic record for the marathon at 2:06:32 during the 2008 Beijing Games. The fastest-ever American performance in the Olympic marathon was 2:10:05 -- Rupp captured the bronze with that time at the 2016 Rio Olympics. 25.2 miles ‘Suicide mission’ As organizers pressed on with plans to host the Games, opposition among the Japanese public started to grow. In May, amid a fourth wave of infections in Japan, a petition calling for the cancellation of the Tokyo Olympics garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures. Hiroshi Mikitani, CEO of top Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, told CNN Business that hosting the Olympics amounted to a “suicide mission.” Abdirahman, whose voice rarely waivers from an upbeat, relaxed tone, acknowledges that he feels pressure to perform well. But the pressure is a bit different this time around.

Listen to this story 0:00 0:00

As an ambitious, determined teenager, Annet Negesa urged her body to run faster, and her body, always loyal, obliged her.

Even before the middle-distance runner had a coach, Negesa was qualifying for -- and winning -- major regional competitions. At 19, she would travel to Daegu in South Korea for the 2011 World Championships. After securing a top-three spot in the 800 meter and 1500 meter categories, in four international competitions, the Ugandan athlete qualified to represent her country at the 2012 London Olympics.

The following year, the young woman from Iganga, a small village in eastern Uganda, was named ‘Athlete of the Year’ by the Uganda Athletics Federation and seemed set for a life in the athletics spotlight.

That did happen -- but not in the way she had hoped. Much has been written all over the world about Negesa. Not only because of her victories on the track, but also because of what happened to her off it.

'I felt my life is over': Negesa shares her harrowing story

In August 2011, while at the World Championships, Negesa submitted to blood tests. According to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now known as World Athletics) this was a requirement for all athletes competing that year.

But Negesa says she never received her test results, and without them, life continued as normal: With intense training for the London Games.

It was while in Europe, just weeks before the competition, that Negesa would get a call from her manager, informing her that she could no longer compete at the Olympics.

She says he explained that the blood samples revealed levels of the hormone, testosterone, in her blood that IAAF considered too high and that at the recommendation of the athletics governing body, she would need to get further tests.

Negesa’s bright future quickly darkened from that point. She headed to a specialist hospital in the south of France, the name of which was provided by the IAAF. There, she underwent a medical assessment that involved a further blood test and an MRI scan.

Again, Negesa says she didn’t understand what was happening, nor was she given any paperwork. “No one gave me advice ... like: ‘If you do this, you’ll get this later.’ No one explained to me what the consequences are.”

World Athletics disputes this, saying in an email that “Ms. Negesa and her team were provided with the results of the tests undertaken.” The organization also adds that it subsequently advised Negesa by email “that it was important that a medical doctor in Uganda follows up with her, and explains to her what the different therapeutic options are.”

“They treated me like a guinea pig” Annet Negesa

In November 2012, after being taken to the Women’s Hospital International and Fertility Centre in Kampala, Uganda, the then 20-year-old woke up from surgery to learn her internal testes had been removed.

“I woke up finding myself having cuts under my belly and really, I was asking myself, ‘What happened to me? What they did to me?’”

Negesa says she had understood that she was being treated for hyperandrogenism -- the naturally high levels of testosterone her body produced -- but the surgery was not what she’d consented to. She says: “They gave me a suggestion of going for simple surgery or using an injection [to remove] the excessive testosterone in the body. My suggestion was using the injection.”

A medical report, seen by CNN, states that the doctors in Uganda “restrained from starting her on estrogen therapy,” claiming that they were “awaiting further discussions” with an IAAF doctor.

Estrogen was essential for Negesa’s recovery. Retired endocrinologist Peter Sonksen has not treated Negesa but noted the importance of estrogen in treating patients like her, saying: “Once the testes are removed, as in this case, the blood testosterone and estrogen levels fall to zero and the athlete is even more hormone deficient than a post-menopausal woman.” Sonksen adds: “It is essential therefore to give estrogen 'replacement' therapy. In [its] absence, [the athlete] will suffer multiple issues affecting most body systems.”

World Athletics told CNN it ""had no involvement in Ms. Negesa’s treatment"" and that CNN would ""have to ask [the doctor in Kampala] to explain the reference in this letter.""

In pain, and without the after-care that she needed, Negesa’s body could not perform as it once did. In an account of her story published by Human Rights Watch, Negesa shared that she lost her university scholarship, and then her manager dropped her.

Also facing public scrutiny for her sex, Negesa soon fell into depression, explaining that in Uganda, it was “very hard for a person like me… an intersex person.” In 2019, she was granted asylum by the German government.

What does it mean to be intersex? Intersex people have natural variations in reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male. These variations are sometimes called differences in sex development, or DSD. It is difficult to estimate how many people have DSD traits -- many live their entire lives without ever knowing they have one. Scientists estimate as many as one out of every 50 people is born with DSD traits. An intersex person may have any gender identity -- and may be cisgender or transgender -- depending on the sex they were assigned at birth. Modern medicine views sex as a spectrum with many variables. Intersex_Iconography_green_375px-ALL Intersex_Iconography_green_930px-ALL Chromosomes and genes Those with XX chromosomes are typically assigned female at birth. Those with XY chromosomes are typically assigned male. But people are also born with variations like XXY and X0. Genes linked to sex development can also influence things such as hormone production. Hormones There are several different hormones that are naturally produced at a range of levels in people of all genders and sexes. Sensitivity to hormones can also affect the development of anatomy and may cause anatomical variations that are not associated with typical binary categories of male or female. There is debate in the scientific community as to whether androgenic hormones like testosterone are useful markers of athletic advantage. Anatomy Some people assigned female at birth are born with internal testes; some people assigned male at birth have a uterus. Though many people are assigned a sex at birth based on external anatomy alone, there are many naturally occurring variations in both internal and external anatomy. Secondary sex characteristics Some DSD traits only become apparent at puberty, when secondary sex characteristics, such as facial hair, breast tissue or distinct body shapes start to develop. Some traits are only discovered when trying to start a family or through specialized testing that most people never undergo.

At a track in Berlin, in the shadow of the 1936 Olympic stadium, Negesa is still visibly stung by her experience. She tells CNN about feeling confused at the discovery that her body was different from what she understood it to be, and feeling powerless and completely unsupported as her life unraveled. “I was still a teenager, had no choice because I had a love of the sport ... and they knew all the consequences which would come out from them.”

Referring to the IAAF, she adds: “They violated my rights as a human being. They treated me like a guinea pig.”

The hospital declined to comment, citing confidentiality. In an email to CNN, World Athletics says: “The IAAF hyperandrogenism regulations state that the treatment must be prescribed by a physician who is independent from the IAAF, and that the IAAF is in no way involved in the process. Under no circumstances may the athlete be forced to undergo any specific treatment.”

A career derailed

In 2013, as Negesa struggled to come to terms with what had happened to her, in neighboring Kenya, Maximila (Max) Imali was learning that athletic success could lift her and her family out of a life of poverty.

She remembers her high school coach encouraged her to train for the 800m race, rather than the sprints, telling her: “You see that you can make your family be on another level of living.”

“I just wanted to run good so that I can feed them,” Imali says of her family: Her mother, two siblings, and two orphans she also provides care for. “I was so motivated.”

In July 2014, Imali got a chance to compete at the World Junior Championships in Oregon. “It was my first time to go to such a big race,” she recalls. “And after that, I realized that I can do good.”

She excelled in the heats but fell in the finals of the 800m event.

“After I came back home, [I] sat and discussed with the coach how I can improve and what is the best thing for me to do, so that I can do good in 800m and 1500m,” she says.

But Imali didn’t get that chance. The young woman, who was quickly gaining national and international recognition, also got caught in the crosshairs of IAAF regulations.

Once in Kenya, Imali says she received a call from an official with Athletics Kenya, telling her: ""Maximila, they want you to be tested from the IAAF.”

“God wanted me to be the way I am” Maximila Imali

So, Imali took a matatu minibus from Eldoret to a hospital in an upscale Nairobi neighborhood for a blood test and a physical examination.

Consistent with Negesa’s account, Imali says she was given little information about the procedures or their consequences. Referring to the hospital’s physicians, she says: “They did not tell me anything concerning my body. After we did every examination, they were just putting the results in the envelope. Then they take that envelope to Athletics Kenya.""

It would be several months before Imali would learn from her manager, over a phone call, that she would not be allowed to compete in the 800m category.

She says she was told: “Max, you cannot run because you have high testosterone in your blood.” He went on to list all the races she could not compete in and shared a letter from IAAF explaining the regulations.

Weighed down by the questions about her gender identity that the assessments had thrown up, Imali went to speak to her mother. What she heard reassured her. “For me, I've been raising you like a girl from the start when you were born, and that is it. I know you are a girl,” she recalls her mother saying.

But Imali says that being rejected for how God made her, as well as the questions about her sporting, future all took a toll on her mother’s health, and in September 2016, Eunice Khaleha died.

“My mom was hospitalized because of me, because of the pressure,” Imali says, her voice filled with sorrow and regret. “She died because of me. It still affects me because I always feel that I'm the cause of her death.”

‘Pull up your shirt, and push down your pants’

Many sporting events, from track and field to gymnastics, swimming to basketball, are divided according to a binary separation of genders. Modern medical consensus notwithstanding, as far as much of the sports world is concerned, there are only two recognized categories: Men and women.

However, Negesa and Imali both have -- or had -- levels of testosterone that their sports’ governing body officials deemed too high for some of the women’s competitions.

World Athletics now has a set of rules for athletes with what it calls differences of sex development (DSD), requiring them to lower the naturally occurring levels of testosterone in their blood to 5 nanomoles per liter of blood (5 nmol/L) through medication or surgery if they want to compete in certain races.

What are World Athletics’ rules on testosterone? In 2019, World Athletics banned some athletes from competing in international women’s middle-distance races unless they used medical interventions to lower the testosterone that occurred naturally in their bodies. The restriction targets athletes who compete in women's events and have certain differences of sex development (DSD). testosterone-mobile 30 testosterone-desktop These are the testosterone ranges that World Athletics considers ""normal"" for men and women. Their ""DSD regulations"" apply to athletes competing as women, but not as men. The restrictions apply to athletes who are ""legally female (or intersex)"" with all of the following: Blood testosterone in the range of 5.0 nmol/L or higher

""Sufficient androgen sensitivity"" (i.e., ability to use testosterone)

XY, and not XX, chromosomes

Testes and no ovaries These athletes need to lower their testosterone levels to under 5 nmol/L in order to compete. To do so, the affected athletes are asked to either: Take a daily oral contraceptive pill

Take a monthly injection of a hormone blocker

Remove testes through surgery

Non-compliance means that athletes with DSD cannot compete in events such as the 400m or 800m races put on by World Athletics.

Most high-profile among the athletes affected by the DSD regulations is South African runner and Olympic champion Caster Semenya, whose long-fought legal battle to be able to compete in the 800m event is currently before the European Court of Human Rights.

After her lawyers filed their lawsuit to the court on February 25, Semenya tweeted: “This fight is not just about me, it's about taking a stand and fighting for dignity, equality and the human rights of women in sport.”

While Semenya’s dispute with World Athletics is over a decade old, the fight to compete on equal terms goes back almost a century.

A history of sex testing in women’s athletics 1930s Public scrutiny Scrutiny of women's bodies has played out in the public eye at least since the 1930s, as women's athletics gained greater visibility. Ahead of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Avery Brundage advocated for systematic medical examinations of athletes competing in women's events. At the 1936 Games, 100m gold medalist Helen Stephens was accused of being a man. The American runner underwent -- and passed -- the first sex test administered at an event. She is pictured here (left) with Poland’s Stella Walsh, the 100m silver medalist. 1960s ‘Nude parades’ The first systematic sex tests took place at the 1966 European Athletics Championships in Budapest, where women underwent a visual examination of the genitals and secondary sexual features, carried out by a panel of three women doctors. The exams have been referred to as ""nude parades."" ""You had to go in and pull up your shirt and push down your pants,"" said Maren Sidler, an American shotputter at the 1967 Pan-American Games in Winnipeg. ""I remember one of the sprinters -- a tiny, skinny girl -- came out shaking her head back and forth saying, ‘Well, I failed. I didn’t have enough up top.'” 1967 First disqualification Polish sprinter Ewa Klobukowska, an Olympic gold medalist, failed a sex test at the 1967 European Cup in Kiev. It included a chromosomal test after a visual exam was determined to be ambiguous. 1968 New IOC testing The IOC introduced Barr body testing at the Mexico City Olympics, calling it “simpler, objective and more dignified.” The test was based on cells collected from the inside of athletes' cheeks and was thought to indicate an athlete's chromosomal makeup. Medical experts now criticize the Barr body test as inaccurate and harmful; failing to recognize the complexity of factors that determine sex. 1985 A ban is reversed Spanish hurdler María José Martínez-Patiño was banned from competition in 1985 after a test revealed a Y chromosome. She was reinstated three years later, after proving she had complete androgen insensitivity, meaning her body doesn’t respond to testosterone. 1990s Mandatory testing ends The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ended mandatory sex testing in 1992 and the IOC dropped blanket testing in 1999 -- but they continued to conduct medical evaluations on a case-by-case basis. 2009 Uproar as Semenya triumphs on track South Africa's Semenya won the 800m at the World Championships in Berlin in 1:55.45. Afterwards, the IAAF required Semenya to undergo a "" gender verification"" process. The ANC -- South Africa's ruling party -- called the tests ""sexist and racist."" 2011 A shift to testosterone The IAAF released new regulations declaring that an athlete could only compete in women’s events if her testosterone levels were below 10 nmol/L, unless she had ""androgen resistance."" 2015 Rules suspended after court ruling The rules were suspended for two years by CAS after a legal challenge by Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, who had been banned from competition because of her naturally high testosterone levels. CAS cited a lack of evidence on the relationship between testosterone levels and improved athletic performance in women. 2016 Athletes with DSD excel in Rio Free to compete after the 2015 CAS decision, Semenya won gold in the 800m at the Rio Games in 1:55.28. Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba and Kenya's Margaret Wambui -- who would also be affected by later rules on natural testosterone levels -- take home the silver and bronze. 2019 Testosterone regulations reinstated World Athletics, formerly the IAAF, introduced new regulations for middle distance races from 400m to a mile: women with ""sufficient androgen sensitivity"" and testosterone levels of 5 nmol/L and above must reduce their levels through medication or surgery. Semenya appealed the regulations to CAS -- and lost the landmark case. In order to meet current World Athletics standards, she will have to reduce her testosterone levels if she wants to race the 800m again.

The attention didn’t come exclusively from the sporting bodies. Media commentators over the decades have helped peddle a narrow vision of what it means to be -- and to look like -- a woman.

Three days after the opening of the Rome Olympics in 1960, William Barry Furlong, reporting for The New York Times, wrote a piece entitled “Venus Wasn't a Shot-Putter,” in which he reflected: “More and more of the fair sex are competing in sports, raising a profound question: Do men make passes at athletic lasses?”

As “gender-normalizing” surgeries became more common in the Global North, and more athletes from the Global South have come to dominate in track and field events, it is Dutee Chand, Maximila Imali, Annet Negesa and Caster Semenya -- among others -- who have come into the media spotlight and under World Athletics’ watchful gaze.

“World Athletics wants to recognize people however they identify,” World Athletics’ legal counsel, Jonathan Taylor, tells CNN. “The problem with that is, on the sports field, we've already established that there has to be a distinction between male and female competition in order to promote fairness and equality.”

He continues: “Once you've decided that, once you've drawn a line, you have to classify people and that means deciding why the line is drawn.”

Taylor positions World Athletics as being in a bind: Needing to weigh in on an issue it would rather not have to, but must, in order to take away, as he puts it, the “enormous, insuperable advantage that's conferred by these higher testosterone levels'' in events such as the 400m, 800m, 1500m and 400m hurdles races -- all of which World Athletics classified as “restricted events” in 2019.

“If you have someone with a female gender identity, but XY testes and male levels of testosterone, you have to decide what to do. You could say: ‘You cannot compete in the female category’, which World Athletics does not want to do, because it wants to acknowledge and recognize the gender identity. So instead, they say you have to drop your testosterone down to the same levels as all the women and all the other women in the category,” he says.

Contrary to Taylor’s claim, “all women'' in the category do not have the same testosterone level.

Under World Athletics’ rules, an athlete with polycystic ovary syndrome, for example, can compete despite having high testosterone because they have XX chromosomes and no testes. Athletes with high testosterone levels whose bodies do not respond to the hormone can also compete in the restricted categories.

And so World Athletics, in so doggedly guarding the line it has drawn, has positioned itself as an arbiter of what it means to be a woman in sport. Taylor says it's done ""to promote fairness and equality.” But the rules are based on scientific research that is heavily contested.

Does testosterone affect athletic performance?

“There is good evidence to show muscle bulk increases with increasing dosage of testosterone,” Sonksen, who has previously spoken out in support of Semenya, said in an email to CNN, but adds that the relationship between blood testosterone level and performance remains “complex and controversial”.

“Measuring blood testosterone level gives some indication of the amount that is produced and testosterone does increase protein, thus muscle synthesis, but [the hormone’s] action is regulated also by other factors,” he explains.

“[World Athletics] are trying to refine further and further as the policies come under scrutiny. But the science is still very much contested,” says Katrina Karkazis, anthropologist and co-author of ‘Testosterone: An Unauthorized Biography’, a 2019 book which sets out to debunk some of the myths around the hormone.

When it comes to athletic performance, Karkazis and her co-author, Rebecca M. Jordan-Young, write about studies that have linked high natural testosterone to speed and power, studies that found no link, and yet others which show the converse to be true: High testosterone leading to worse performance.

Karkazis told CNN that the lack of conclusive evidence hasn’t stopped World Athletics from forming its policies. She cites, by way of example, a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which states that in the 1500m and 1 mile races, the evidence of actual significant athletic advantage “could be described as sparse.” CAS recommended that “The IAAF may consider deferring the application of the DSD regulations to these events until more evidence is available.”

“Even when the evidence wasn't there, [World Athletics] decided to include it and regulate it anyway,” says Karkazis.

Not only are these regulations -- introduced and enforced without consensus from across the scientific community -- being framed as good for the games, Taylor, speaking for World Athletics, also suggests that they are good for athletes with DSD.

“We're not stopping people from competing,“ Taylor tells CNN. “We are trying to facilitate their competing” before adding: “One of the benefits of the regulations is that you identify and diagnose and treat DSD conditions as well.”

But there is increasingly vocal pushback from parts of the medical community, parents and intersex people themselves, saying that being intersex isn’t a medical “problem” to be “solved” any more so than being born male or female is one.

Ahead of Tokyo, the fight for acceptance continues

At the last Olympics -- the 2016 Rio Games -- Caster Semenya, Burundi’s Francine Niyonsaba, and Kenya’s Margaret Wambui took the gold, silver and bronze medals respectively in the 800m race.

This year, in Tokyo, none of these women will be competing in that category -- all three impacted, they say, by World Athletics’ rules regulating testosterone in women.

In its pursuit of fairness, affected athletes and activists alike say that World Athletics has itself been deeply unfair.

Speaking to CNN from London, academic and athletes’ rights advocate, Payoshni Mitra, says: “Rules could be necessary in sport, but those rules should also ensure safety of athletes. No rules should lead to human rights violations, and these rules are leading to human rights violations of athletes.”

For Mitra, World Athletics’ rules aren’t just sexist, they are also racist. “It clearly seems to be racist policy,” she says. “We have women's bodies from the Global South -- brown women, Black women -- in sport. Their bodies have been scrutinized more and more. It's a fact which they cannot deny.”

Taylor denies this, countering: “What we're trying to do is ensure a level playing field for all women -- of whatever color -- so that they can all aim to excel.”

The South African government didn’t see it the same way, with the then-Minister of Sports, Tokozile Xasa, weighing in to lend support to Semenya after World Athletics proposed new regulations in 2019: “Women’s bodies, their wellbeing, their ability to earn a livelihood, their very identity, their privacy and sense of safety and belonging in the world, are being questioned.”

And so, from Mitra’s perspective, it is difficult to understand World Athletics’ “adamant” focus on DSD regulations when there has already been so much suffering, so much at stake for the individual athletes, so much to lose, and so much else for the sporting world to address.

“Why they're so adamant about these regulations is really difficult to understand, given that there are so many other problems in the sport. Doping is such a huge problem in athletics. If you look at issues concerning safety of women, sexual harassment and abuse, these are such important issues in sport today … [World Athletics’ leaders] just want these people to go. They just want a purified notion of women's category without any of these athletes … What World Athletics tend to forget is athletes are human at the end of the day.""

What those athletes say they want more than anything is to do what they love, without special scrutiny or restriction. They want to run as equals.

80,Navid Afkari: Executed Iranian wrestling star's voice is 'everywhere now',"Wrestler Navid Afkari was executed by the Iranian government on September 12, 2020. The story of his life and the movement he has inspired is being republished by CNN International to mark the anniversary of his death. This article was first published on June 28, 2021.

(CNN) It was the worst news that anybody could have woken up to; as Sardar Pashaei reached for his phone one morning in September, he knew immediately that something terrible had happened.

""When I woke at about six or seven o'clock in the morning,"" he told CNN Sport, ""I see a lot of phone calls from Persian television. And when I listened to the voicemail of my journalist friend, I just cried. I couldn't control my tears.""

The Iranian Pashaei, who was the 1998 Junior 60-kilogram Greco-Roman World Wrestling champion, has been living in self-imposed exile in the US since 2009.

On that fateful morning, he learned that another Iranian wrestler, Navid Afkari , had been executed, hanged for a crime that his family and friends say he didn't commit.

Pashaei, who was close to Afkari's coach in Iran, had been campaigning hard to save his life. It was a campaign that ended brutally with a hangman's noose, but in the months since Afkari was silenced, his voice seems only to have grown louder.

An ancient sport

Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in Iran and it is one of the most popular. Ever since winning their first Olympic wrestling medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Iranian wrestlers have excelled at the Games, returning home with a total of 43 medals to date, more than double the haul in their next best sport -- weightlifting.

Pashaei says that there's a wrestling gym ""in every corner of every city in Iran,"" and successful wrestlers there are treated differently, enjoying an elevated status in comparison to other athletes. They're on a pedestal.

Iranians wrestle during a workout session at the traditional Shir Afkan ""zurkhaneh"" (House of Strength) gymnasium in the capital Tehran in February 2018.

The ancient sport is naturally aggressive and competitive, but experts say it's a combat sport borne out of a practice to promote inner strength through outer strength.

When viewed through such a lens, wrestling might not seem too dissimilar to yoga. The spirit of wrestling is deeply engrained in Iranian culture, where it has transcended the arena of sport.

Max Fisher wrote in The Atlantic in 2012 that ""The ideal practitioner is meant to embody such moral traits as kindness and humility and to defend the community against sinfulness and external threats.""

One could argue that it was these very qualities that got Afkari executed -- by his own government.

'He was the best one'

Afkari was born on July 22, 1993, and raised in the city of Shiraz; located in the southwest region of Iran, it's one of the oldest cities in Ancient Persia and known to be a hotbed of poets, literature, flowers and wine.

Legend has it that the famous Syrah grape, grown as far afield as the Rhône Valley in France and in the new world territories of Australia, New Zealand and California, first took root in Shiraz.

It was here that a young Afkari learned to find his way in the world. One of five children, he discovered wrestling at the age of nine and quickly dedicated his life to the sport.

By the time he was 17, he was good enough to be included in a group of eight wrestlers in the 69-kg category that attended a national training camp. Six years later, Pashaei says Afkari was ranked second in his division and on track to fulfill his dream of one day becoming an Olympic champion.

Parents will usually try to avoid having a favorite child or revealing the truth if they do have a preference, but Afkari's three brothers and sister knew their place in the family.

Sources close to them say that he was the apple of his mother's eye; Afkari was successful, but modest, and he was never a burden to them.

A family member, speaking to CNN Sport only on the understanding that their identity would be protected, described Afkari as ""the nicest member of the family,"" adding that his friends would agree: ""He was the best one.""

Navid Afkari (bottom left), sitting with his brother Vahid (top left), brother Saeid (bottom center), Habib (bottom right) father (top center) and mother (top right).

Videos of him with his hands in the air, dancing and singing at home during Persian New Year, and somersaulting acrobatically into a swimming pool confirm the family's description of Afkari as ""enthusiastic, full of energy and excitement."" Such positivity would rub off on those closest to him, especially within his family.

They say that he wasn't particularly interested in politics, but he was keen to help out in the community, making donations and helping the poor, and he was troubled by the culture of discrimination in Iran, especially against women and those living in poverty.

That's why Afkari took part in the seismic demonstrations that swept through the country in 2018.

Initially, these were protests against the government's economic policies, but they soon morphed into political opposition of the theocratic regime and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and were regarded as the most significant domestic challenge to the government in almost a decade.

Afkari was concerned about rising prices in Iran, so -- along with millions of others -- he took to the streets to protest. His family says he was frustrated by corruption and poverty and worried that daily life was no longer affordable to many of his compatriots.

It was a fateful decision that would end up costing him his life.

A forced confession / A lack of evidence

According to the official version of events, Afkari killed Hassan Torkman, a water company security employee, during a protest in Shiraz on August 2, 2018.

Afkari and his brother, Vahid, were arrested a month and a half later, on September 17 according to the UN, and another brother, Habib, was rounded up later that year.

Afkari was condemned to death; Vahid and Habib received prison sentences of more than 33 and 15 years respectively and all were to be punished with 74 lashes each, according to Amnesty International.

Initially, Afkari confessed to the crime, but in court he retracted those words, arguing that he had been tortured during his interrogation by ""men with hats, glasses and masks on,"" and that a false confession had been forced out of him.

His supporters say that his trial was devoid of any compelling evidence, and in fact, the only video evidence available, from a closed-circuit television camera, would have been more likely to prove his innocence.

Afkari's attorney, Hassan Younesi, told the Center for Human Rights in Iran that ""There is no visual evidence of the moment of the crime, and the film presented in this case shows scenes an hour before the time of the murder.""

In this June 2018 photo, a group of protesters chant slogans at the main gate of the Old Grand Bazaar, in Tehran, Iran. The case of 27-year-old Navid Afkari has drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrays him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran's Shiite theocracy in 2018.

An audio recording was made in the court and leaked by human rights activists; in it, an agitated Afkari, speaking in a high-pitched voice, can be heard pleading with the judge, who seems to have little interest in giving him a fair hearing.

Such recordings of court proceedings are extremely rare in Iran and whoever made it and released it would have done so at great personal risk.

The prosecution claimed to have video evidence of the crime committed at the specific time of 11:32 p.m., but according to the audio tape, it was never shown in court and the defendant was never able to see it for himself.

""Why are you afraid and will not show the film?"" demands Afkari. ""We are not afraid of anything,"" responds the judge.

On the recording, Afkari demands that his witness, Shahin Nasseri, be heard, somebody who can testify to the abuse he experienced while being held in police detention for nearly 50 days.

In a complaint filed with the judiciary in September 2019, Afkari described ""the most severe and physical psychological torture,"" but according to Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, the head of the Fars Province Judiciary rejected claims that Afkari had been beaten or tortured and, in court, he was dismissed out of hand.

""Not related. Not the time for it, sit down, don't talk anymore!"" ordered the judge on the recording. ""You do not have a defense.""

The Iranian government has said repeatedly that Afkari was not tortured and that his confession wasn't forced. CNN has asked the government if he received a fair trial, but we have not received a response.

The execution

According to the Afkari family, his final days were brutal, but there wasn't necessarily any reason to think that the end was near.

The family says that he was kept in solitary confinement for a week and ""beaten by 20 guards,"" before being told that he and his brothers were being moved from the prison in Shiraz to the capital, Tehran.

That was a lie; instead, Afkari was executed on September 12th, at the age of 27. Much later, family members learned that Vahid and Habib were in a cell close to the gallows where they had heard their brother die.

His body was returned to his family in the middle of the night, and they say he was denied a proper burial. The authorities had already dug a hole in the dirt and that's where Navid was expected to be placed.

In the months that have passed since, he has hardly been able to rest in peace. The family has tried to honor Afkari, by placing a stone to inscribe in remembrance and a wall to protect it, but they say it was broken down by the authorities with a bulldozer.

As the Afkaris tried to prevent further damage, the father was arrested, and they were cautioned that the whole site could be completely destroyed.

Iranians in Canada on Mel Lastman Square demonstrate against the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by the Iranian regime, in Toronto, Ontario in September 2020. The death sentence caused international uproar, yet the regime persisted.

As such, Afkari's final resting place is now just a simple grave.

His death was a crippling blow to those who had loved him and also to those who had never even met him.

So successful was the campaign to raise awareness of his plight that Dana White, the head of UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) asked then US President Donald Trump to appeal to Iran for clemency.

Unfortunately, though, their efforts were in vain.

Speaking shortly after Afkari's death in a press conference, White tried to make sense of it all but could only conclude that ""he was fighting for what he believed in. And it cost him his life.""

One UFC fighter, Bobby Green, was so emotional that he could think of nothing else after beating Alan Patrick in Las Vegas.

Green, who was a wrestler himself before turning to Mixed Martial Arts, cut short his post-fight interview by saying, ""Somebody just lost their life for protesting; that just messed me up. I thought we were going to be able to save him. That is so sad, it broke my heart. I don't even want to talk right now.""

Inciting a culture of fear

Afkari was one of at least 267 people who were executed in Iran in 2020.

A report compiled by Iran Human Rights and advocacy group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) concluded that Iran can boast of the highest number of confirmed executions in the world per capita, and that The Islamic Republic uses executions ""as a tool to oppress political dissidents, including protesting citizens, ethnic minorities and journalists.""

IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam explained that the regime creates fear through the death penalty to maintain power, but that fear is now waning.

""Protests in recent years,"" he said in the report, ""have shown that not only are people losing their sense of fear but they are also uniting in their anger against these executions.""

Navid's mother (left) stands by Navid's grave in March 2021 in Shiraz, Iran.

While still grieving, Afkari's friends and family are dealing with further intimidation.

His former coach, Mohammad Ali Chamiani, says he has been warned not to talk about him, and just in case there is any misunderstanding, he's been banned from teaching wrestling, sacked by his gym and stripped of his benefits and insurance.

It's a humiliating end to Ali Chamiani's career; until recently, he was revered, considered on three separate occasions to be the top wrestling coach in the country.

The family is now concerned for the safety of their other sons in prison but they say that Afkari has prepared them to be strong.

Throughout the two years that he was imprisoned, family members say he was building them up, allaying their fears where possible and ensuring that they'd be able to continue his struggle when he was gone.

He knew that he was going to be put to death, but in his last night alive, his family says he called them to say that he was doing OK, asking them not to worry.

United for Navid

Afkari may be gone, but his voice is now louder than ever. The recording of him defiantly challenging the judge can be found all over social media, so, too, an audio recording that he made while he was in jail.

""During all the years that I wrestled,"" he states calmly, ""I never faced a cowardly opponent who played dirty because wrestling is an inherently honorable sport. But it's been two years that my family and I have had to face off against injustice and the most cowardly and dishonorable opponent.""

Upon realizing that his legal challenge was destined to fail, he concluded, ""They are just looking for a neck to throw their noose around.""

One of his most prominent supporters is Masih Alinejad, an exiled Iranian journalist, author and political activist, who's now living in New York.

She never met Afkari, but she later learned that he had reached out to her during the protests.

People protest against Iran's death penalty opposite Downing Street as a march to demand a people's vote against Brexit passes by on October 2018 in London, England.

On February 12, 2018, Alinejad had posted an image on Instagram of an Iranian woman who'd been arrested for protesting the compulsory headscarf (Hijab) law.

Among the list of 1,648 comments was one from Afkari, whose public courage and audacity would have been inconceivable to many in Iran.

In Farsi, he posted a direct attack on the Supreme Leader, a line which translates to ""I spit on your rotten soul."" Alinejad's original post received over 71,000 likes and could have been seen by any of her five million followers.

Alinejad told CNN that it was Afkari's brief comment, quickly lost in the sea of social media, that has posthumously formed such an unbreakable bond between them.

""I was shocked at how brave he was,"" she told CNN Sport. ""He cursed the Supreme Leader of Iran, in public, under his own name. That is why I care so much about Navid. That actually breaks my heart. I did my best, but sometimes I feel miserable and frustrated that we couldn't save him.

""We have so many Navids now fighting for freedom,"" Alinejad explained, ""fighting for equality, fighting for justice, fighting for dignity, fighting to have a normal life, fighting to get rid of dictatorship.""

Alinejad believes that the government viewed Afkari as a threat and moved quickly to silence him, using his execution as a deterrent to others, adding, ""His only crime was just joining Iran protests and that scares the government. The government actually wanted to create fear within the society.""

But his execution might prove to have been a miscalculation; it may have backfired.

Alinejad is the campaign founder of United for Navid, an action group that is keeping his voice alive.

Afkari's sacrifice has motivated many Iranian athletes to find the courage to step up and speak out; while some want politics to be separated from sport in their country, all agree on the need for even greater reforms.

She understands the risks that many of them are taking.

""Sometimes, when you keep silent, they can execute you. Sometimes, when you speak up, they can execute you. So that is why we have to do something beyond just talking about Navid, talking about his goal. He wanted to have greater freedom. He wanted to have a better country [in which] to live.""

Iranian-American supporters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) protest the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by Iran, in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. in September 2020.

The execution ended the life of Afkari, but it has failed to silence his voice. He continues speaking from beyond the grave: ""If there's one thing I learned from stepping onto the wrestling mat,"" he was recorded saying in jail, ""it's that I should never give into oppression and lies.""

That spirit seems to be alive in his family; despite enormous pressure to comply with the government and blacken Afkari's name, they are standing firm.

""We care about the good thing that we have to do. We care about our goal, rather than think about the tortures and fear,"" said his relative, adding that Afkari's mother is torn between conflicting emotions.

""She has two feelings right now. She's so sad for losing Navid. And secondly, she's so proud of Navid because she knows that Navid chose the right path.""

Afkari has become larger in death than he ever was in life. Pashaei concludes that the campaign of which he is a spokesman is now an unstoppable force.

""They thought that by killing this guy, they can bury his name like his body. But it never happened. Now, we see that he's a champ. He's a hero for millions of young athletes. He's everywhere now.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/sport/navid-afkari-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
81,The Belgian Blueprint,"It’s one of the greatest achievements in the world of sport: just how on earth did one of the smaller countries assemble the top-ranked team in the most popular game on the planet? Belgium, a country of roughly 11 million people, wedged between France and Germany in Western Europe and dwarfed by the land mass and population size of those neighbors, first made it to the top of the FIFA rankings in 2015 and has remained firmly on the perch ever since 2018. In the next 18 months, Belgium is hoping for a major trophy to validate their dominance on the world stage, but even without a title run at the European Championship or the 2022 World Cup, their team of international superstars must still be the envy of football administrators everywhere. And the Red Devils aren’t planning on going anywhere. The journey began from the pit of despair, Belgium’s joy of co-hosting the 2000 European Championship ended in humiliation as they were bundled out in the group stage of the competition. Just nine days after thousands of white balloons had been released in celebration to kick off the tournament at the King Baudouin Stadium, the bubble had been emphatically burst inside the same arena. A sun-dappled evening in Brussels finished in the gloom of a 2-0 defeat by Turkey, two goals from Hakan Sükür -- the first of which will have given goalkeeper Filip de Wilde nightmares -- compelled senior figures in the Belgian Football Association to conduct a root and branch review of their entire football strategy.

Michel Sablon was the national team’s technical director at the time. He said the organization as tournament hosts was a “big success,” yet the performance on the field was anything but. “It was not good for the players, not good for the clubs, not good for the national team,” he told CNN. “It really was the bottom.” As it happens, Euro 2000 marked a turning point for two of the teams in action. Germany’s equally disastrous group-stage departure, featuring a rare defeat to England, prompted a thorough review of their football philosophy. It was a rebirth that would yield a World Cup victory 14 years later and Belgium was about to embark on something similar. Sablon didn’t waste much time, working to identify a new vision for football in their country. “We did it on a Saturday and Sunday, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. We started from scratch with a white piece of paper and we developed the whole thing.” Nothing was left to chance. Sablon explained how they recruited four universities to help research the workload of youth players in either five-a-side or eight-a-side games. No detail was too small; for example, was nine o’clock on a Sunday morning really the best time for the kids to play? They analyzed data from 1,500 youth games, enlisted the cooperation of 70 coaches at all levels of the game and made 120 presentations to the clubs that took almost a year. The traditional, but rigid, 4-4-2 formation was discarded in favor of a more flexible and attacking 4-3-3 line-up, which forced individual players to take more responsibility with the ball. It was an ambitious plan, but the modest size of Belgium’s football program might have been a help, rather than a hindrance. With barely two dozen professional clubs in the country, it was easier to get everybody singing from the same song sheet, and as a country without a history of major achievements, there was perhaps more freedom to try and less pressure for an immediate return on investment. Every club in the country bought into it. Inevitably, there were teething problems, but Sablon believed that if they could hold their nerve, they’d be okay. “I remember that the first game we did it with was the Under-17 team against France. We lost 7-1 and then the reaction came, of course. But a year later, in the same age category, we dominated France and beat them.” It took time, he recalled, but in hindsight the only difficult thing was deciding to embark on the journey in the first place. Around this time, budding young players like Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne were just eight, 10 and 10 years old respectively. Nobody could have possibly known it then, but they and many other players of their generation would soon be launched on a career trajectory that would change the world game.

Romelu Lukaku is one of the most powerful forwards on the planet, a deadly finisher who has just helped Inter Milan to the Serie A title in Italy. Lukaku has never been short on confidence, or the hunger and desire to succeed. It says a lot about his self-belief that he knew, as a 16-year-old, that he was good enough to play in the Belgian national team. It might also say something about the strength of the team at that time. “I knew I had the whole package,” he told CNN Sport, “I thought to myself that I was different than all the other players they had up front.” Lukaku made his international debut when he was 17 and is now his country’s record goalscorer. Back then, he was also playing with and against the future stars of the national team: “We knew that at one point, we would take over.” The Belgian team now enjoys an air of familiarity that would be the envy of many club sides -- the players go way back. Lukaku explains how he has known many of his teammates since he was 11 or 12 years old, and they have often reminisced about the old days when they’re together on international duty. “We used to sit all together at one table and debate who had the best youth team, who was scoring the most goals, the tournaments we used to attend. It was cool.”

“We know each other since a long time,” said goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, telling CNN Sport: “For example, I played against Lukaku when we were 12, 13 years old. So that's like half my lifetime. When we come together, we are a group of friends. “I remember going to our first World Cup in Brazil, people said, ‘How will the players behave after one month being together? Will there be fights? Will there be problems between them?’ And it wasn't, because we know each other very well. We are a group of friends. We go play golf together. We play cards together. We play PlayStation together.” “We know each other through and through,” says Lukaku. “It’s easier when you play in a group and you’ve known almost everybody for many, many years.” A core group of Belgium’s current squad is highly experienced; nine of them have played 80 or more games for their country, four have earned more than 100 caps and two -- Lukaku and De Bruyne -- are among the top 10 most valuable players in the world. Coach Roberto Martínez notes that it is highly unusual for any national team to have so much experience across every position. Speaking in March, he told CNN, “In the last 52 games that I’ve been in charge, we've got an average of three goals per game … there's a real continuity that you don't get in international football.”

When Belgium takes to the field in this summer’s European Championships and next year’s World Cup in Qatar, they will be living proof of the benefits of diversity and inclusiveness. At a time in world history when racism, xenophobia and intolerance are on the rise, Belgium has shown the possibilities when cultural and religious differences are embraced. “A lot of players have Congolese roots,” says Lukaku, whose father Roger played for what was then Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “Some players have Spanish or Moroccan roots. It shows it doesn’t matter what race you have, as long as you work together properly, everything can be OK.” “We are a strange country,” noted Courtois. “We have the Dutch part, the French part and the German part. Obviously, it’s not easy being one nation together, but I think Belgium has this beautiful sight.” In such a small country, three different languages might be a hindrance to progress, but in Belgium it has become a strength. Roberto Martínez has been the team’s manager since 2016 and he concurs, “I think that diversity is probably the biggest weapon that we have in our dressing room. You always get different views, different solutions. You're very aware in a young age that in life you can do things in many, many ways; that is the way that you face adversity.” Martínez is Spanish, but he understands the advantages of broadening one’s horizons at an early age. He explains how he spent most of his professional career in Britain before moving to Belgium with his Scottish wife, and he can recognize that one of Belgium’s biggest strengths is that its players have traveled the world and have then brought all that experience home. “You have to get out of your comfort zone,” says Lukaku. “The players that are here went out of their comfort zone to make a career for themselves. We left and we tested ourselves, we took a risk and that is what football has to be.”

In September 2000, just half of Belgium’s national team squad played club football outside of the Belgian domestic league. Of that squad, just four played for clubs participating in that season’s Champions League. Going into the postponed Euro 2020, the share of Belgian players abroad is a whopping 92%, with many of them playing at some of Europe’s most prestigious clubs. This past season, 12 members of Belgium’s Euro 2020 squad played for clubs that are in the Champions League.

“Fifteen, 20 years ago, there was almost no player playing outside Belgium,” observed Courtois, “Now, almost everyone is playing in one of the biggest teams in the world.” Courtois has won major trophies with both Madrid clubs (Atlético and Real) plus two Premier League titles with Chelsea in England. De Bruyne has become one of the best players in the world at Manchester City, where his trophy count has just reached double digits; Hazard has won domestic league titles in three different countries and the Europa League twice with Chelsea; Lukaku has played for Chelsea, Everton and Manchester United and is now a champion in Italy. That’s to say nothing of the exploits of defenders Toby Alderweireld (Tottenham), Jan Vertonghen (Benfica) and Thomas Meunier (Borussia Dortmund), midfielders Youri Tielemans (Leicester City) and Eden’s brother Thorgan Hazard (Dortmund) and forwards Dries Mertens (Napoli) and Michy Batshuayi, who played at Crystal Palace last season on loan from Chelsea. Belgium’s professional football pyramid, where many of these players began their careers, can only support two leagues and 26 teams, but so prodigious is their talent development that many Belgian players could walk into any team in the world and it’s the nature of their upbringing that’s helped make it possible. “When Marc Wilmots was the coach [from 2012-2016], he spoke in Dutch and partly in French,” Lukaku explains. “Now, with Roberto Martínez, everybody speaks English, but we speak to each other in French and Dutch.” “There's not a problem about learning languages at the age of four or five years old,” observes Martínez, “I see kids speaking three and four languages and it's incredible how that opens up. The Belgian wants to be of service to the group. “I would say that that's the biggest strength of the Belgian as a footballer. He will just walk into the dressing room and try to be valuable. It is not a cultural barrier.”

“I think that diversity is probably the biggest weapon that we have in our dressing room. You always get different views, different solutions. You're very aware in a young age that in life you can do things in many, many ways; that is the way that you face adversity.” Roberto Martínez, Belgium Manager

When the architects of Belgium’s new vision were laying out their plans, they knew that there would be some short-term pain. What they perhaps didn’t foresee was such a long period in the football wilderness. Between 2004 and 2007, their FIFA ranking cratered from 16th to 71st in the world, and between 2004 and 2012, they failed to qualify for any major tournament -- two World Cups and three European Championships. But the pain has been more than worth it. Martínez now boasts of having three strong players in every position and a self-sustaining model that everybody has bought into -- no less than 23 players are a third of the way through UEFA’s three-year coaching course and, at the end of their playing careers, are expected to return to work in Belgium to help develop the next generation. In the meantime, they’re happy to show the younger squad players the ropes.

The 24-year-old Tielemans, who recently scored one of the best goals ever witnessed in the FA Cup final for Leicester City, would be considered one of the younger players, but he’s already richly experienced; he made several appearances at the 2018 World Cup and is approaching 40 caps. “I’m going to have that mentality to try and win every game that I can and to pass that message onto the new guys,” he told CNN. “Passing on that message to the younger players, hopefully, we will keep the same mentality and build the success.” “There is an interest of trying to prepare the players of the future,” Martínez explained, emphasizing his optimism about the years ahead. “They care [about] educating the younger group. They are influencing Belgian football now like it's never been done. I'm sure that this generation will be in Belgian football for many years to come.” Such a collective attitude speaks to Martínez’s style of coaching, which he describes as ‘shared aspiration.’ “I've been part of groups where the leader wants to impose how to do things -- I never believed in that. The moment that person turns his back, then you lose control of what that group is working towards. “Our passion should be a very clear goal, a dream. I always believe that if we share our passion then it’s very easy to commit to the cause and give everything, not just the two hours that we are in training.”

Rise of the Red Devils: How Belgium became the number one team in the world.

While Belgium’s current success story might be unusual, they’re not the first country to experience a ‘golden generation’ of football talent. It’s a scenario that every footballing nation would strive for, but a label that presents a unique pressure to succeed with a trophy. Spain won three consecutive tournaments between 2008 and 2012 and France won the 1998 World Cup and the Euros in 2000, but Portugal’s team of Rui Costa and Luís Figo failed to deliver. The Iberian nation was able to win the Euros with Cristiano Ronaldo in 2016, but England’s ‘golden generation’ of David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen never even made it to a tournament final. In their last major tournament -- the 2018 World Cup in Russia -- Belgium was close. Against Japan in the round of 16, a thrilling last-gasp attack, involving Courtois and De Bruyne, a deceptive run from Lukaku and a sweeping finish from Nacer Chadli completed a thrilling comeback from 2-0 down. “Can you believe it?” cried one commentator. In the quarterfinals against Brazil, Lukaku was compared to “a tank’” as he dropped his shoulder and charged forward, laying the ball off to De Bruyne for a sensational and decisive goal. A series of impressive saves from Courtois carried Belgium into the semifinals, where they were stopped only by the eventual champion, France.

Still, a third-place finish (they beat England in the bronze medal match) was a magnificent achievement and Belgium’s players returned home to Brussels as conquering heroes. The scenes of them celebrating in front of a packed Grote Markt (Grand Place) in Brussels bore testimony to the joy of the moment and the diversity of the team. But next time, they want to be standing there with champions’ medals around their necks.

82,International Olympic Committee is coming under pressure over the alleged torture and arrest of Iranian athletes,"(CNN) Athletes are trained to be tough; they've learned to push through the pain barrier and find courage when all hope might seem to be lost.

But athletes in Iran have to be braver than most. For them, the battle isn't just on the field of play, it's also away from the arenas, where the consequences of their actions could be painful, even deadly.

""I am 100% fearful,"" judoka Vahid Sarlak tells CNN Sport. He knows fighting for his beliefs could end badly in a country where political activists and their families are routinely intimidated, arrested and can even be executed.

""Every day, my mom asks me not to do this, she is worried daily. But I say, 'I was born once, and I'll die once.' I have sworn that I'll fight for my freedom for as long as I'm alive.""

When asked to detail the kind of threats that she is facing, the soccer player Shiva Amini tries to make light of it, telling CNN: ""SMS messages, such as 'We will cut your head off and send a picture of it to your family.' Do you want just one example, or do you want to hear the rest?""

They used to say that sport and politics shouldn't mix, but those days seem to be a distant memory. In many parts of the western world, athletes are now using their platforms to shape social and political discourse.

In Iran, sport and politics have always mixed, but it's the theocratic government that makes the rules and enforces them through fear.

The former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei knows exactly what can be at stake; he campaigned to try and save the life of wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed in 2020.

Afkari's death became a rallying cry for athletes in Iran to unite and push for change in a campaign called 'United for Navid.'

""If we be silenced today, we don't have anything to tell our children tomorrow,"" Pashaei told CNN.

All three are now living in self-imposed exile abroad, where it's a little safer to be outspoken; all are brave, but all have been traumatized by years of harassment and intimidation.

When asked if he fears for his life, the former karate international champion Mahdi Jafargholizadeh scoffed at the suggestion: ""I died 20 years ago. I lost everything when I was in Iran. If you kill me again, you just killed a dead person.""

In 2017, soccer player Shiva Amini was forced to apply for asylum in Switzerland because she was observed playing without the compulsory hijab while outside of Iran.

An eternal blow

Sarlak might be a judoka, but he could easily have been a poet.

""Have you ever been in love?"" he asked CNN Sport. ""Sport is love,"" he opined. ""When you meet a girl for the first time, fall in love and then lose her, would it mean that you will never fall in love again? I'm sure you will, 100% sure. The next love will come.""

At the age of 40, Sarlak is still madly in love with his sport. He says a life without sport would feel ""the same as death."" But he's had his heart broken more than once and in ways that most athletes couldn't even begin to imagine.

At the age of 17, he says he was ordered to lose by his team at the World Junior Championships. Deliberately losing is an alien concept to any athlete but it's not for Iranian athletes in international competitions.

When entering a tournament, they don't fear the prospect of running into a stronger opponent, their biggest concern is that an Israeli athlete lies ahead of them in the draw because their government's unwritten rule means that they're not going to be allowed to compete against them.

Sarlak says that the first time he was told to lose in 1998, he didn't give it much thought -- he was still so young. But when it happened at the 2005 World Championships in Cairo, he was absolutely devastated.

""It was the most difficult moment of my life,"" he recalled. ""I was just crying and asking why? Why should I lose? I remember my coach slapped me and told me: 'You know that you have to go and lose the match.'""

Sarlak was fighting in the 60kg repechage and on course for a bronze medal; he'd been drawn against an opponent from Azerbaijan, but Israel's Gal Yekutiel was up next.

His coach delivered the news that no athlete would ever want to hear: ""Your next opponent will be an Israeli, and we are not permitted to be in a match with Israelis.""

Nearly 16 years after the event, Sarlak is still traumatized by it and the details of that day have been seared into his memory.

He says that the broadcast cameras were trained on him because they realized he'd thrown the match. His coach put a towel over his head and he was rushed back to the hotel, denying him the chance to watch the rest of the competition.

""I broke all the windows in my room,"" recalls Sarlak. ""It was the worst day of my life. A hole opened inside of me and that hole is still open. The dream of having that medal has remained with me. I will never forgive them.""

To add insult to injury, Sarlak says he's still taunted about it.

""Even now, when I see my Azeri opponent, he tells me, 'Your medal is on display at my house. Your medal is on my neck now. You didn't want it and I won it.' This will never be erased from my mind.""

CNN has asked the Iranian government if it acknowledges that it has prevented athletes from competing against Israelis. We also asked if they will allow their athletes to compete against Israeli opponents at the Olympics this year. They have not responded to our inquiry.

Iran's Vahid Sarlak duels with Spain's Javier Fernandez in the up to and including 60 kgs men's open category during the World Judo Championships in Cairo in September 2005. Sarlak says he was forced to default from the tournament after he'd been drawn against an opponent from Israel.

'I'm not going back'

Jafargholizadeh had always wanted to be a karate champion. He says his father was the head coach of the national team, but he didn't believe in his son.

""I remember one day I was wearing his national team jacket,"" Jafargholizadeh told CNN Sport. ""He just slapped me in the face and said, 'Who the hell are you? You get it yourself.'""

That was all the motivation that Mahdi needed. ""OK, I said, I'll show you.""

He was barely a teenager when one of the top teams in the country took an interest in him, and in time, he was competing internationally -- a national champion picking up more than 20 medals all over the world.

But Jafargholizadeh says it all came to a screeching halt when he was thrown in jail in 2004, arrested at the airport and accused of planning to be an Israeli spy. He says he was tortured and interrogated for five to six months and even threatened with the death penalty.

He relays the experience in a stream of consciousness and a smile that belies the suffering he endured.

""They break my nose, many different stuff that I don't even want to talk about.""

He says the accusations were so incredulous that he didn't take them seriously at first, but it reached a point where he couldn't take it anymore and he started goading his tormentors to go make good on their threats.

""I never forget that I had a shirt with buttons,"" he recalled, gesturing that he ripped it open and declared: ""Take your gun and shoot me here now. Or you want to hang me later on? Do it now!""

It's scarcely believable that Jafargholizadeh was eventually released from jail and able to resume his competitive career at the top level, fighting again at the 2005 and 2007 Asian championships and winning gold and silver medals with his team.

But after another brush with authority in 2008, he realized that it was no longer safe for him to remain in the country. His opposition to the government in Iran wasn't much of a secret, and he was perhaps something of a marked man.

According to Jafargholizadeh, the President of the Karate Federation, a man ""who has been in the intelligence service for years and years,"" saw him with tattoos all over his body and declared it would be his last year with the national team.

""I take my last chance; I'm not going back again. I didn't go back. I left the national team in Germany and became a refugee,"" said Jafargholizadeh.

Forced to forfeit

Many young Iranians dream of becoming professional athletes, but they can't imagine the pitfalls that will come with their exposure to the international community.

""Every Iranian has a passport,"" explains Sarlak. ""On the first page, it is written that you can travel to any country you would like to go -- except 'the occupied Palestine.'""

Sarlak says even speaking the name Israel just isn't done in Iran.

""We all know that, but the intensity of this problem is more obvious with athletes because we face situations with Israel. Ordinary people may not have to deal with it, [but] this problem is a flashpoint for athletes that will never go away.""

It's well known that athletes from Iran are prevented from competing against Israelis -- in any competition.

In the main sports where they could have met at the Olympics -- boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling -- there has never once been a contest between athletes from either country.

It almost happened at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, when a swimmer from each country was drawn to race in the fourth heat of the first round of the 100-meter breaststroke. But the Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, never showed up.

In 2017, the wrestler Alireza Mohammad Karimimachiani was in a winning position against Russia's Alikhan Zhabrailov at the Under-23 World Championship in Poland, when his coach became animated on the sideline.

He can be seen and heard on the broadcast highlights calling from the floor: ""Lose Ali!"" The clip, which can still be viewed at UWW.Org, reveals an increasingly desperate coach imploring his athlete to throw in the towel: ""Alireza! Lose Alireza! Alireza! You must lose! Alireza, you must lose! Israel won. Israel has won.""

The Israeli Uri Kalashnikov had just beaten the American Samuel Brooks and was awaiting the winner in the next round. It was the second time in his career that Karimimachiani says he had been told to lose, later he told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency that ""my whole world seemed to come to an end.""

Iran's Saeid Mollaei (in white) fights against Belgium's Matthias Casse during the semifinal of the men's under 81kg category during the 2019 Judo World Championships at the Nippon Budokan, a venue for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Mollaei, who claimed he was ordered to deliberately lose a world championship fight, could compete under a refugee flag at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, officials said on September 1.

A much clearer instruction can be heard in an audio recording made at the 2019 World Judo Championships in Tokyo, when Saeid Mollaei was ordered to lose his semifinal in order to steer clear of the Israeli world champion Sagi Muki.

""Based on my stance, that of the regime and that of the minister, he has no right to compete,"" says the president of Iran's Judo Federation in the recording.

The ambient noise of the competition is audible in the background as he concludes with a scarcely veiled threat: ""The circumstances stipulate that one should never question this stance. Make him understand that he has no right to compete under no circumstances. He is responsible for his actions.""

Sarlak now lives in Germany; he breaks down in tears and leaves the interview when explaining that he hasn't been able to see his parents for 12 years. Jafargholizadeh resides in the mountains of Finland and the 1998 junior world Greco-Roman wrestling champion Pashaei is exiled in the US.

He fled in 2008, when it became apparent that his Kurdish ethnicity and the connection to his politically active father was shutting down career opportunities.

As a coach, he says he was barred from traveling out of the country with the national team.

A year before he made the decision to flee the country, he witnessed one of his wrestlers being denied the chance to fight; he told CNN that he watched from a distance as Babak Ghorbani was given the news.

""He was sitting on the stage in the stadium and he couldn't believe it. He was crying and crying. He was telling me, 'You know how hard I worked! I don't deserve this!'

""This is not just about losing one match, it affects your whole life. Your dignity has been taken away by other people, people who are usually members of the intelligence service who don't know the pain of being an athlete. This is sport, it has to be about peace and friendship, but they teach you to hate.""

'Girls had no value'

Many countries would be delighted to see their athletes and teams triumph on the world stage.

In the purest sense, sporting success can be a boost to domestic morale, but it can also be used as a means of wielding soft power on the international stage. Sport is a good way to make friends and influence people -- and so they're willing to make heavy investments or even cheat to achieve those ends.

Iranian athletes have come to realize, though, that the opposite is true for them. Iran seems to routinely sabotage its own sporting success and its female athletes are in no doubt about that.

They often feel as though they have to compete with one hand tied behind their backs -- that's if they're allowed to compete at all.

Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran hasn't sent a female athlete to compete at the Olympics in swimming, wrestling or gymnastics, none of which would be possible while wearing the compulsory hijab

Shiva Amini says her proudest achievement with the national women's soccer team was at the 2009 Indoor Asian Games in Vietnam, where her Futsal team beat Uzbekistan and Japan to win their group, before losing to Jordan in the semifinals.

""With all the difficulties of wearing a hijab, in the heat in Vietnam, we were able to win,"" she explained to CNN. ""Despite all the difficulties, because of the love we have for football and sport, we could fight and be just like any other girls.""

Amini details the inconvenience of competing in a hijab, how it restricts the ability to move and how it becomes heavy with sweat: ""We had a hard time even breathing.""

And if the scarf became loose or if the sleeves rolled up their arms, the referee would blow the whistle to stop the game and a scoring opportunity might have been lost.

Amini, who was regarded as the most technically gifted player in the women's game in Iran, says that she and the female team were made to feel as if their status was little more than token.

""I started to realize that I am in a society that they fundamentally do not want a girl to advance,"" she said, outlining the experience of sharing a national training camp with the men's team and being told to remain on the sidelines.

""I asked the head of the federation why you aren't giving us the facilities and he responded by saying, 'The team only exists so that FIFA [football's world governing body] wouldn't eliminate the boys team according to their regulations.' I realized that us girls had no value. It was an insult and a humiliation.""

In 2017, Amini was playing football in Switzerland and she posted pictures of it on her social media accounts.

Given that she wasn't on official business with the country of Iran, she didn't give it a second thought, until the pictures appeared everywhere back home and caused a storm of controversy: she wasn't wearing her hijab and she was playing with ""anti-Islam"" teams.

""For a few weeks, the entire internet was filled with stories about me,"" Amini told CNN. ""It created a very bad situation for my family in Iran and myself in Switzerland.""

She hired lawyers in both countries, but soon came to realize that the situation was now beyond her control.

""They have fully politicized this event and put your name on a blacklist in Iran,"" she said she was told. ""I was not prepared to deal with what was about to happen, my life was about to fully change in all aspects, I did not have a good mental condition.""

Amini has not been home since and says both she and her family are routinely harassed and intimidated.

Campaigning for justice

In September 2020, a dreadful event motivated these four athletes and many others to come together and tell their stories.

The execution of wrestler Afkari -- capital punishment for a murder that his family and friends say that he did not commit -- galvanized the sports community and spurred it into action.

Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee and the Executive Board at the IOC, calling for immediate action to be taken against the National Olympic Committee of Iran.

In letters sent on March 5, March 25 and April 19, United for Navid has provided the names and case studies of 20 athletes who've been negatively impacted by political interference in Iran.

""We have a simple question,"" states the United for Navid campaign spokesman Pashaei: ""Can IOC member states torture and arrest athletes and violate the [Olympic] charter? Are you doing anything to protect these athletes? Because their rights are being discriminated against every single day.""

IOC President Thomas Bach speaks during a press conference in Tokyo on November 16, 2020. Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Bach, calling for immediate action to be taken against the NOC of Iran.

According to the charter's Fundamental Principles of Olympism, ""the practice of sport is a human right"" and ""sports organizations within the Olympic Movement shall apply political neutrality.""

Access to sport should be enjoyed without ""discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.""

The charter concludes: ""Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter.""

In an impassioned plea, the emotion is clear in Pashaei's voice as he continues listing to CNN the many ways in which the integrity and safety of Iranian athletes is compromised by their own government.

""When they don't compete with Israeli athletes, they tell the IOC that this is their personal decision. It's a big lie. Every single trip, there are members of security intelligence watching the athletes 24/7 and if they do something wrong, they have been punished.

""I want to ask IOC, are you aware of this? You talk about gender equality and race equality. Are you aware that one of your members is violating the charter all the time? You have been silent about this; we're not going to be silenced.""

A picture taken on March 8, 2021 in Lausanne shows the Olympic rings next to the headquarters of the IOC.

Of the 20 case studies that have been sent to the IOC so far, only 12 athletes have been identified. The names of eight others have been withheld to protect them, as they are still living in Iran.

Amini says those athletes fully support the campaign. ""They are very happy with this movement. They encourage us, they push us forward. And the one thing they all say is, 'All of our hopes are in you guys,'"" Amini told CNN.

There is an element of risk, also, for the athletes living outside of Iran -- many of them still have family at home.

""Once in a while they question our parents, brothers and sisters, they threaten them,"" says Pashaei. ""But our families, all of them, believe that we're doing the right thing.""

So far, the IOC's only response has been a tacit acknowledgment that they have received the documentation from the campaign.

In a March press conference, spokesman Mark Adams said: ""I don't know to be honest, I think -- I believe -- we have. And as with all communications, it will be dealt with in due course, but it wasn't discussed at the Executive Board today. But trust us, it will be dealt with.""

Former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei says there's ""an element of risk"" for athletes outside the country to campaign against Iran's NOC.

United for Navid is optimistic that the IOC will, ultimately, take action.

Earlier this year, their pressure campaign led to the International Judo Federation banning the Iran team for four years, but they're hoping that the action can be urgent.

In the letter dated March 25, Pashaei concludes with the line, ""We look forward to your timely response. Every day that passes without action results in more athlete mistreatment.""

Pashaei says there is evidence to suggest that the current head of Iran's Olympic Committee used to be a top-ranking member of Iran's intelligence agency, as detailed in a 2018 report from VOA/Radio Farda: ""He was involved in arresting and torturing people. He is going to the Olympic Games.""

""Even a little change will make a big difference,"" concludes Jafargholizadeh. He and the other campaigners are confident that action from arguably the biggest governing body in world sport would force Iran to take politics out of sport and treat the athletes better.

But it might take an Olympic ban to do it.

""A lot of people think we are against sport in Iran,"" he said, disputing that fact. ""They have to know we have been athletes. We have been part of that national team for years and years. We just want to say, 'Stop torturing people and killing them.'""

""It's about our dignity,"" says Pashaei. ""We're not going to give up. We're going to go to the end.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/01/sport/iranian-athletes-ioc-campaign-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
83,"Bundesliga: Targeted by far right group, Türkgücü Munich, founded by Turkish immigrants, looks to connect cultures","He came to Germany from Togo in 1995. Initially, he says, integration proved challenging -- ""we didn't have a lot of interaction with people"" -- but playing football provided a place where he could be himself.

""It was the first time where I had a smile on my face,"" adds Zinsou. ""You are working hard everywhere to be part of society, but on the pitch, was always the moment where the language didn't play any role.""

Zinsou is speaking to CNN Sport from his home in Munich. He talks proudly of doing well at school, being married to his German wife and father to two children. ""Society ... gave me opportunities,"" he says.

Football still plays an important part in Zinsou's life -- he's Youth Coordinator for German football club Türkgücü Munich.

""My mission in life is teaching football,"" says Zinsou as he reflects on his role of overseeing Türkgücü's various youth teams. He sees that mission as not just developing talented footballers, but also teaching them valuable life skills.

Türkgücü Munich is making waves in Germany both on the sporting and political scene

A club for all

""Preserving traditions, connecting cultures,"" is Türkgücü's motto.

The club's crest is a mix of the Turkish and Bavarian flags and is an ode to the club's founding fathers -- Turkish immigrants, for whom Bavaria was home, and who established Türkgücü in 1975.

""I feel German, but I also love my Turkish roots,"" Ünal Tosun, one of Türkgücü's leading player, tells CNN Sport.

The world's largest Turkish diaspora can be found in Germany and Tosun, who is the son of Turkish immigrants, is a physical embodiment of Türkgücü's past, present and future.

""We have over three million Turkish people in Germany ... and they can also identify with me. We are an idol club for many immigrant clubs,"" the sharply trimmed midfielder Tosun says.

Beaming with pride as he describes playing for Türkgücü in his hometown of Munich, Tosun recounts receiving messages on Instagram from supporters in Turkey who he says ""look up to us.""

""We're not the typical local club,"" adds Türkgücü CEO Max Kothny. ""If I look in the stands, there's so many people from so many cultures that it perfectly shows how the German culture is.""

The club's logo is half-half of the Turkish and Bavarian flags

'The higher you go, the harder it gets'

Türkgücü's increased prominence -- both on and off the pitch -- owes itself, in part, to its rapid rise through the German football league structure.

Once an amateur team, Türkgücü now plays in the 3. Liga -- Germany's third division, which like the country's top two leagues is fully professional.

Remarkably Türkgücü now stands just two promotions away from Germany's elite league -- the Bundesliga. According to Der Spiegel in March 2020, the club's budget was $2 million. Türkgücü wouldn't confirm that figure, but did say it's ""in the lower half in the table regarding the budgets in 3. Liga.""

""The higher you go, the harder it gets,"" Kothny says with a wry smile.

Financial backing for the team has been largely provided by Hasan Kivran, a Turkish-born German, who previously played for the club, but is now a successful business entrepreneur and Türkgücü's president. Türkgücü wouldn't disclose how much Kivran has invested in the club.

""Being ambitious is not something bad -- it's something good,"" says Zinsou. ""Following your goals is something good. Taking smart decisions to reach this goal is something good. Working with passion is something good.""

Kivran intimated he was going to step down in late 2020, but then had a rethink.

""The main reasons that I changed my mind were those in charge of the company, a high level of fan support over the past two weeks and the prospect of a young talent center in southeast Munich,"" said Kivran in an interview with SPORT1 earlier this year.

Croatian striker Petar Sliskovic is one of a number of new arrivals at the club

Munich's second team?

Türkgücü is currently ninth in Germany's 3. Liga with 40 points, 18 behind leader Dynamo Dresden.

Germany's third division contains a number of clubs -- such as 1. FC Kaiserslautern and TSV 1860 München --- that have previously played in the Bundesliga.

That Türkgücü now plays against such clubs -- 1. FC Kaiserslautern is a four-time winner of the German top-flight league -- is testament to its rise through the German football ladder and its growing prominence.

""We've been working here since the sixth division, which is absolutely incredible!"" Kothny says speaking to CNN Sport from a 15 square meter wooden portacabin that acts as the club's offices.

""This is a total start-up mentality,"" he adds.

Kothny says plans are afoot to build the club's own academy and training facilities, but for now this football start-up is currently without a stadium to call home.

'Home' matches are divided between the Grünwalder and the iconic Munich Olympic Stadium, one of the venues for the 1972 Olympic Games.

Playing at the Olympic Stadium -- Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich's former home before the club moved to the Allianz Arena -- Kothny and Tosun say they have to pinch themselves at times to remember the journey they've been on.

""Now we're playing in an arena which has 60,000 seats -- it's brilliant!"" Kothny exclaims.

""There are so many good players who played there. They are so many important matches played there -- It's an honor,"" Tosun says.

Türkgücü are playing some of their home matches this season at the iconic Olympic Stadium, venue of the 1972 Munich Olympics

Remodel and rebuild

Perhaps what's surprising is not just that Kothny is spearheading operations from relatively modest surroundings but that he's doing so at the age of 24.

""I think the future is on the young guns so I'm using it as an advantage,"" smiles Kothny.

""My way of thinking is a little bit different to the rest of this business, which is pretty much the same for the last like 20 years,"" adds Kothny, explaining how each season ""we lose 80% of the roster"" to ensure Türkgücü is competitive, given each promotion means the club will play against better teams.

Tosun joined the club in 2018, yet he's its longest-serving player and one of the few Turkish-German players left in the squad.

""We need to keep that factor in the history, in the portfolio of the club,"" says Zinsou.

""I mean, if there were somewhere a Togolese team playing in a high level, I would be very interested in joining them as well,' Zinsou says jokingly.

""Bavarian nowadays doesn't only mean that you have a German name [...] because the culture in Munich is mixed and it is rich.

""Our main focus is clearly on the quality of the players with the target to bring them to the first team,"" added Zinsou.

Over the last few years there has been a huge turnover of players with the aim of achieving direct promotion to 3. Liga, which signals thet scale of Türkgücü's ambition.

""That brought a lot of criticism also on us but this is how it worked. And I think the success proves that that this was the right way,"" says Kothny.

Turkish-born German Ünal Tosun is Türkgücü's longest-serving player

Fighting fear through football

Nonetheless Türkgücü's ascent and the club's strong Turkish associations have drawn plenty of attention.

Inspiring and imaginative to some; divisive and disruptive to others, the club has become a target of some far-right groups in Germany.

The extreme-right Der III. Weg -- The Third Way -- party, has been vocal about Türkgücü.

According to the German Interior Ministry, the ""ideological statements of the party ""The III. Way"" are shaped from historical National Socialism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia.""

The far-right group's website in October showed a photo of two men, one holding The Third Way flag, displaying a ""Türkgücü is not welcome"" banner outside Zwickau's stadium.

Underneath the photo was the statement, ""Whether in Zwickau, Magdeburg or anywhere else: a Turkish team has no place in German football. The message is clear in Magdeburg and among fans of the FCM: Türkgücü is not welcome.""

""We were unfortunately already prepared as far as we knew that things like that might happen,"" Kothny says. ""Sometimes it is a burden to have the Turkish flag in your logo.

""A lot of [users on] social media are saying go back to Turkey or play in the Super Lig, but they are not realizing the background,"" adds Kothny, referring to the Turkish top-flight soccer division.

He also recounts how small groups of far-right supporters gathered ahead of the away game against FSV Zwickau in October in Saxony.

And when Türkgücü played 1. FC Kaiserslautern in January, racist and xenophobic stickers and flyers were put up in the vicinity of the Fritz Walter Stadium.

The club's recent rapid rise has seen it targeted by far-right supporters

Both FSV Zwickau and 1. FC Kaiserslautern took to social media to stand in solidarity with Türkgücü.

And Rainer Keßler, chairman of the supervisory board of 1. FC Kaiserslautern, said in a statement: ""It is intolerable that right-wing groups try to misuse 1. FC Kaiserslautern's name, history, values and the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in the defense of inhuman slogans and ideologies. The FCK family stands for a multicultural society and expressly distances itself from nationalist ideas.""

Meanwhile, in another game against SV Waldhof Mannheim in April 2020, Türkgücü player Yi-Young Park reportedly told the referee that he had been repeatedly racially insulted from the spectator area.

Mannheim was subsequently fined $2,900 by the German Football Association (DFB) for the behavior of its fans.

Kothny admits that messages at those games are ""not the most brutal thing that I've read on a banner. We get letters from people all around Germany here to our post box. We get emails which are brutal, which is really like far right things against the club.""

Despite the wider political landscape, Kothny says he is adamant that the club has to maintain its neutrality.

""We try not to give those people a platform [...] because then they get exactly what they want and this is awareness.

""We try to always give the answer on the pitch because this is what counts in sports. As soon as we move in one political direction, this will not turn out well for us.""

Integration

The philosophy of Türkgücü's youth setup -- the club has five youth teams, which Zinsou oversees, emphasizes the teaching of life as much as soccer skills.

""This is a package for life, it's not only for football,"" says Zinsou, as he talks about Türkgücü's various youth teams.

""When you talk about integration, it's always on both parts. I need to go one step further and people will do a step in my direction so that we meet somewhere in the middle.""

That message is one shared by Claudemir Jeronimo Barreto, known as Cacau, the Brazil-born former Germany international who played for Türkgücu, and was integration officer for the DFB until January.

While working for the DFB, Cacau was active in supporting the organization's work with refugees. According to the DFB, a scheme the association set up enabled 60,000 refugees to play football competitively in German.

In the summer of 2019, Cacau also traveled to Ostritz at the invitation of the local football club and worked alongside Michael Kretschmer -- Minister-President of the Free State of Saxony -- against a right-wing extremist rally

Tosun is hoping that he too can deliver a lasting legacy for generations to come.

""I want to be a role model with my mentality. I want to be a role model for younger players and want to help [them] achieve the same goal that I achieve,"" as he reflected on his career and the example he wants to set.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/01/football/trkgc-munich-football-turkey-germany-immigrant-far-right-cmd-spt-intl/index.html

Zhao is of Han decent, the dominant ethnicity in China.

Much of the world's attention was on the Beijing National Stadium on Friday as the venue hosted the opening ceremony for the 2022 Winter Olympics.

The stadium, commonly referred to as the Bird's Nest because of its design, also hosted the opening ceremony for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Beijing is the first city in history to host both a Summer and a Winter Olympics.

Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the ceremony, and he was joined by many international dignitaries. But notably absent were leaders of major democratic powers, as Great Britain, Australia and Canada are among those to join a US-led diplomatic boycott of these Games, citing Beijing's human-rights record.

This is the second Olympics to be held during the coronavirus pandemic. As with last year's Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a raft of Covid-19 countermeasures have been put in place and the Games will be held inside what authorities have called a ""closed loop system"" — a bubble completely cut off from the rest of the city. Tickets for the Games will not be sold to the general public; they will be distributed by authorities instead.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/sport/gallery/opening-ceremony-beijing-winter-olympics/index.html

Carlo Fumagalli/AP Diego Maradona is carried around the field after leading Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup final. Argentina defeated West Germany at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.

Diego Maradona, a colorful and beloved soccer icon regarded as one of the greatest ever to play the game, has died aged 60 after suffering heart failure, a source from the Argentinian Justice Ministry told CNN en Español on Wednesday.

Maradona is best known for captaining Argentina to victory at the 1986 World Cup, where he was named the tournament's best player and scored two of its most famous goals. In his professional career, he was twice sold for a world-record transfer fee: to Barcelona in 1982 and then to Napoli in 1984. He played 188 games with Napoli, winning two Serie A titles and a UEFA Cup for the Italian club.

Following a failed drug test in 1991 and a 15-month ban from the sport, Maradona's playing career fizzled out. He would later turn to management.

In 2008, Maradona became Argentina's manager and led the team at the 2010 World Cup, where it was eliminated in the quarterfinals. He held various managerial jobs over the past decade, including stints in Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. At the time of his death, he was in charge of Gimnasia y Esgrima, a club in Argentina's first division.

Earlier this month, Maradona underwent successful surgery for a subdural hematoma — more commonly known as a blood clot on the brain.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/football/gallery/diego-maradona/index.html

David J. Phillip/AP Los Angeles Dodgers celebrate after defeating the Tampa Bay Rays 3-1 to win the baseball World Series in Game 6 on Tuesday, October 27, in Arlington, Texas.

The Los Angeles Dodgers closed out an unprecedented World Series with a 3-1 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas, on Tuesday.

The Dodgers and the Rays faced off during the coronavirus pandemic, making it a Fall Classic the likes of which we have never seen.

A limited number of fans were allowed to attend, and it was the first time the best-of-seven series was played on a neutral site -- the newly opened Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.

This was the 20th World Series appearance for the Dodgers, who competed for the title in three of the last four years. The team won six times, but not since 1988.

It was just the second time the Rays made it to the World Series, which they won in 2008.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/21/us/gallery/world-series-2020/index.html

Mark J. Terrill/AP Members of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat kneel during the National Anthem before Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, September 30.

Since the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who was killed in police custody in May, many athletes and sports leagues have been throwing their support behind the protest movement calling for change.

The NFL was the latest league to make a statement, starting its 2020 season with messages in the end zones that said ""End Racism"" and ""It Takes All of Us."" In each Week 1 contest, there was also a pregame playing of the hymn ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" which is known as the Black National Anthem.

In some stadiums, teams gathered together on the field to lock arms in a pregame ""moment of unity."" A few players across the league took a knee or raised a fist during the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

The NBA's Milwaukee Bucks made headlines in August when they decided to boycott a playoff game against the Orlando Magic. The Bucks were responding to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, which happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin, about 40 miles from Milwaukee.

The NBA went on to postpone all three of its playoff games that day, and other leagues followed suit: the WNBA, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer all called off games. The NBA and the WNBA also postponed their games the next day, as did the NHL and some baseball teams.

Since the NBA restarted its season, the words ""Black Lives Matter"" have been prominently displayed on its court and players have been sporting social-justice messages on the backs of their jerseys. But they aren't the only athletes who have been taking a stand.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/world/gallery/sports-protests/index.html

Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images Michael Jordan rises for a dunk in March 1993. A new documentary, ""The Last Dance,"" focuses on the basketball legend and his final season with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan played 15 NBA seasons, winning six titles and five league MVPs. Many consider him the greatest player ever.

In the late 20th century, Michael Jordan was more than just the best basketball player in the world.

He was a global phenomenon.

Jordan won it all during his playing career — six NBA championships, two Olympic gold medals and an NCAA title. He mesmerized fans with his gravity-defying dunks, his fierce competitiveness and an uncanny ability to deliver in the final moments of a game.

And he dominated off the court as well.

His Air Jordan sneakers revolutionized the industry and continue to sell out today. Gatorade commercials encouraged kids to ""be like Mike."" He even starred in a movie with Bugs Bunny.

(CNN Español) -- Los combatientes ucranianos esperan evacuar a los 100 adultos y 20 niños que siguen atrapados en la planta siderúrgica de Azovstal, ubicada cerca de la ciudad de Mariúpol, en el sur de Ucrania.

En una entrevista con Reuters este lunes, el subcomandante del regimiento de Azov, Sviataslav Palamar, describió sus sentimientos encontrados cuando civiles fueron evacuados de forma segura de la acería el domingo, tras semanas atrapados allí.

Palamar dijo que sintió “alegría entre lágrimas” al ver a los civiles salir de la acería, y destacó que mientras estuvieron atrapados “miles de personas murieron”.

“Espero que haya otras evacuaciones y que puedan sacar a los civiles que todavía están aquí en esta planta. Estamos hablando de 20 niños. Eso es lo que hemos contado, y 100 civiles, mujeres, ancianos”, dijo Palamar.

Las autoridades ucranianas tenían planes para rescatar a las personas atrapadas bajo los escombros este lunes, pero no pudieron hacerlo debido al fuego de artillería continuo de los soldados rusos, dijo Palamar.

Aquí hay más de los últimos titulares de la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania:

Planta de acero de Azovstal bajo ""fuego constante"" el lunes, dijo un policía:

Un comandante entre los soldados ucranianos en la planta de acero sitiada de Azovstal dice que el complejo estuvo bajo ""fuego constante"" desde la madrugada de este lunes. Mykhailo Vershynin, jefe de la Policía de Patrulla de Mariúpol, dijo a CNN que “después de que se fue la misión de la Cruz Roja, hemos estado bajo fuego constante desde la madrugada. La artillería y la artillería naval disparan sin pausa. Los ataques aéreos caen constantemente”. El domingo evacuaron a unos 100 civiles de la planta, pero no otra evacuación planificada para este lunes no se concretó.

Habrá evacuaciones civiles de Mariúpol el martes, dice el ayuntamiento:

Habrá una evacuación civil el martes en Mariupol, según el canal de Telegram del ayuntamiento. El acuerdo, según el Ayuntamiento de Mariúpol, se acordó oficialmente con la asistencia de las Naciones Unidas y la Cruz Roja. Aunque evacuará a los ciudadanos de Mariúpol, el convoy partirá de una rotonda cerca de Berdiansk, una ciudad ocupada por Rusia al oeste de Mariúpol, a las 7 A.M. hora local.

5 rusos murieron en la planta siderúrgica Azovstal de Mariúpol, dicen soldados ucranianos:

El Regimiento Azov, cuyos soldados aun resisten a las fuerzas rusas en la planta siderúrgica Azovstal en Mariupol, dice que cinco soldados rusos murieron este lunes por la noche durante un intento de asalto a la planta. ""Después de la evacuación parcial de civiles del territorio de Azovstal en Mariúpol, el enemigo sigue disparando en la superficie de la planta, incluidos los edificios donde los civiles se esconden del peligro, y llevan a cabo ataques aéreos, disparos con artillería naval y tanques"". afirmó en su canal de Telegram, y agregó que cinco ""ocupantes enemigos fueron destruidos"" durante un asalto al complejo.

EE.UU. acoge con satisfacción los informes de que algunos civiles pudieron evacuar Mariúpol:

Estados Unidos acoge con satisfacción los informes de que ""algunos civiles pudieron evacuar Mariúpol"" y alienta los ""esfuerzos continuos"" para permitir que los civiles abandonen la ciudad portuaria del sur y otras ciudades sitiadas. El portavoz del Departamento de Estado, Ned Price, dijo este lunes: ""Queremos asegurarnos de que el acceso humanitario limitado que hemos visto en las últimas horas no sea fugaz. Hacerlo demostraría que puede haber una intención humanitaria genuina detrás de esta evacuación y no solo otro cobarde intento por parte del Kremlin de cambiar la narrativa, para lograr una victoria de relaciones públicas”, dijo Price durante una conferencia informativa del Departamento de Estado.

Por ahora no hay planes para que Biden viaje a Ucrania, dice la Casa Blanca:

Actualmente no hay planes para que el presidente de Estados Unidos Joe Biden viaje a Ucrania, a pesar de los viajes a la región del secretario de Estado, Antony Blinken, el secretario de Defensa, Lloyd Austin, y la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, en las últimas semanas, dijo la Casa Blanca a CNN este lunes. “Bueno, no hay planes en curso en este momento y, obviamente, continuaremos evaluando”, dijo la secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Jen Psaki, a Kaitlan Collins de CNN en la rueda de prensa de la Casa Blanca de este lunes. “Y como saben, nuestro objetivo es reabrir la embajada, tener a nuestros diplomáticos allí, no solo viajando de un lado a otro, sino presentes en el país, y sé que al presidente le encantaría visitar Ucrania, pero no, no hay planes en curso en este momento”. Antes del ""Día de la Victoria"" de Rusia, un feriado relevante que marca la rendición nazi en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Psaki insinuó que Estados Unidos tendría más para transmitir y ""marcar nuestro apoyo a los ucranianos y los europeos de alguna manera"" en los próximos días. Ella se negó a dar detalles. Los funcionarios le dijeron a CNN que el presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin, quiere poder celebrar una victoria, de algún tipo, en su guerra ese día.

La inteligencia de EE. UU. informa que Rusia intentará anexar las regiones de Donetsk y Luhansk para ""mediados de mayo"", dice el embajador:

Estados Unidos tiene informes de inteligencia ""altamente creíbles"" de que Rusia intentará anexar las regiones ocupadas por los separatistas de Donetsk y Luhansk ""en algún momento en mediados de mayo”, y que hay planes para crear una llamada “república popular” similar en Jersón para ser anexada también, dijo el embajador de Estados Unidos ante la Organización para la Seguridad y la Cooperación en Europa. “Los informes indican que Rusia tiene planes de montar referéndums para unirse a Rusia en algún momento a mediados de mayo, y que Moscú está considerando un plan similar para Jersón”, dijo el embajador Michael Carpenter en una rueda de prensa en el Departamento de Estado.

Víctimas de un ataque con misiles contra Odesa:

Este lunes dispararon un misil contra ""una de las instalaciones de infraestructura de Odesa"", dijo Maksym Marchenko, jefe de la administración militar de la región de Odesa. ""Lamentablemente hay muertos y heridos"", dijo. Por su parte, el Comando Sur del Ejército ucraniano informó: ""Otro ataque con misiles en la región de Odesa. Hubo impactos en la infraestructura de la ciudad. En particular, un edificio religioso resultó dañado. Se está esclareciendo la información sobre las víctimas"". Un periodista en Odesa le dijo a CNN que una iglesia ortodoxa había sido atacada cerca del aeropuerto civil.

Ucrania afirma tener más éxito en la toma de territorio alrededor de Járkiv:

Los militares ucranianos confirmaron que sus fuerzas recuperaron el control de varios asentamientos al norte y al este de Járkiv, lo que podría dificultar que los rusos lancen misiles y ataques de artillería contra el noreste de la ciudad. Ruska Lozova, un pueblo al norte de Járkiv, ""volvió a nuestro control a pesar de las dificultades y las pérdidas"", dijeron las fuerzas armadas el lunes. Los militares también dijeron que la aldea de Verkhnya Rohanka en el este de Járkiv estaba nuevamente en manos ucranianas y que la operación había sido dirigida por el coronel general Oleksandr Syrsky, comandante de las fuerzas terrestres. En las últimas dos semanas, Ucrania ha reclamado alrededor de media docena de aldeas en el área, acercando un poco sus fuerzas a las líneas rusas de suministro que van desde la frontera hasta Izium.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/guerra-rusia-ucrania-hoy-ultima-hora-noticias-orix-51/

El proyecto está ahora a cargo de Orbital Assembly Corporation, una empresa de construcción espacial que cortó lazos con Gateway.

El plan de Orbital Assembly es lanzar no una, sino dos estaciones espaciales con alojamiento para turistas: la estación Voyager, el diseño original rebautizado, ahora tendrá capacidad para alojar a 400 personas en su lanzamiento en 2027, mientras que el nuevo concepto para la estación Pioneer albergará a 28 personas, podría estar en funcionamiento en apenas tres años.

El objetivo, según Orbital Assembly, es gestionar un ""parque industrial"" espacial que cuente con oficinas y alojamiento para turistas.

El turismo espacial parece estar más cerca que nunca: el año pasado, el multimillonario fundador de Virgin, Richard Branson, se lanzó al espacio suborbital con su empresa Virgin Galactic, mientras que el actor de Star Trek, William Shatner, se convirtió en la persona de mayor edad en el espacio gracias a una excursión con Blue Origin.

Pero los viajes espaciales siguen teniendo un costo impactante, lo que hace que a muchos nos cueste si quiera pensar en pasar nuestras vacaciones fuera de este mundo.

Tim Alatorre, director de operaciones de Orbital Assembly, cree que esta barrera desaparecerá una vez que gane tracción el turismo espacial.

""El objetivo siempre ha sido posibilitar que un gran número de personas vivan, trabajen y prosperen en el espacio"", dijo Alatorre a CNN Travel en una nueva entrevista.

Un hogar lejos de casa

Alatorre dice que el atractivo del nuevo concepto de Estación Pioneer es que su escala más pequeña hace que se pueda realizar antes.

""Nos va a dar la oportunidad de que la gente empiece a experimentar el espacio a mayor escala, más rápidamente"", dijo.

Tanto en la Estación Pioneer como en la Estación Voyager también se podrán alquilar oficinas e instalaciones de investigación.

Según Alatorre, Orbital Assembly sale ganando, ya que muchos de sus objetivos a corto plazo dependen de la financiación.

Orbital Assembly prevé que ambas estaciones funcionen como una rueda giratoria que orbita alrededor de la Tierra.

En una entrevista de 2019 con CNN Travel, Alatorre explicó que la física de la estación Voyager funciona como una cubeta de agua que gira.

""La estación gira, empujando el contenido de la estación hacia los extremos, de forma muy parecida a como se puede hacer girar una cubeta de agua: el agua empuja hacia dentro y se queda en su sitio"", dijo.

Cerca del centro de la estación no habría gravedad artificial, pero a medida que se desciende hacia el exterior de la estación, la sensación de gravedad aumentará.

En principio su idea no ha cambiado, dijo Alatorre más recientemente. Pero, explicó, como la estación Pioneer será más pequeña, su nivel de gravedad será diferente. Seguirá habiendo lo que él llama las ""comodidades"" de la gravedad artificial, como las duchas, la posibilidad de comer y beber sentado... pero los espacios con menos gravedad permitirán disfrutar aún más de las excentricidades espaciales.

Las imágenes de los interiores de ambas estaciones sugieren un diseño interior similar al de un hotel de lujo en la Tierra, pero con unas vistas fuera de este mundo.

Alatorre, que tiene formación en arquitectura, dijo anteriormente que la estética del hotel era una respuesta directa a la película de Stanley Kubrick ""2001: A Space Oddisey"", que él calificó de ""casi un modelo de lo que no se debe hacer"".

""Creo que el objetivo de Stanley Kubrick era resaltar la división entre la tecnología y la humanidad y por eso, a propósito, hizo las estaciones y las naves muy estériles y limpias y alienígenas"".

El nombre original del hotel espacial, Estación Von Braun, se eligió porque el concepto se inspiró en los diseños de hace 60 años de Wernher von Braun, un ingeniero aeroespacial que fue pionero en la tecnología de cohetes, primero en Alemania y después en Estados Unidos.

Mientras vivía en Alemania, von Braun participó en el programa nazi de desarrollo de cohetes, por lo que dar su nombre al hotel espacial era una elección controvertida.

""La estación no tiene nada que ver con él. Está basada en su diseño, y nos gustan sus contribuciones a la ciencia y el espacio"", dijo el antiguo CEO de Orbital Assembly, John Blincow, que ya no está asociado a la empresa, en una entrevista con CNN Travel en 2021. ""Pero la Estación Voyager es mucho más que eso. Es el material del futuro. Y queremos un nombre que no tenga esas connotaciones"".

""No solo para los ricos""

Las visitas al espacio se han hecho más habituales en el último año, gracias a los viajes organizados por Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin y la empresa de Elon Musk, SpaceX.

Alatorre dijo que su equipo ha ""hablado con casi todo el mundo"" en la industria espacial sobre la colaboración.

""Pero lo único que les falta a todas estas empresas es el destino, ¿no?"", dijo Alatorre. ""Es algo así como si quieres ir a ver el Gran Cañón y lo ves de pasada y vuelves a casa"".

La Estación Espacial Internacional ha hospedado a turistas en el pasado, incluido el primer turista espacial del mundo, Dennis Tito, en 2001. Pero Alatorre sugiere que la EEI es principalmente un lugar de trabajo e investigación, y el hotel espacial de Orbital Assembly sirve a un nicho diferente.

""No va a ser como si fueras a una fábrica o a un centro de investigación"", dijo. En cambio, debe sentirse como un ""sueño de ciencia ficción"".

""No hay cables por todas partes, es un espacio cómodo donde te sientes como en casa"", añadió.

A medida que los multimillonarios inyectan dinero en el espacio, también crece la reacción contra el turismo espacial, ya que muchos sugieren que el dinero podría gastarse mejor en la Tierra.

En respuesta a esta crítica, Alatorre sugirió que ""muchas tecnologías que cambian la vida"" provienen de la exploración espacial, como el GPS.

Alatorre también planteó que vivir en el espacio implicará crear ""sociedades sostenibles"".

""Este tipo de sistemas cerrados van a cambiar la cultura, la forma en que la gente piensa en la utilización de los recursos"", dijo.

""Nuestro entorno no es solo la Tierra, es todo el sistema solar. Y hay tantos recursos ahí fuera, que cuando empecemos a utilizarlos y capitalizarlos, eso va a cambiar y mejorar el nivel de vida aquí en la Tierra"".

A pesar de que en estos momentos el costo de un viaje al espacio es elevado, según Alatorre, el turismo espacial no será solo para multimillonarios.

""Estamos haciendo todo lo posible para que el espacio sea accesible a todos, no solo para los ricos"", dijo.

Además del costo, hay otros obstáculos para crear una comunidad espacial, dijo Alatorre, como calcular la cantidad de gravedad artificial que se necesitará, y cumplir las directrices actuales sobre la exposición a la radiación espacial.

Pero como los turistas no se quedarían necesariamente más de un par de semanas, Alatorre sugirió que esto no afectaría a los visitantes, y sería más un problema para quienes trabajen en las estaciones.

Jeffrey A. Hoffman, exastronauta de la NASA que ahora trabaja en el Departamento de Aeronáutica y Astronáutica del MIT, dijo a CNN Travel el año pasado que un gran obstáculo para el turismo espacial sería el temor a la seguridad.

Pero Hoffman sugirió que, al igual que con los viajes aéreos, un historial de seguridad consistente hará que el concepto se popularice, incluso con el riesgo continuo de accidentes.

""Me entusiasma la idea de que muchas, muchas más personas puedan vivir la experiencia de estar en el espacio, y espero que traigan a la Tierra un nuevo sentido de su relación con nuestro planeta"", dijo Hoffman, quien sugirió que la publicidad boca a boca también será clave.

""Cuando se corra la voz y estos primeros viajeros cuenten sus historias, no se podrá mantener a la gente alejada"", dijo.

Alatorre, por su parte, cree que el turismo espacial apenas está comenzando.

""Para la gente que es detractora o que duda, lo que siempre he dicho es: 'Dennos tiempo. Va a suceder, pero no sucederá de la noche a la mañana. Y espérennos, pruébennos. Y les mostraremos lo que hacemos a medida que avancemos y entonces podrán juzgar"".",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/hotel-espacial-orbital-2025-trax/

112,"El secretario de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU. reitera su petición a migrantes en la frontera sur: ""No vengan""","Juez de EE.UU. impide temporalmente derogar el Título 42 2:06

Washington (CNN) -- El secretario de Seguridad Nacional, Alejandro Mayorkas, reiteró este domingo su petición a los migrantes para que no intenten entrar a Estados Unidos por la frontera sur, y dijo que su mensaje para ellos es claro: ""No vengan"".



""Porque nuestra frontera sur no está abierta"", dijo Mayorkas a Dana Bash de CNN en ""State of the Union"". ""Lo que sucede ahora es que los individuos son expulsados por la autoridad del Título 42 o son puestos bajo procedimientos de la ley de inmigración y se les expulsa si no tienen una petición válida bajo nuestra ley para quedarse"".

""Así que, solo para ser claros, si alguien está viendo esto desde otro país y está considerando venir, ¿cuál es su mensaje?"", preguntó Bash.

""No vengan"", respondió el secretario.

Mayorkas dijo que si en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México diariamente se llega al récord de 18.000 migrantes, un escenario potencial planteado por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, por sus siglas en inglés), podría una ""tensión en el sistema"".

El DHS se prepara para múltiples escenarios posibles cuando se levante la restricción de entrada por pandemia de la era Trump conocida como Título 42. La disposición, que invoca el principio de la pandemia de coronavirus, permite a los funcionarios fronterizos rechazar a los inmigrantes en la frontera debido a la crisis de salud pública.

publicidad

El secretario sostuvo que el gobierno de Biden se prepara activamente para cuando quede derogada esa disposición. ""Lo que hacemos es prepararnos y planificar, y lo hemos hecho durante meses"", dijo el domingo. ""Es nuestra responsabilidad estar preparados para diferentes escenarios y eso es lo que estamos haciendo"".

Cuando se le preguntó sobre los legisladores demócratas que argumentan que el departamento no está preparado para una oleada de migrantes en la frontera, Mayorkas dijo: ""Con todo respeto, no estoy de acuerdo"".

Mayorkas subrayó que los preparativos están en marcha y citó un memorando de 20 páginas publicado la semana pasada en el que se describen los planes en detalle.

Sabemos dónde están

Mayorkas también confirmó el domingo que encontraron en la frontera entre EE.UU. y México a 42 individuos que están en la base de datos de detección de terroristas, y dijo a Fox que la administración tiene ""control sobre ello"".

El representante de Ohio Jim Jordan, el principal republicano del Comité Judicial de la Cámara de Representantes, interrogó a Mayorkas la semana pasada sobre las personas encontradas en la frontera sur que estaban en la lista de vigilancia terrorista, y acusó al secretario de no saber dónde estaban. Mayorkas proporcionó más información durante su entrevista con la cadena Fox, diciendo que no quería ""desacertar"" en respuesta a la pregunta de Jordan.

""Sabemos dónde están esos 42 individuos en la lista, la base de datos de detección de terroristas"", dijo.

""Permítanme compartir con ustedes lo que sucede: pueden ser retirados, pueden ser puestos bajo custodia para su procesamiento penal, pueden estar cooperando en una investigación policial, y no tengo intención de proporcionar esos datos públicamente si son sensibles para la aplicación de la ley. Pero sabemos dónde están esos 42, y no he querido hablar del destino actual de todos y cada uno de ellos"".

Cuando se le preguntó si los estadounidenses debían preocuparse, Mayorkas dijo: ""Lo tenemos controlado"", refiriéndose a todo el sistema policial y de inteligencia estadounidense, incluido el FBI.

113,El expresidente colombiano Álvaro Uribe podría ser el primer exmandatario en enfrentar un juicio en este país,"Uribe responde a jueza que negó la preclusión del caso en su contra 3:23

(CNN Español) -- Por cerca de cuatro años, el expresidente colombiano Álvaro Uribe Vélez enfrenta un proceso ante la justicia por supuesto fraude procesal y manipulación de testigos. Por los ‘ires y venires' de este caso, es considerado ya en Colombia por muchos como el expediente judicial más controversial y llamativo de la década. En las últimas horas el exmandatario se pronunció sobre la más reciente decisión de una jueza que determinó no archivar el expediente y mantenerlo vivo. Uribe insistió en negar los señalamientos en su contra y dijo que se le ha “expropiado su reputación”.

El caso de Uribe Vélez se originó en la Corte Suprema de Justicia a raíz de una denuncia que él mismo interpuso contra el senador Iván Cepeda por, supuestamente, manipular testimonios de paramilitares que vinculaban a Uribe con la creación de grupos de autodefensas, específicamente del denominado Bloque Metro que operaba en Medellín y Antioquia.

En febrero de 2018, la Corte Suprema de Justicia concluyó que no había lugar para investigar al congresista Cepeda pero, en cambio, empezó a investigar a Uribe por esa misma conducta. Con base en múltiples interceptaciones de llamadas telefónicas y declaraciones de testigos que denunciaron presiones del abogado Diego Cadena, defensor en ese momento de Uribe, el alto tribunal le abrió investigación formal al expresidente.

En otro sonado episodio de este caso, en agosto del 2020 la Corte ordenó la detención domiciliaria de Uribe y tras esta decisión, el expresidente renunció a su silla en el Senado y a su fuero de congresista, con el argumento de que no tenía garantías para ser juzgado por la alta Corte.

Su caso pasó entonces a manos de la Fiscalía General de la Nación y en noviembre del mismo año, una jueza ordenó la libertad de Uribe.

Entre los meses de julio y agosto del año pasado, ante la jueza 28 de conocimiento de Bogotá, el fiscal encargado del caso, Gabriel Ramón Jaimes, presentó formalmente la sustentación y argumentos según los cuales consideró que el exmandatario no habría incurrido en ningún delito y que no había pruebas suficientes para juzgarlo y en consecuencia, solicitó la preclusión o archivo del expediente.

publicidad

Sin embargo, la semana pasada la juez 28 de conocimiento de Bogotá, Carmen Helena Ortiz, en una audiencia que se prolongó durante casi 12 horas, decidió no avalar dicha petición de la Fiscalía de archivar el caso, y por el contrario mantenerlo vivo. Durante la audiencia, la jueza Ortiz, criticó el trabajo del ente acusador al que consideró insuficiente para demostrar su hipótesis, y por consiguiente Uribe Vélez continúa imputado y ad portas de enfrentar un juicio.

Uribe podría enfrentar juicio tras fallo de jueza 0:39

Posibles futuros escenarios

Teniendo en cuenta que la decisión de la jueza 28 del pasado 27 de abril no fue apelada por la Fiscalía ni por la defensa del expresidente, el proceso penal sigue su curso. Lo que procedería en adelante, es que el ente acusador tendría que presentar el escrito de acusación contra Uribe Vélez para continuar el proceso ante un juzgado de conocimiento. Una vez este se radique, vendría la acusación formal, luego, la etapa preparatoria y el inicio del juicio formal contra el exmandatario. Otro escenario posible que se plantea en este caso es que la Fiscalía podría incluso seguir investigando y pedir una nueva audiencia de preclusión con otros y nuevos argumentos.

Pronunciamiento público de Uribe

En las últimas horas, el pasado domingo 1 de mayo Uribe hizo un pronunciamiento público a través de sus redes sociales y presentó un documento de 41 puntos en los que rechazó la decisión de la jueza 28, reiteró su supuesta inocencia y dijo que con ella, se le había “expropiado” su reputación.

“Nunca tuve la iniciativa de buscar un testigo, simplemente autoricé al doctor Diego Cadena para corroborar la información que me llegaba. No hay una sola prueba que pueda poner en duda esta afirmación”, aseguró el expresidente en el extenso documento.

De igual manera declaró que nunca había tomado la iniciativa de ofrecer beneficios a terceros ni autorizado giros de dinero para sobornar testigos y que nunca ha sido su intención engañar a la justicia.

“Yo no soborno testigos, los confronto. Yo no busco engañar a la justicia, cuando he tenido que denunciar a algún magistrado lo he hecho y de frente”, manifestó Uribe Vélez en su escrito de defensa.

Aunque Uribe se declaró una vez más víctima de un montaje, lo cierto es que el proceso sigue su curso y la reciente decisión judicial de la juez 28 abre la posibilidad de que por primera vez en la historia del país un expresidente de Colombia enfrente un juicio y termine en la silla de los acusados.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/alvaro-uribe-colombia-primer-juicio-podria-orix/

133,El control Backbone One convierte tu iPhone en una verdadera consola de juegos,"Dado que los juegos móviles se están volviendo casi tan avanzados como las ofertas de consolas y PC, sin mencionar el auge de los juegos en la nube, no sorprende que hayamos visto muchos periféricos diseñados para hacer que nuestros celulares se sientan más como plataformas de juegos.

Sin embargo, la mayoría de estas opciones aprovechan los clips que conectan de manera incómoda los controles existentes a nuestros dispositivos o gamepads que se conectan a través de Bluetooth.

El Backbone One renuncia a estos diseños defectuosos y ofrece una opción pulida y diseñada por expertos que esencialmente convierte tu iPhone en una consola de juegos portátil. Compatible con modelos de iPhone desde el 6s, el Backbone se mejora aún más con una aplicación patentada que funciona a la perfección con el control para formar esencialmente tu propio ecosistema de juegos. Más que otra aplicación complementaria desechable, el software realmente complementa el hardware, lo que hace que la experiencia completa de Backbone sea una opción inmejorable para aquellos que buscan mejorar sus sesiones móviles.

El quién, qué y cómo

Para quién es: A US$ 99.99, el Backbone One probablemente no sea para el jugador casual que ocasionalmente juega Clash Royale en su viaje en el transporte. Pero si juegas regularmente títulos como 'Call of Duty: Mobile' o 'Genshin Impact', o usas tu iPhone para disfrutar de juegos de consola y PC a través de servicios de reproducción remota y transmisión en la nube, Backbone es una excelente apuesta. Todavía no hay una versión de Android, pero Backbone asegura que tiene una en camino.

Lo que necesitas saber: El Backbone está diseñado específicamente para iPhone, desde el 6s hasta los últimos modelos. Si usas un iPhone 13 Pro o Pro Max , necesitarás un adaptador para garantizar un ajuste perfecto, pero Backbone proporciona este accesorio de forma gratuita si lo pides. Una vez unidos a través del conector Lightning, el iPhone y Backbone se convierten en una plataforma de juego unificada, que se parece mucho a Nintendo Switch.

Cómo se compara: el competidor más cercano de Backbone es el Razer Kishi, un control dedicado de diseño (y precio) similar para el iPhone. Si bien Kishi ofrece controles con calidad de consola (y viene en una variación de Android), el diseño de Backbone es más ergonómico y su aplicación es más robusta y está mejor integrada.

Controles de calidad de la consola

Si bien muchos periféricos te permiten jugar juegos móviles con controles similares a los de una consola, Backbone se siente mucho menos como un accesorio que mejora ligeramente la experiencia y más como un dispositivo diseñado para transformar su iPhone en una plataforma de juegos portátil.

Esto es evidente nada más sacarlo de la caja, ya que Backbone inmediatamente se siente tan resistente y sólido como un gamepad de consola. De hecho, pasarás solo unos minutos con él y es fácil olvidar que no estás jugando en algo más parecido a un Nintendo Switch o Steam Deck.

Por supuesto, sus entradas premium y su diseño ergonómico venden aún más esta sensación una vez que lo colocas en su lugar. Un cruce entre los Joy-Cons de Nintendo y un gamepad de Xbox, el Backbone cuenta con todos los botones, joysticks y gatillos esperados, así como un D-pad. Las designaciones de los botones son las mismas que las del diseño A, B, X, Y del controlador de Xbox, mientras que sus botones de desplazamiento imitan de manera similar el periférico de Microsoft.

Todos tus juegos en un solo lugar

Más allá de las inclusiones táctiles esperadas, el Backbone tiene un conector para audífonos y un puerto Lightning para la carga de transferencia.

El dispositivo también alberga un botón naranja adornado con el logotipo de Backbone. Esta entrada proporciona la puerta de entrada a una de las mejores y más sorprendentes funciones del controlador: la aplicación Backbone+. Al presionarlo, se abre la interfaz del dispositivo, lo que le permite acceder a sus juegos y servicios, conectarse con amigos y, en general, sentirse como si estuvieras navegando por un centro cuidadosamente diseñado, similar a los que aparecen al encender una PlayStation 5 o Xbox Series X o Series S.

Optimizada e intuitiva, la aplicación impresiona de inmediato, ya que cambia entre sus juegos favoritos y los servicios y funciones compatibles, desde PlayStation Remote Play y Steam Link hasta Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming , Amazon Luna , Apple Arcade y muchos más. Los streamers y miembros de la sociedad también apreciarán su perfecta integración con Twitch, el chat de voz y los lobbies, así como la captura, edición y uso compartido de pantallas y videos, todo muy bien respaldado por botones dedicados ubicados debajo del D-pad.

Más que admitir una tonelada de contenido y servicios, es la capacidad de la aplicación para presentarlo todo en un lugar de fácil acceso lo que la hace brillar. Como propietario de Xbox Series X y un PlayStation 5, es bastante alucinante ver a estos competidores de consola sentados uno al lado del otro en la misma interfaz. Utilizar las funciones de reproducción remota de ambas plataformas dentro de Backbone+ significa que puedo cambiar entre las exclusivas de Sony y Microsoft, como Horizon Forbidden West y Halo Infinite, respectivamente, desde un menú compartido en menos de 30 segundos. La descarga de títulos de la App Store sin tener que cambiar entre Backbone+ y la tienda de Apple es igualmente impresionante. Es bastante salvaje lo unificado que se siente todo.

Llegar a este punto de cohesión maravillosa requiere cierta configuración y trabajo preliminar detrás de escena, como iniciar sesión en sus diversas cuentas, configurar opciones de juego remoto en sus consolas y agregar juegos favoritos presionando el botón Backbone. Pero una vez que hayas pasado unos 15 minutos sentando las bases, encontrarás que Backbone+ presenta el tipo de experiencia de pantalla de inicio típicamente reservada para las consolas.

Conclusión

Como alguien que lucha por adoptar los controles táctiles de los juegos móviles y aún no encuentra un periférico que haga que el juego remoto se sienta tan bien como jugar en una consola, encontré el Backbone One bastante transformador. Su diseño sólido y ergonómico, sus controles receptivos y su fantástica integración de aplicaciones han convertido, para todos los efectos, mi iPhone en una nueva plataforma de juegos que no sabía que necesitaba. Para bien o para mal, estoy jugando más que nunca con el Backbone, comprimiendo sesiones donde normalmente no lo haría.

Mi mayor queja con el dispositivo también es un cumplido: debido a que lo uso mucho, quitar mi engorroso estuche protector de dos piezas para conectarlo se ha convertido en una tarea habitual. En serio, necesito un nuevo estuche que sea más fácil de poner y quitar o un segundo teléfono para proporcionar un hogar permanente para el Backbone. También vale la pena señalar que Backbone aún no es compatible con dispositivos Android, por lo que los propietarios de teléfonos inteligentes de Google que buscan jugar mientras viajan pueden querer ver el Razer Kishi.

Otro problema potencial es uno que no se puede evaluar correctamente durante otros 12 meses, el tiempo que Backbone+ se proporciona de forma gratuita. Los nuevos usuarios de Backbone obtienen la aplicación durante un año (así como un mes gratis de Xbox Game Pass Ultimate), pero luego se les cobrarán US$ 49 al año. En este momento no puedo imaginar usar Backbone sin su aplicación, pero queda por ver cómo evolucionará el software y qué características, si las hay, estarán disponibles para aquellos que se enfurecen ante la idea de suscribirse a otra suscripción.

Dicho todo esto, si bien Backbone+ sin duda mejora la experiencia general, especialmente cuando no se paga por él, el hardware en sí sigue siendo una recomendación fácil para cualquiera que quiera jugar juegos móviles con controles que rivalizan con la consola o disfrutar de los beneficios del juego remoto y transmisión en la nube.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/cnne-underscored/2022/04/29/control-backbone-one-iphone/?iid=cnneunderscoredDTHP

136,Los mejores iPhone: aquí están los modelos disponibles en el mercado,"El iPhone 13 marca las casillas principales en un tamaño que te permite hacer mucho. Si bien el iPhone 13 Mini es idéntico en términos de rendimiento, el espacio de pantalla adicional del iPhone 13 lo hace más útil y el teclado se siente mucho menos apretado.

El tamaño de la pantalla de 6,1 pulgadas es bastante grande para navegar por páginas web, desplazarse por las líneas de tiempo y, lo que es más importante, usar el teclado. A diferencia del 13 Mini, tiene un teclado espacioso que es fácil de aprender y se parecerá más a los iPhone anteriores. El iPhone 13 cuenta con una pantalla OLED, que ofrece colores vibrantes y negros profundos para el texto.

Sin embargo, lo que no encontrarás en el iPhone 13 es una frecuencia de actualización alta. No es un factor decisivo si vienes de un dispositivo con la misma frecuencia de actualización más baja, pero estándar. Si bien el iPhone 13 Pro y Pro Max cuentan con una frecuencia de actualización más alta (120 Hz en comparación con los 60 Hz del 13) y, por lo tanto, el contenido se transmite de manera un poco más fluida, la diferencia seguirá siendo demasiado sutil para la persona promedio como para justificar el elevado precio de actualización.

El iPhone 13 presenta uno de los mejores sistemas de doble cámara que hemos probado, que consta de una lente ancha de 12 megapíxeles y una lente ultra ancha de 12 megapíxeles. Las imágenes son nítidas con más detalles y toques de color que la mayoría de los otros teléfonos inteligentes, aunque el cambio real se produce con la iluminación adecuada. Gracias a un sensor más grande que captura más luz, descubrimos que las imágenes tomadas incluso en entornos con poca luz no se ven borrosas.

El iPhone 13 comienza con 128 GB de almacenamiento interno (el mismo precio inicial que tienen el 12 y el 12 Mini con solo 64 GB), lo que debería ser suficiente para la mayoría de los usuarios.

Quienes deseen un teléfono más pequeño con las mismas funciones pueden optar por el iPhone 13 Mini de 5,4 pulgadas, cuyo precio inicial es de $699.

Mejor iPhone para fotografía: iPhone 13 Pro

Aquellos que quieran las mejores cámaras posibles para capturar fotos o videos en cualquier entorno deben optar por el iPhone 13 Pro. Cuenta con un sistema de triple cámara: una gran angular de 12 megapíxeles, una ultra gran angular de 12 megapíxeles y un teleobjetivo de 12 megapíxeles.

Todos estos cuentan con nuevos sensores y lentes, que les permiten captar aún más luz, lo que resulta en una mejora dramática para las tomas con poca luz, normalmente conocidas por contener algo de grano, ruido y desenfoque. Pero estas cámaras mejoradas eliminan todo ese ruido y contienen una gran cantidad de luz y detalles. Es una mejora notable con respecto al iPhone 12 Pro y 12 Pro Max, pero aún más con dispositivos más antiguos.

El teleobjetivo aquí le permite acercarse ópticamente sin moverse físicamente ni sacrificar datos. Es una mejora significativa con respecto al zoom digital, que agrega rápidamente desenfoque y pérdida de detalles en la toma. El iPhone 13 Pro da un salto notable con imágenes y videografía. Por supuesto, puede disparar en modo Retrato y modo Noche; grabe video en hasta 4K, capture contenido en cámara lenta o en lapso de tiempo; y use el nuevo modo Cinemático, que es similar al modo Retrato para video que funcionó bastante bien en nuestras pruebas.

El iPhone 13 Pro impresiona con una pantalla OLED de 6,1 pulgadas aún mejor que la del iPhone 13. Aún obtendrá una pantalla nítida y vibrante, pero puede volverse súper brillante, lo que le permite usarla en cualquier condición de iluminación, incluso bajo la luz solar directa . El 13 Pro también tiene una pantalla de alta frecuencia de actualización, lo que hace que el contenido se vea más realista y la transmisión de contenido sea fluida.

Y al igual que el iPhone 13, el 13 Pro también funciona con el último chip móvil fabricado por Apple: el A15 Bionic. En nuestra prueba de batería, el 13 Pro duró 14 horas, más que las 12 horas y 10 minutos del 12 Pro.

El mejor iPhone económico: iPhone SE 2022

Si deseas el rendimiento de un iPhone moderno pero no quieres gastar US$ 1,000 en un teléfono nuevo, o simplemente prefieres algo más pequeño, el iPhone SE 2022 es para ti. El iPhone de US$ 429 de Apple hace muy pocos compromisos en el departamento de energía, con el mismo procesador A15 Bionic veloz que encontrarás en la última gama de iPhone 13. No tendrás problemas para realizar múltiples tareas entre aplicaciones o jugar los juegos de iOS más nuevos aquí.

El SE también es el iPhone más pequeño de la línea, ya que incluye toda esa potencia en un diseño de 4,7 pulgadas que es especialmente ideal para aquellos con manos pequeñas (o bolsillos pequeños). El diseño recuerda a los iPhone antiguos, lo que significa algunos biseles de pantalla bastante gruesos en la parte superior e inferior, pero también un sensor de huellas dactilares Touch ID que no encontrarás en modelos más premium. Su pantalla Retina HD se ve genial para ver películas y jugar, y aunque no tiene las mismas matrices de dos o tres cámaras de la serie iPhone 13, su lente de 12 megapíxeles captura fotos sólidas y tiene la capacidad de dispare en modo Retrato para obtener retratos de aspecto profesional.

Entonces, ¿a qué estás renunciando a este precio? La pantalla del iPhone SE no es tan grande ni tan fluida como la que encontrarás en el iPhone 13 y 13 Pro, y carece de la tecnología ProMotion de este último que permite un desplazamiento y una transmisión extra suaves a 120 Hz. Tampoco obtendrá capacidades MagSafe para conectar magnéticamente cargadores y estuches compatibles, ni podrá desbloquear su teléfono con su rostro a través de Face ID. Pero si puedes vivir sin tener el sistema de cámara más avanzado, el diseño más elegante o la pantalla más grande, el iPhone SE es un iPhone compacto y de gran rendimiento que le durará años, y a una fracción del precio de un iPhone 13. .

Otros iPhone que vale la pena considerar

iPhone 12

Desde US$ 599 en Apple

Con el lanzamiento del iPhone 13, Apple redujo el costo del iPhone 12 a un precio inicial de US$ 699 para el modelo principal y US$ 599 para el iPhone 12 mini. Como actualización, el iPhone 12 debutó con un diseño de borde plano que Apple ahora ha seguido usando en la nueva línea de iPad Mini y iPhone 13.

Y seamos claros: el procesador A14 Bionic que alimenta el iPhone 12 es casi tan rápido como el del iPhone 13. Es realmente una actualización nominal que aumenta la eficiencia y hace que las aplicaciones se abran un poco más rápido. El iPhone 12 es lo suficientemente rápido para las tareas diarias y para jugar. Sin embargo, las tareas que requieren un uso más intensivo del procesador, como la edición de video, verán mejoras en el nuevo iPhone 13.

Una posible desventaja de optar por el modelo de iPhone 12 es que la cantidad de almacenamiento base comienza en 64 GB, mientras que la línea de iPhone 13 comienza en 128 GB; 64 GB es bastante delgado, y si tiene una gran biblioteca de fotos, muchas canciones descargadas o una gran cantidad de aplicaciones, es probable que reciba una alerta de almacenamiento más temprano que tarde, por lo que el iPhone 13 sería una mejor opción para aquellos que tienden a acumular archivos digitales en su teléfono.

El iPhone 12 ofrece una buena experiencia de cámara. No obtendrás el nuevo modo Cinematic video o Macro que tiene el iPhone 13, pero aún obtendrás dos cámaras traseras de 12 megapíxeles. Ambos ofrecen detalles nítidos y colores precisos, pero si te gusta la fotografía, notarás que el 13 hace un mejor trabajo iluminando la toma. Con las fotos tomadas con el iPhone 13, hay una profundidad más clara entre el primer plano y el fondo, como una foto clásica de alguien frente a una puesta de sol. Aún así, obtienes un tirador muy capaz en el iPhone 12.

Ambos teléfonos ejecutan iOS 15, el último sistema operativo del iPhone, y seguramente seguirán siendo compatibles durante los próximos años. Esas son buenas noticias, ya que sigue siendo un precio elevado y no deseas invertir en un teléfono que no será compatible en unos años.

iPhone 11

Desde US$ 499 en Apple

Si aún deseas un iPhone 11 moderno con una pantalla casi sin marco y Face ID para desbloquear fácilmente, el iPhone 11 es una opción asequible que combina un rendimiento sólido y funciones modernas, todo a un precio más manejable de $ 499 para el modelo de 64 GB ($ 549 para 128 GB).

La diferencia clave entre el iPhone 11 y los modelos más nuevos es que opta por una pantalla LCD de 6,1 pulgadas en lugar de una OLED. No es tan brillante ni nítido como los modelos más nuevos, pero aun así ofrece una experiencia de visualización clara que, en última instancia, prolonga la duración de la batería.

Hay dos cámaras traseras en la parte posterior del iPhone 11, una para tomas ultra anchas, una de nuestras funciones favoritas, y una cámara estándar, ambas de 12 megapíxeles. Las imágenes ofrecen una gran cantidad de detalles y siguen siendo dignas de Instagram, pero no ofrecen el nivel de detalles que puede ofrecer el iPhone 13. Las tomas con poca luz son mediocres en comparación con las tomadas con cualquiera de los modelos más nuevos.

Con todo, el iPhone 11 es una elección digna para aquellos que desean un diseño moderno con Face ID y están comprando con un presupuesto específico.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/cnne-underscored/2022/04/28/mejores-iphone-2022/?iid=cnneunderscoredDTHP

142,Las primarias de mayo pondrán a prueba el toque de Trump como líder del Partido Republicano,"Departamento de Justicia busca US$ 2,9 millones de Manafort 1:13

(CNN) -- La capacidad del expresidente de Estados Unidos Donald Trump para elegir a los candidatos ganadores se pondrá a prueba a medida que el calendario de las primarias se ponga en marcha este mes con una serie de contiendas polémicas que comenzarán este martes en Ohio.

La mayoría de los candidatos republicanos de este mes han intentado apelar a Trump durante sus campañas, lo que ya es una victoria para el expresidente. Pero despejar el campo y navegar hacia una posible candidatura a la Casa Blanca en 2024 dependerá en parte de su capacidad para demostrar que sigue siendo el líder inigualable del Partido Republicano.

La contienda por el Senado del Partido Republicano de Ohio es un excelente ejemplo de cómo la genuflexión ante el expresidente está impulsando el debate en muchas primarias republicanas en todo el país. Trump puso patas arriba lo que ya era una carrera al revés al respaldar a JD Vance, el autor de ""Hillbilly Elegy"" y antiguo crítico de Trump, quien desde entonces se ha retractado. Pero incluso después de que Trump apoyó a Vance, describiéndolo como ""un guerrero"" contra lo que el expresidente llama falsamente ""elección presidencial manipulada y robada"", varios de los rivales republicanos de Vance han clamado para demostrar que están más alineados con los valores de Trump.

Esa ha sido una dinámica común a lo largo de muchas de las elecciones primarias de este mes. La lealtad a Trump jugará un papel importante en una carrera por la Cámara de Representantes de EE.UU. en Virginia Occidental, la semana siguiente, cuando el candidato respaldado por Trump, el representante Alex Mooney, se enfrentará al representante republicano, David McKinley, en la primera primaria titular contra titular del ciclo. Mooney se ganó el cariño de Trump al objetar el recuento electoral de Pensilvania cuando el Congreso certificaba la victoria de Joe Biden en las elecciones generales. McKinley votó para certificar la victoria de Biden y respaldó la formación de una comisión independiente para investigar el ataque del 6 de enero de 2021 contra el Capitolio de EE.UU., un esfuerzo fallido en el Senado.

Uno de los enfrentamientos senatoriales más caros de este año tendrá lugar en Pensilvania el 17 de mayo. El candidato de Trump, el famoso cirujano Mehmet Oz, está en una acalorada carrera contra, entre otros, David McCormick, exdirector ejecutivo de fondos de cobertura, que ha criticado a Oz por las inconsistencias ideológicas que mostró a lo largo de su carrera televisiva.

Finalmente, el 24 de mayo, Trump tendrá la oportunidad de vengar al gobernador republicano de Georgia, Brian Kemp, por rechazar sus esquemas electorales de 2020. El presidente atrajo al exsenador David Perdue a la carrera contra el gobernador en ejercicio, lo que generó una reyerta interna del partido que muchos en el Partido Republicano consideraron inútil.

Las contiendas de mayo resumen la larga sombra que las quejas personales de Trump continúan arrojando sobre su partido y la medida en que ha atrapado a sus leales republicanos en un túnel del tiempo mientras, al mismo tiempo, los alienta a seguir impulsando sus afirmaciones sin fundamento de fraude electoral de 2020, en un momento en el que muchos estadounidenses tienen preocupaciones más apremiantes.

La oportunidad de Trump en las elecciones intermedias

Los votantes están luchando con el aumento de los precios de la gasolina y los comestibles ya que las presiones inflacionarias no muestran signos de disminuir. Hay nuevos indicios de que la economía podría encaminarse hacia una recesión. Y el índice de aprobación del presidente Joe Biden se registró en un 41% en el último promedio de encuestas nacionales recientes de CNN, una situación que históricamente ha llevado a grandes pérdidas en la Cámara de Representantes para el partido en la Casa Blanca.

Pero Trump nunca ha mostrado mucha preocupación por la forma en que sus ambiciones personales han descarrilado las oportunidades de enviar mensajes más efectivamente de su partido, y 2022 le ha dado la oportunidad de elegir a candidatos que son tan implacables como él para seguir sembrando dudas sobre los resultados de 2020, a pesar de que no hay evidencia de fraude electoral generalizado.

El impulso por complacer a Trump y a su base ha contribuido a la atracción gravitatoria de los candidatos primarios republicanos de derecha, una vulnerabilidad que los demócratas planean capitalizar este otoño mientras buscan retener a los votantes suburbanos y moderados que Trump alienó.

""Estas primarias son realmente cruciales porque es la primera prueba que tenemos del respaldo de Trump y ver si algunos candidatos potencialmente más débiles a los que él ha respaldado podrían terminar como los postulados"", dijo Jessica Taylor, editora del Senado y gobernadores del Cook Political Report con Amy Walter.

""Él es quien conduce la narrativa. De esa manera, ya ganó. Todos estos candidatos, independientemente de si obtuvieron el respaldo de Trump o no, están tratando febrilmente de convertirse en el molde de Make America Great Agrain"" agregó Taylor.

3 de mayo: acaloradas primarias para el Senado de Ohio

El representante demócrata Tim Ryan ha consolidado en gran medida el apoyo de su partido detrás de su búsqueda de la postulación para ocupar el puesto del senador republicano Rob Portman.

Eso ha significado que la mayor parte del drama ha sido en las concurridas primarias republicanas para el Senado, centrándose en los últimos días en si Vance merecía el visto bueno de Trump. Si bien el expresidente estaba dispuesto a mirar más allá de las críticas pasadas de Vance, el brazo político del Club for Growth está utilizando esas declaraciones como un arma en su intento de impulsar al extesorero estatal Josh Mandel, a pesar de que esos movimientos han enojado a Trump.

Un anuncio de Club for Growth Action en la última semana mostraba un clip antiguo de Vance refiriéndose a sí mismo como un ""chico que nunca estará con Trump"" mientras un espectador incrédulo pregunta: ""¿Trump ha visto esto?"" y afirma que el expresidente ""se está equivocando"" con su respaldo. (Vance se ha esforzado por abordar su conversión en la campaña electoral, pidiendo a los votantes que le den crédito por admitir un error).

Antes de que Trump interviniera en la contienda, Mandel, que sirvió en la Reserva del Cuerpo de Marines, y Mike Gibbons, un rico hombre de negocios autofinanciado, parecían estar listos para liderar el campo: su propia rivalidad se volvió tan acalorada que aparecieron al borde de los golpes en un debate. Mandel ha hecho repetidamente la afirmación falsa de que a Trump le robaron las elecciones de 2020 y dijo a los periodistas el viernes que ""deberíamos auditar [los resultados electorales de] todos los estados de la nación, incluidos los que ganó Trump"".

Pero se está apoyando en otras figuras conservadoras para que lo ayuden a llevar su campaña hasta la meta, incluido el senador de Texas Ted Cruz. En campaña con Mandel en Ohio este fin de semana, Cruz se burló de los candidatos que ""tienen a Donald Trump tatuado en el trasero"" y dijo que los votantes deberían considerar la consistencia de los registros de los candidatos como conservadores.

En la carrera por la gobernación, el titular Mike DeWine lidera a sus oponentes en las primarias republicanas, según encuestas recientes, a pesar de que ha sido un blanco frecuente del ala pro-Trump de su partido. El enfoque más restrictivo que DeWine adoptó para las precauciones de covid-19, en comparación con otros gobernadores republicanos, provocó que algunos conservadores y Trump criticaran a DeWine en un mitin reciente en el estado como ""terrible"". Pero Trump no ha respaldado en la carrera.

El exrepresentante Jim Renacci, quien perdió ante el senador demócrata Sherrod Brown en la carrera por el Senado de 2018, y el agricultor Joe Blystone, quien ha criticado los mandatos de mascarillas y vacunación contra el covid, así como lo que considera una extralimitación del Gobierno de DeWine, parecen estar fragmentándose.

10 de mayo: Un controvertido respaldo de Trump en Nebraska

Trump tiene un historial de respaldo a candidatos problemáticos que han causado dolores de cabeza a su partido, una dinámica en juego en las primarias para gobernador de Nebraska el 10 de mayo.

Trump ha respaldado a Charles Herbster, un ranchero y hombre de negocios, y lo ha apoyado incluso después de que el Nebraska Examiner informara, a mediados de abril, que siete mujeres, incluida la senadora estatal republicana Julie Slama, habían acusado a Herbster de manosearlas en eventos políticos o concursos de belleza, con una mujer adicional acusándolo de besarla a la fuerza. En seis casos, al menos un testigo corroboró las acusaciones de las mujeres, informó la publicación. Herbster ha negado las acusaciones, calificándolas de ""100% falsas"".

El gobernador republicano, Pete Ricketts, que había instado a Trump a mantenerse al margen de la contienda, respaldó a uno de los rivales republicanos de Herbster, Jim Pillen, criador de cerdos y veterinario que forma parte de la Junta de Regentes de la Universidad de Nebraska. Ricketts describió las acusaciones como ""más que horribles"" y dijo que Herbster debería ""buscar tratamiento"".

En un mitin a favor de Herbster, el domingo por la noche, Trump afirmó que Herbster estaba siendo ""gravemente calumniado"".

""Defiendo a las personas cuando sé que son buenas; él es un buen hombre"", dijo Trump, siguiendo su antiguo patrón de desestimar las acusaciones de acoso y agresión sexual, incluidas las que se presentaron en su contra en su campaña de 2016 cuando dijo eran ""todas cosas falsas"" y afirmaba que él era ""una víctima"".

17 de mayo: las contiendas reñidas para los candidatos de Trump en Pensilvania y Carolina del Norte

La contienda para reemplazar al senador republicano Pat Toomey, en Pensilvania, quien se jubila, está en camino de convertirse en una de las más caras del país, ya que el estatus perenne de estado indeciso hace que ese escaño entre los más propensos a pasar del control republicano al demócrata.

La mayor parte del gasto está del lado del Partido Republicano. Como Oz y McCormick y sus aliados externos han invertido sus recursos en anuncios de televisión, la carrera superó la marca de los 100 millones de dólares a fines de abril. Está previsto que Trump aparezca en nombre de Oz en un mitin el próximo fin de semana. Y en una muestra notable de la esclavitud que ejerce sobre su partido, la mayoría de los candidatos republicanos dijeron en un debate reciente que era demasiado pronto para que su partido superara las elecciones de 2020.

McCormick contrató a una lista de exasesores de Trump y buscó agresivamente su respaldo, prodigando elogios a las políticas de la era Trump, ya que él y sus aliados han retratado a Oz como un RINO, o ""republicano solo de nombre"". Uno de los anuncios recientes de McCormick argumenta que el expresidente respaldó a la persona equivocada al respaldar a un médico famoso que elogió a figuras vilipendiadas por los conservadores, incluida la exsecretaria de Estado Hillary Clinton y el Dr. Anthony Fauci, uno de los principales asesores médicos de Biden.

Los demócratas tienen una carrera competitiva propia entre el vicegobernador John Fetterman, el representante Conor Lamb y el representante estatal Malcolm Kenyatta. Fetterman se ha convertido en el candidato a vencer en virtud de su recaudación de fondos y el reconocimiento de su nombre en todo el estado. Lamb, un centrista que ha argumentado que sus victorias pasadas en distritos de tendencia republicana demuestran su capacidad para ganar en todo el estado, ha dicho que el perfil más progresista de Fetterman lo convertiría en un riesgo demasiado grande en las elecciones generales. A pesar de esos ataques, Fetterman le dijo a CNN que no ve la necesidad de moderar sus posturas, que incluyen abogar por más control de armas, acceso al aborto y atención médica universal, especialmente en un momento en que los republicanos en el Congreso no han mostrado interés en comprometerse.

La otra competencia principal en el Senado el 17 de mayo es la carrera para reemplazar al senador Richard Burr que se retira en Carolina del Norte, donde Trump respaldó al representante Ted Budd, quien respaldó las maniobras electorales del expresidente en 2020 votando para descartar los resultados electorales en Arizona y Pensilvania, en enero de 2021.

El respaldo de Trump hace casi un año no logró despejar el campo para Budd, quien ha sido impulsado por el Club for Growth Action que publica anuncios que critican al exgobernador Pat McCrory.

McCrory, a su vez, acusó a Budd de ser ""imprudente"" con sus palabras, publicando un anuncio engañoso centrado en los comentarios de Budd sobre el presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin, e intentando vincularlo en un anuncio digital reciente con el representante republicano Madison Cawthorn, un figura polarizadora en la política de Carolina del Norte.

Cheri Beasley, la primera mujer negra en encabezar la Corte Suprema de Carolina del Norte como presidenta, es muy favorecida por el lado demócrata.

En todo el país, Trump también intervino en la lucha interna del partido del 17 de mayo en la contienda por la gobernación de Idaho, respaldando a la vicegobernadora, Janice McGeachin, en su principal desafío al gobernador Brad Little. Mostrando una inclinación por la teatralidad al estilo Trump, McGeachin captó brevemente la atención nacional el año pasado al usar la ausencia de Little del estado para emitir una orden ejecutiva que prohíbe los mandatos de uso de mascarillas. (Poco más tarde, derogó la orden, calificándola de ""truco político egoísta""). En octubre, Little acusó a McGeachin de intentar desplegar la Guardia Nacional estatal en la frontera entre EE.UU. y México mientras estaba en el estado visitando la frontera. A pesar del ""respaldo completo y total"" de Trump, McGeachin no parece haber ganado mucha fuerza.

24 de mayo: Trump intenta vengar su derrota en Georgia

La derrota de Trump en Georgia ha impulsado su participación en el estado, específicamente su celo por derrocar a Kemp y al secretario de Estado, Brad Raffensperger, quien rechazó la solicitud de Trump de que ""encontrara"" más de 11.000 votos para anular la victoria de Biden en el estado. Trump ha respaldado a la representante republicana Jody Hice, quien abrazó sus conspiraciones electorales, en su contra.

Georgia se convirtió en el primer estado donde el programa del Comité de Acción Política Make America Great Again, Again!, afiliado a Trump, extendió sus esfuerzos a las ondas de radio, según datos de AdImpact. Su anuncio promocionaba tanto a Perdue, la elección de Trump para gobernador, como a la exestrella de la NFL Herschel Walker, quien cuenta con el respaldo tanto de Trump como del líder republicano en el Senado, Mitch McConnell, para que el Partido Republicano se enfrente al senador demócrata Raphael Warnock.

Si bien el compromiso de Trump con Walker ayudó a mantener a otros importantes republicanos fuera de la carrera por el Senado, no está claro que su respaldo a Perdue haya tenido el efecto deseado. Los esfuerzos del exsenador para animar a los leales a Trump argumentando que Kemp podría haber hecho más para cuestionar los resultados de las elecciones hasta el momento no han demostrado ser una estrategia ganadora.

Kemp, quien obtuvo importantes victorias conservadoras en la legislación que restringe el aborto y legaliza que la mayoría de los georgianos porten un arma de fuego oculta sin licencia, ha sido respaldado por grupos como la Asociación de Gobernadores Republicanos, que emitió anuncios que lo promocionaban como un ""líder conservador comprobado"". Como exsecretario de Estado, ha refutado los ataques de Perdue argumentando que no tenía la autoridad para alterar los resultados de las elecciones. Kemp señaló en un debate, a fines de abril, que no ""será sermoneado por alguien que perdió sus últimas elecciones"", refiriéndose a la derrota de Perdue ante el demócrata Jon Ossoff, en la segunda vuelta de enero de 2021.

Los votantes en Alabama también acuden a las urnas el 24 de mayo, pero Trump ya no está directamente involucrado en las primarias republicanas para el Senado allí después de que rescindió su respaldo al representante republicano Mo Brooks, una vez uno de sus lugartenientes más leales en el Capitolio, molesto tanto por la campaña agitada del congresista como por su afirmación de que los votantes deberían dejar atrás las elecciones de 2020.

Dos de los rivales de Brooks para reemplazar al senador republicano por retirarse Richard Shelby, la exasistente de Shelby Katie Britt y Mike Durant, un veterano y ejecutivo aeroespacial, han liderado el campo republicano.

El récord de respaldo de Donald Trump

Muchos de los republicanos que se postulan en las primarias de mayo se han presentado como candidatos de Trump, pero las contiendas de este mes serán la primera prueba de si las apuestas de respaldo de Trump dan sus frutos con victorias.

Pero Scott Jennings, un estratega republicano y colaborador de CNN, dijo que incluso si el expresidente termina con un historial mixto, es probable que adopte lo que llamó la postura tradicional de Trump de que ""de todo lo bueno que sucede, yo soy responsable"" y todo lo malo que sucede ""es culpa de otra persona"".

A medida que toman forma las contiendas de las elecciones generales, Jennings predijo que el enfoque en las obsesiones electorales de Trump en 2020 comenzará a desvanecerse a medida que conectarse con las preocupaciones económicas de los votantes se convierta en el objetivo primordial del Partido Republicano.

""Mi opinión personal es que si no estás hablando de la inflación y los precios de la gasolina, la economía, el crimen y las escuelas en el otoño, eres un idiota"", dijo. ""Es obvio lo que preocupa a la gente... Hacer de la carrera un referéndum sobre Biden sobre esos temas"".",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/primarias-mayo-pondran-a-prueba-trump-lider-partido-republicano-trax/
143,ANÁLISIS | El entorno político es terrible para los demócratas de cara a las elecciones intermedias... y puede empeorar,"Polémica tras pedido de Biden de más fondos para Ucrania 5:52

(CNN) -- El mandato de Joe Biden se ha convertido en el remate de un chiste, incluso para el propio presidente.

Biden pudo haber sido generoso al burlarse de sí mismo en la cena de gala anual de la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca el sábado por la noche, por sus índices de aprobación mellados y su incapacidad para promulgar completamente su agenda nacional.

Pero sus bromas tenían sus raíces en la dolorosa realidad de una presidencia rehén de fuerzas económicas y globales fuera de su control y agravadas por algunos de los errores tácticos de su Casa Blanca.

El resultado es que un año después de que su índice de aprobación superara cómodamente el 50%, el presidente y su partido se enfrentan al contexto político más traicionero en años en el período previo a las elecciones intermedias de noviembre.

Es posible que los altos precios de la gasolina, la peor inflación en 40 años, la guerra en Ucrania y una pandemia persistente puedan disminuir en noviembre. Pero la trayectoria de esas crisis, y el impacto que ejercen en temas que son importantes para los estadounidenses y que pueden perjudicarlos, como el precio de los comestibles, también podría empeorar.

publicidad

La gran nueva lucha de China contra el covid-19, por ejemplo, impulsada por su baja tasa de vacunación, y sus represivos confinamientos amenazan con volver a aplastar las líneas de la cadena de suministro global que ayudaron a impulsar la inflación en primer lugar. Y si la guerra en Ucrania, como se esperaba, impacta severamente la cosecha en el granero de Europa este año, los estadounidenses podrían ver cómo se disparan los precios de los productos básicos diarios, ya que Ucrania es una gran fuente de granos y aceite de girasol a nivel mundial.

Por lo tanto, es bastante probable que las abrumadoras condiciones que actualmente deprimen las esperanzas de los demócratas empeoren antes del día de las elecciones intermedias.

Polémica tras pedido de Biden de más fondos para Ucrania 5:52

La inflación acaba las esperanzas de los demócratas para las elecciones intermedias

Todo esto explica una sensación de inevitabilidad que se asienta en la sabiduría convencional de Washington de que los republicanos están fuertemente favorecidos para retomar el control de la Cámara de Representantes, mientras que el Senado también podría tornarse rojo.

Algunos analistas económicos han sugerido que la inflación, en su peor momento desde la década de 1980, ha tocado techo. Pero un índice clave observado por la Reserva Federal, el índice de precios de gastos de consumo personal, subió un 6,6% en el año que finalizó en marzo, según cifras publicadas la semana pasada. Los precios de la energía disparados por la guerra en Ucrania aumentaron en un 33,9 % y los alimentos aumentaron en un 9,2 % durante el mismo período. Otro informe de la semana pasada mostró una sorpresiva disminución del producto interno bruto del 1,4% en el primer trimestre. Si bien hubo factores técnicos que podrían significar que la cifra no es tan mala como parece, generó temores de una recesión, luego de las advertencias de una recesión en el horizonte de varios grandes bancos de Wall Street.

Estas cifras llegan a la debilidad fundamental del caso de los demócratas a medida que se acercan a las elecciones intermedias. Biden no puede asegurar todo el crédito por el fuerte repunte de la economía de la pandemia y las cifras históricamente buenas de empleo porque millones de estadounidenses están descontentos con los altos precios.

El triunfo de Biden al vencer al entonces presidente Donald Trump en 2020 fue un ejemplo del poder de las comparaciones. Ofreció un regreso al liderazgo tranquilo después del tumulto de los cuatro años anteriores de escándalos, mentiras y caos en la Casa Blanca.

Pero las elecciones intermedias de 2022 ya se están convirtiendo en un referéndum sobre el presidente y los demócratas, quienes controlan todas las palancas del poder político en Washington y, por lo tanto, llevan la lata del descontento actual del público.

Una nueva encuesta de The Washington Post/ABC News publicada el domingo lo confirma.

Si bien el índice general de aprobación del trabajo de Biden aumentó hasta el 42%, solo el 38% de los encuestados aprobaron su manejo de la economía. Y el 68% desaprobó su historial sobre la inflación. El tema resultó particularmente molesto para los votantes independientes que serán cruciales en las reñidas contiendas por la Cámara y el Senado en noviembre.

¿Qué temas serán parte del discurso del estado de la Unión? 0:44

Las fallas de la Casa Blanca

La difícil situación del presidente con respecto a la inflación se ha visto exacerbada por las afirmaciones anteriores de su propia Casa Blanca de que el aumento de los precios fue ""transitorio"", un mensaje de error que amenaza con restarle confianza a los votantes en los pronunciamientos de la administración y que ofrece un blanco fácil para los republicanos.

Y aunque Biden ha tomado varias medidas para hacer frente a los altos precios, incluidos los programas para desbloquear los puertos estadounidenses y la cadena de suministro obstruida y ha liberado millones de barriles de petróleo de las reservas estratégicas de la nación, sus esfuerzos no parecen haber tenido un impacto notable en la vida de muchos estadounidenses. Y tampoco está claro que atribuir el alto costo de vida al ""aumento de precios de Putin"" lo esté sacando de su aprieto político.

""En última instancia, la administración, cuando se trata de la inflación, debe dejar de decir que no puede hacer nada al respecto, ¿verdad? Esa suele ser una de las pistas para decir que no es culpa nuestra"", dijo Will Hurd, un excongresista republicano de Texas, en el programa ""State of the Union"" de CNN el domingo.

""Nadie quiere escuchar eso. Y quieren decir: 'Oye, ¿cómo nos vas a sacar de esto?'"".

Mientras tanto, The New York Times informó este domingo que Biden fue advertido repetidamente en una serie de memorandos de encuestas confidenciales que la inflación y el irritante tema de la inmigración erosionarían su posición y las esperanzas de los demócratas en las elecciones de mitad de período. Los memorandos, escritos entre abril de 2021 y enero de 2022, se obtuvieron al informar sobre eln nuevo libro, ""Esto no pasará: Trump, Biden y la batalla por el futuro de Estados Unidos"", de los reporteros del Times Alex Burns y Jonathan Martin.

""Los votantes no sienten que tenga un plan para abordar la situación en la frontera, y están empezando a pasar factura"", escribió en un memorando John Anzalone, el principal encuestador de Biden, y su equipo, según el informe de The New York Times.

Juez de EE.UU. impide temporalmente derogar el Título 42 2:06

Biden se burla de su propio índice de aprobación

Fue en este contexto que Biden se puso de pie en el gran salón de baile del hotel Washington Hilton el sábado por la noche y bromeó: ""Un agradecimiento especial al 42% de ustedes que realmente me aplaudieron. Estoy realmente emocionado de estar aquí esta noche con el único grupo de estadounidenses con un índice de aprobación más bajo que el mío"".

Que el evento se llevara a cabo fue evidencia de uno de los éxitos de la presidencia de Biden: la cantidad de vacunas y pruebas de detección de covid que les han permitido a muchos estadounidenses recuperar una apariencia de sus antiguas vidas dos años después de que el coronavirus cerrara la economía y cambiara el mundo. El presidente también puede atribuirse el mérito de un raro triunfo bipartidista: una ley de infraestructura que eludió a sus predecesores. Y su liderazgo ayudó a construir una respuesta occidental inesperadamente unificada a la invasión rusa de Ucrania, lo que puede haber ayudado a mitigar parte del daño político de la caótica evacuación estadounidense de Afganistán el año pasado.

Sin embargo, estos logros no resuenan en el público o la Casa Blanca no logró unirlos en una narrativa electoral coherente. Las dificultades que ha enfrentado Biden para promulgar su vasto plan climático y de gasto social, que ha sido bloqueado por los senadores demócratas moderados Kyrsten Sinema de Arizona y Joe Manchin de Virginia Occidental, se han sumado a la sensación de deriva.

Si Biden se equivocó al impulsar una agenda de reforma radical que, según algunos críticos, no estaba implícita en su campaña de 2020, o si la Casa Blanca no logró vender propuestas como la atención médica domiciliaria para ancianos y educación preescolar gratuita en el vasto proyecto de ley Build Back Better, Biden se ha visto privado de la gran victoria en una medida que alguna vez se comparó con el New Deal del presidente Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Aún parece profundamente incierto si alguno de los planes de Biden se promulgará, y el tiempo se agota rápidamente antes de que la campaña para las elecciones intermedias domine el verano político. El estancamiento amenaza con apagar el entusiasmo entre los votantes de base demócratas en noviembre, al mismo tiempo que el Partido Republicano está realizando una campaña arraigada en posiciones extremas sobre temas como los derechos de las personas trans, la inmigración y la enseñanza de la raza en las escuelas de Estados Unidos para aumentar la participación entre sus votantes más comprometidos. El Partido Republicano está superponiendo esos temas con afirmaciones diseñadas para atraer a los votantes más moderados de que los altos precios de los alimentos y la gasolina muestran que Biden ha arruinado la economía.

El estancado plan Build Back Better también ha provocado indicios de acritud dentro del Partido Demócrata. La senadora Elizabeth Warren de Massachusetts, una de las principales progresistas, advirtió en el programa ""State of the Union"" de CNN la semana pasada que los demócratas perderían su mayoría si ""no se levantan y cumplen"".

Biden ha estado bajo presión para cumplir una promesa de campaña de reducir la carga de la deuda estudiantil después de extender repetidamente una pausa de la era Trump de los pagos de préstamos estudiantiles federales debido a la pandemia. Pero perdonar US$ 50.000 en deuda por prestatario, algo que Warren ha pedido, no está sobre la mesa, dijo el presidente en la Casa Blanca la semana pasada después de revelar una solicitud de millones de dólares más en asistencia para Ucrania. Biden no ha dejado en claro si usaría el poder ejecutivo para proporcionar de inmediato un alivio masivo de la deuda.

Los comentarios de Warren contenían más que un indicio de un juego de culpas postelectoral siete meses antes de que los votantes vayan a las urnas. Sin embargo, no cambian el hecho de que la pequeña mayoría demócrata en el Senado 50-50 significa que Biden no tiene la capacidad técnica para convertir gran parte de su agenda en ley.

Si bien Biden le restó importancia a su posición política el sábado por la noche, se quejó en privado de que los medios no se han centrado en la comparación entre su presidencia y la anarquía y los escándalos que definieron el mandato de Trump, informaron la semana pasada Edward-Isaac Dovere y Kevin Liptak de CNN.

Existe la posibilidad de que el impulso de Trump para que los candidatos repitan sus mentiras de fraude electoral radica en que las primarias republicanas de este mes permitan a Biden desarrollar ese tema en su propia campaña para las elecciones intermedias. Pero como demostró la victoria de gobernador del republicano Glenn Youngkin en Virginia en noviembre pasado, los demócratas ya no pueden contar con una feroz campaña contra Trump cuando el expresidente no está en la boleta electoral.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/analisis-elecciones-intermedias-entorno-politico-terrible-democratas-puede-empeorar-trax/

(CNN Español) -- No he vuelto a escribir desde la invasión de Rusia a Ucrania porque no sentía necesario enumerar todos los problemas que todos conocemos. Lo que un analista intenta lograr es dar sentido a esos hechos con el propósito de contribuir con ideas para solucionarlos, evitarlos y adaptarnos para avanzar.



Lo de fondo es que la sociedad no ha tenido un descanso de esta secuencia de graves crisis desde que comenzó la pandemia. Por momentos, pensábamos que eran exageraciones de una sociedad más interconectada, sobre todo con las redes sociales. Al fin y al cabo, la tecnología nos ayudó a subsistir y manejar el covid-19, pero las redes sociales, con su tendencia a polarizar y agrupar entre los extremos, continúan minando importantes pilares de la sociedad: sobre todo los de la democracia.

Viven bajo tierra en Járkiv: el relato de fotoperiodista en Ucrania 1:24

Con la pandemia vino también la disrupción de la cadena de suministros de productos y el agravamiento de la inflación. Con la invasión despiadada de Rusia a Ucrania y la subsecuente subida del precio del petróleo (y sobre todo, de los precios del gas para los europeos), la inflación se agravó aún más.

Ahora, la política de cero covid en Shanghái y otras ciudades de China agravará aún más la cadena de suministros y, por supuesto, la inflación. La Reserva Federal continuará subiendo las tasas de interés para paliar estos efectos, y aumentan las perspectivas de descenso en los pronósticos de crecimiento económico de este país, porque también debemos considerar los efectos de la pandemia en el crecimiento económico de China.

Toda esta secuencia nos lleva a pronosticar que este año será también muy difícil: incluyendo las elecciones de mitad de periodo en EE.UU. Siempre la oposición (en este caso, los republicanos) tiende a responsabilizar de todos los problemas al presidente, mientras que los partidarios del Gobierno (en este caso, los demócratas) tienden a responsabilizar de estos problemas a la comunicación del Gobierno. Pero la verdad de los hechos es exactamente eso: hechos y no palabras. Es muy difícil ser popular cuando hay inflación, inseguridad y bajo crecimiento.

EE.UU. y Europa están haciendo lo correcto, que es corregir los malos años de haber aupado a Putin, ayudando a financiar con los pagos de su factura energética (sobre todo la del gas) a un Gobierno totalmente corrupto y con ello, armar un ejército listo para invadir y tratar de cambiar, con su paranoia e ínfulas zaristas, las fronteras de Europa.

Se vive un infierno en la planta siderúrgica de Mariúpol 3:52

Corregir años de esos errores en política energética internacional no será fácil y el mayor costo lo siguen pagando los ucranianos, que combaten en la primera fila de esta guerra para impedir las intenciones imperialistas de Putin.

“En política se tiene que comer muchos sapos” decía un viejo político mexicano (Adolfo Ruiz Cortines). Por eso coincido en la propuesta del analista de CNN, Fareed Zakaria, de que EE.UU y Europa deben buscar una alianza real con Arabia Saudita para inyectar aún más petróleo en el mercado y conseguir bajar su precio. La dependencia del gas será más compleja ,como lo dijo Gita Gopinath, del FMI, pero hay que comenzar a trabajar en una nueva ecuación energética en Europa para no tener que volver a confiar en un vecino como Putin y quizás en la misma política rusa.

Putin ejemplifica lo fatal que pueden ser los Gobiernos autoritarios, concentradores del poder y las dictaduras. La democracia y sobre todo, la libertad de expresión hacen crecer a sus Gobiernos porque les dan información a sus gobernantes, que muchas veces no quieren escuchar o no están dispuestos a admitir.

Para mí, China tiene una estructura política más compleja y más avanzada que la de Rusia. No es gobernada por un dictador propiamente dicho, sino por el dominio de un partido único. En tal sentido, también le falta esa capacidad de reflexión que generalmente viene de fuera del Gobierno central. Solo así China podría cuestionarse el enorme costo que puede significar continuar con esa política cero contra el covid-19. Pero como en casi todo lo que ha sucedido en esta pandemia, habido más política que verdadero análisis independiente y profesional. Temo que China continuará con su política de cero covid en Shanghái con graves consecuencias logísticas, económicas y sociales. Así como muchos no quisieron entrar en esa discusión por ser una materia muy sensible y personal: tampoco lo hará Xi Jinping por razones políticas.

Económica y políticamente, pienso que este año está bastante perdido. ¿Cómo será el próximo? Lo sabremos muy probablemente en pocas semanas si Putin no logra conquistar Odesa y fuera forzado a un acuerdo, y si la pandemia no se complica más en China (o aún peor, en el resto del mundo). Solo así podremos tener un buen 2023.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/29/opinion-tiempos-dificiles/

(CNN Español) -- La noche de este lunes se lleva a cabo el evento que en Estados Unidos busca recaudar fondos para el Instituto de Vestimenta del Museo Metropolitano de Arte de la ciudad de Nueva York, conocido como Met Gala.

Es una ceremonia que la directora editorial de la revista Vogue México y Latinoamérica, Karla Martínez de Salas, califica como el “Superbowl” de la moda, o la noche del “Oscar” de la moda.

Zona Pop habló con ella al respecto durante el evento Espacio Vogue, en la Ciudad de México.

""Es el evento del año, y este año regresa de nuevo a ser en mayo, el primer lunes de mayo. El año pasado, por la pandemia, fue en septiembre, y fue un evento más chico. Ahora estamos muy emocionados por lo que vamos a ver este lunes"", asegura Martínez de Salas.

Este año, el tema de la alfombra roja es el ""Gilded glamour"", así que los asistentes encarnarán la grandeza de Nueva York del período de tres décadas a finales del siglo XIX, conocido de esa manera.

""Sí, este año lleva como nombre The Gilded Age, lo cual se me hace súper interesante porque si piensas en esta época en la que la gente gastaba y compraba ropa, joyería y relojes, creo que vamos a ver mucha joya, vamos a ver muchas lentejuelas y diamantes, y todo lo que lo que piensas cuando piensas en la época del ‘Gilded Age’"", afirma Karla.

El tema central de la exhibición de la Met Gala: la moda estadounidense, segunda parte

El objetivo principal de este evento no es que las celebridades paguen cerca de US$ 30.000 por boleto y desfilen por las escaleras del Museo Metropolitano de Arte con vestidos llamativos. Se busca recaudar fondos para el Instituto de Vestimenta de dicho museo, con una exhibición que dura un año.

""El tema de este año es una continuación de lo que vimos en septiembre, que es American Fashion. Es el léxico de la moda norteamericana vista a través de los ojos de diversos diseñadores. La de este año, la segunda parte, lleva el nombre de ""In America: An Anthology of Fashion"", detalla Martínez de Salas.

""A mí me encanta, porque cuando estás hablando de diseñadores americanos, están presentes en la exhibición nombres como María Cornejo, Willy Chavarría, Jonathan Cohen, Donna Karan, Carolina Herrera y Calvin Klein, pero me encanta ver que ahora hay muchísimos diseñadores latinos en la exhibición, que son diseñadores americanos"", agrega.

""En un momento destacado de la exhibición está un vestido que era una bandera americana que hizo Willy Chavarría, un diseñador chicano de Los Ángeles de padres mexicanos que lleva dos años como director creativo de Calvin Klein. Sentí padrísimo porque está cambiando la moda en Estados Unidos y también cambiando lo que decimos de la belleza"", comenta.

Eiza González, Maluma y J Balvin con invitación confirmada a la Met Gala

Se comenta que Anna Wintour es quien decide a quién se invita a esta celebración. El año pasado, quien deslumbró por su belleza en un vestido rojo de Versace, con joyas de Bulgari y evocando con su look a María Félix fue Eiza González.

¿Qué otros latinos estarán presentes este año?

""Los que sé con seguridad que están invitados son Eiza, Maluma, J Balvin y su novia Valentina Ferrer, que es argentina, Bad Bunny y Rosalía. Espero ver a alguien como Ariana de Bose, la puertorriqueña que ganó el Oscar. Me encanta ver que ahora hay más representación latina en este evento, cuando antes había poca"", señala Martínez de Salas.

¿Cómo es trabajar con Anna Wintour?

Hay muchas historias de cómo es trabajar con Anna Wintour. Existe la leyenda urbana de que “The Devil Wears Prada” (""El diablo viste a la moda"", en español) está basada en ella, pero ¿cómo es en realidad trabajar con la periodista más importante de la moda?

""La verdad es que es una mujer muy enfocada, súper profesional. Yo puedo decir que siempre la he admirado mucho, desde ser asistente, porque es una mamá, esposa, tiene hijos, tiene nietos y se me hace increíble lo que ha hecho con Vogue"", dice Martínez de Salas.

""La dirección en la que ha llevado al Met al final en recaudar fondos. Todo lo que ha hecho para el museo para el Costume Institute, para los diseñadores, especialmente los diseñadores americanos, pues es súper importante"", agrega.

""Es alguien que toma decisiones rápidas, es una profesional y siento que siempre se acuerda de quién trabaja y cómo trabajan, y da mucho crédito donde ha merecido"", concluye.

¿Volverá Eiza González a deslumbrar como lo hizo en 2021?

¿Quién crees que vista el traje de la época dorada de Nueva York con mayor elegancia?

¿Quién portará el traje más llamativo de la alfombra roja de la Met Gala inspirado en la “Golden Age”?

184,¿Saliendo del encierro? Consejos de moda y belleza para un mundo después del aislamiento,"ARod genera debate en las redes por patrocinar producto 1:24

(CNN) -- A lo largo de la pandemia, muchos de nosotros hemos soñado con cómo sería la vida una vez que el mundo empiece a recuperarse. Mientras nos enfrascamos en nuestros conjuntos de descanso y cambiamos el maquillaje por el cuidado de la piel, fantaseamos con lo ordinario: nuestro primer corte de pelo, el próximo conjunto para una cita nocturna, el uso de lápiz labial sin que se nos corra por toda la mascarilla.

En muchas partes del mundo los cierres empiezan a suavizarse. Países como el Reino Unido y Francia son algunos de los que van a reabrir con cautela en las próximas semanas, mientras que en Estados Unidos, estados desde California hasta Nueva York han levantado ya las restricciones.

Y a medida que la gente se reincorpora a la sociedad, muchos de nosotros estamos revaluando nuestra relación con la moda y la belleza.

Mucho ha cambiado en el último año. Las previsiones de estilo se dejaron de lado, a medida que la comodidad y la facilidad sustituyeron al glamour y la frivolidad. Pero mientras nuestra vida social se redujo, también lo hizo la presión por tener un determinado aspecto, según la psicóloga de la moda Dawnn Karen.

""Antes (buscábamos) la validación externa, mirando a los que controlan la puerta para determinar lo que ponemos en nuestro cuerpo a diario"", dijo en una entrevista telefónica. ""Ahora nos miramos a nosotros mismos"".

Para ayudarte a navegar por el mundo exterior, hemos pedido a cinco expertos que nos den consejos para salir del refugio contra el covid-19 con confianza.

Vístete con alegría

Una serie de tendencias de moda emergentes pueden relacionarse directamente con nuestra salud mental, dice Karen. La moda puede utilizarse para reflejar o levantar tu estado de ánimo, y el renovado interés por el llamado ""vestirse con dopamina"" habla de esto último. Los colores brillantes, los símbolos de caras sonrientes y el volumen juguetón pueden ayudar a ""optimizar el estado de ánimo"", según Karen.

Al igual que perderse en un buen libro o ver una película alegre, llevar ciertas prendas puede representar una forma de escapismo.

Señalando el actual resurgimiento de los estilos de los años 2000 y 1970, Karen señaló que vestirse con nostalgia es otra forma de curación.

Los años 70 eran ""indicativos de paz, amor y felicidad"", dijo, mientras que la moda de los años 90 se definía por su ""comportamiento fresco, atrevido y despreocupado"".

""Es una forma de controlar nuestro dilema actual, nuestra realidad actual, en la que no sabemos si el covid se acerca o se va, si vamos a salir de la pandemia o no"", dijo: ""¿Por qué no volver a estos tiempos?"".

Pero además de vestirse para ""mejorar el estado de ánimo"", como lo llama Karen, algunos recurren a la ""ilustración del estado de ánimo"", es decir, utilizan la moda para expresar cómo se sienten. Vestirse de una manera que complemente tus emociones puede llevarte a usar ropa de descanso y prendas deportivas cuando te sientas zen, priorizando la comodidad y la calma sobre un estilo llamativo.

""Hay personas que se visten para ser felices y otras que se visten para estabilizar su estado de ánimo"", dice Karen, y añade: ""Hay que tumbarse en la cama (al levantarse) y preguntarse simplemente: '¿Cómo me siento hoy? Y luego determinar: ¿Quieres vestirte para mejorar tu estado de ánimo? ¿O quieres vestirte para estabilizar tu estado de ánimo?"".

Por ejemplo, si te levantas sintiéndote un poco frágil emocionalmente, ¿por qué no te vistes pensando en la comodidad? Prueba con tejidos suaves y relajantes al tacto, como la seda o el lino, y opta por siluetas que no restrinjan tus movimientos. Un vestido suelto de seda o algodón en un color alegre puede ser la solución.

Explora tu lado creativo

Según Marvin Osifo, estilista personal con sede en Sydney, Australia, los hombres también se están volviendo ""más creativos"" con su moda, saliendo de su encierro con salpicaduras de color, estampados y más accesorios. También ha observado un cambio hacia marcas más aventureras, ya que los compradores hacen caso a los llamamientos de la época de la pandemia para apoyar a las empresas locales e invertir en marcas de nicho en lugar de las marcas de moda rápida más obvias.

""El cierre dio a los hombres tiempo para revisar su armario"", dijo por correo electrónico. ""Entonces empezaron a pensar en (formas de) actualizar su guardarropa, con algunos estilos, colores y presentación general nuevos"".

Osifo instó a la gente a alejarse de los básicos y, en su lugar, a ""ampliar sus estilos de colores o patrones, así como a abrazar nuevas prendas que no hayan usado antes"". Las camisas de fibras naturales, en lugar de las sintéticas, son una norma para los meses más calurosos, pues los materiales menos transpirables, como el nailon y el poliéster, tienden a atrapar la humedad y provocar manchas de sudor, añadió.

Vestirse para las nuevas realidades

Las personas que regresan a su lugar de trabajo pueden tener que equilibrar estas consideraciones con otras normas y expectativas. Pero las cosas pueden haber cambiado notablemente desde la última vez que se preparó para el trabajo, dijo Karen, quien sugirió que la vestimenta de oficina tal como la conocemos cambiará drásticamente. ""Creo que los códigos de vestimenta serán más laxos"", dijo.

""Se acabará el estilo de traje y corbata de Wall Street"", continuó, y predijo un cambio hacia el ""estilo de Silicon Valley"", con capuchas de Mark Zuckerberg y todo.

La estilista Josephine Eve aconsejó refrescar lo que se sabe sobre ""el código de vestimenta y las normas"" exigidas en el lugar de trabajo. Las expectativas pueden ser ahora más relajadas de lo que recuerdas. Además de estar atento a las elecciones de los compañeros, echar un vistazo a los estantes de las marcas de moda corporativa, muchas de las cuales han adoptado elementos de athleisure, ropa de descanso y vestimenta casual en colecciones recientes, puede ayudarte a navegar por la nueva normalidad.

Añadir piezas llamativas a los estilos monocromáticos es otra forma de llevar tu personalidad al trabajo, sugiere Eve. Pero siempre hay que ""adaptar los atuendos a la situación"", advirtió la estilista con sede en Sydney, añadiendo que a algunos de sus clientes les ha resultado difícil salir de su zona de confort de la moda pandémica.

""Tras los confinamientos, mucha gente se quedó atrapada en una 'rutina de estilo', en la que les resultaba difícil salir de su cómoda ropa 'segura' para entrar de nuevo en territorio desconocido"", dijo Eve, y añadió: ""Todos hemos pasado por muchos cambios (debido al) covid, y el cambio realmente puede evolucionar y alterar nuestro estilo personal"".

Para quienes no sepan por dónde empezar, Eve recomendó experimentar con estilos de mezclilla acampanados y rectos, con tonos neutros de moda como el crema, el avena o el chocolate, y con la ""combinación de tonos"" (llevar un conjunto del mismo color pero en tonos diferentes). Eve también sugirió despojar el armario de las prendas que ""aportan emociones negativas"".

Y no solo nuestros lugares de trabajo pueden haber cambiado, sino también nuestros cuerpos. Tanto Eve como Osifo dijeron que los clientes han tenido que ajustarse a sus formas corporales cambiantes, y este último dijo que esto se aplica tanto a los que ganaron como a los que perdieron peso durante el cierre. Para las mujeres, Eve recomendó invertir en vestidos envolventes, piezas que ""rozan y no se pegan al cuerpo"" y prendas hechas con ""telas elásticas y estructuradas que tienen elastano (licra)"".

""No importa cuál sea tu forma, o cómo se vea tu cuerpo en este momento, abraza lo que tienes. Y aprende a favorecer la forma y el tamaño de tu cuerpo en el momento presente, en lugar de desear y esperar ese 'cuerpo perfecto' (antes) de comprar ropa"".

Maquillaje limpio y sencillo

Los bolsos de maquillaje quedaron intactos durante el encierro, y muchos de nuestros regímenes de belleza se limitaron a aplicar el corrector para ir al supermercado o a las reuniones de Zoom. Incluso cuando nos aventuramos a salir de nuevo, el enfoque de ""menos es más"" puede perdurar, según la maquilladora de celebridades Joy Adenuga, que cuenta entre sus clientes a la creadora de ""I May Destroy You"", Michaela Coel.

En Londres, Reino Unido, donde se ha restablecido la normalidad en las últimas semanas, la gente ha adoptado un estilo de belleza minimalista, según Adenuga. La gente opta por un ""maquillaje limpio y sencillo"", añadió, y muchas de sus clientas dan prioridad al cuidado de la piel y piden acudir a dermatólogos.

""Ahora que las restricciones han comenzado a levantarse, estamos experimentando con el maquillaje de nuevo, aunque con cautela"", continuó, diciendo que había ""todavía una sensación de inquietud en el aire"".

""Todavía no estamos preparadas para ir a tope de glamour por las calles de Londres"".

Según Adenuga, el ""glamour natural"" está a la orden del día, con ""un énfasis en el maquillaje de ojos y un toque de color en las mejillas"".

Consejos de una experta para usar maquillaje y mascarilla 1:06

Adenuga recomendó utilizar cremas hidratantes con color y correctores más ligeros que bases de maquillaje de gran cobertura para los próximos meses de verano. En Londres, por ejemplo, la gente acudió a los parques con ""mejillas doradas y brillantes, complementadas con colorete"" en tonos más oscuros, como el cereza y el ciruela, así como el melocotón, el coral y el albaricoque, explicó la maquilladora.

Aunque las ventas de lápiz labial se desplomaron durante la pandemia, parece que la gente vuelve a recurrir a él. El minorista británico Escentuals informó de un aumento del 85% en la demanda en mayo de 2021, volviendo a los ""niveles prepandémicos"", según la publicación del sector Fashion Network. Una tendencia similar se observa también en EE.UU., donde la empresa de investigación IRI observó un aumento del 80% en las ventas de lápiz labial en abril, en comparación con el mismo periodo del año anterior.

Según Adenuga, hay que elegir tonos de labios resistentes a las manchas y a las mascarillas. Y se puede conseguir un estilo discreto con lápiz labial mate en ""tonos neutros más suaves como el marrón, el topo y el nude"", añadió.

Adenuga también dijo que las cejas son ""más gruesas y naturales"" que antes de la pandemia, posiblemente debido al cierre de los salones de belleza en muchos lugares durante los confinamientos, mientras que las cejas ""pluma"" también se han convertido en una opción popular. (Adenuga dice que usar ""geles para cejas con una punta pequeña"" es la mejor manera de domar los pelos de las cejas despeinadas).

Y antes de volver a echar mano de las paletas de sombras de ojos, Adenuga también recomendó realizar una ""auditoría de belleza"" de tu colección y tirar todo lo que haya caducado.

Refresca y reactiva tu cabello

En los lugares donde se han reabierto las peluquerías, los estilistas han sido bombardeados con citas para recortar los mechones rebeldes de la pandemia, o incluso para arreglar algún que otro desastre capilar inspirado en TikTok.

En Hong Kong (donde el miedo al virus, más que las restricciones legales, mantuvo a la gente alejada de los salones), los clientes que regresaban a menudo se encontraban ""confundidos o perdidos"" sobre lo que debían hacer con su cabello, dijo Marvin Lin, director creativo de Shhh Salon.

La investigación en línea solo puede ayudar hasta cierto punto. Consultar a un estilista profesional en persona suele ser la mejor manera de obtener recomendaciones adaptadas a la forma de tu cara y a las tendencias actuales, dijo Lin, y añadió: ""Estamos en muy buena posición para (dar) consejos"".

Ella recomendó estilos más cortos, que no solo son adecuados para los meses más calurosos, sino que también te permiten literalmente ""cortar el último año"". Como el pelo suele crecer 15 centímetros al año, un corte grande ayudará a ""refrescar y reiniciar"" tu imagen, explicó.

Los efectos del covid-19 en el cabello 0:50

Lin fue testigo de una buena cantidad de crisis capilares durante la pandemia, muchas de las cuales se debieron a la tendencia de usar tintes en casa. Teñirse el pelo en un salón de belleza en lugar de hacerlo en nuestra bañera tiene una serie de ventajas, ya que los estilistas profesionales suelen hacer pruebas en el pelo para asegurarse de que se consigue el color exacto. Lin afirma que en los salones se toman otras precauciones para proteger el cabello y el cuero cabelludo de los clientes.

""Sin esas medidas adecuadas, el pelo, la textura, se estropea totalmente y se vuelve áspero"", explica. ""Y por no mencionar que (la gente) no pudo conseguir el color que pretendía"".

Lin sugirió que los que experimentan sensibilidad y daños en el cabello deberían probar una ""desintoxicación del cuero cabelludo"" para limpiar la piel sin quitarle sus aceites naturales.

A pesar de los experimentos realizados con colores de neón y puntas escarchadas al estilo de las bandas de los 90, algunos de nosotros volveremos a los peinados más adecuados para la oficina en los próximos meses. Una forma de mantener la creatividad es un peinado que Lin llama ""No lo cuentes"", que consiste en teñir estratégicamente una sección inferior del cabello con un tono brillante que pueda ocultarse fácilmente cuando te dejes el pelo suelto. Las mechas en contraste son otra buena forma de hacerlo, dice.

Pero, según Karen, muchas de las ""reglas estrictas"" tácitas a las que antes nos ateníamos han quedado ""obsoletas"". Tanto si llevamos color en el pelo como si nos vestimos para estar cómodos, hemos desarrollado una nueva relación con nuestra apariencia, ""y a su vez"", añadió, ""hemos desarrollado una nueva relación con nosotros mismos"".",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/06/22/saliendo-encierro-consejos-moda-belleza-mundo-despues-aislamiento-trax/

(CNN) — Hay un desacuerdo cada vez mayor entre algunas de las principales estrellas del tenis mundial y sus colegas ucranianos, tanto actuales como anteriores, ante la decisión de Wimbledon de impedir que los competidores de Rusia y Belarús puedan participar debido a la invasión rusa de Ucrania.

Al explicar su postura, Wimbledon señaló que no quería ""beneficiar a la maquinaria de propaganda del régimen ruso"".

Sin embargo, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray y Novak Djokovic ––quienes han ganado 10 títulos de Wimbledon entre ellos–– se unieron a la Asociación de Tenistas Profesionales (ATP) y a la Asociación Femenina de Tenis (WTA, por sus siglas en inglés) en su oposición al veto.

""Creo que es muy injusto (para) mis compañeros de tenis rusos, mis colegas"", dijo Nadal durante una conferencia de prensa este domingo antes del Abierto de Madrid. ""No es su culpa lo que está pasando en este momento con la guerra"", añadió.

""Lo siento por ellos, Wimbledon simplemente tomó su decisión... El gobierno no los obligó a hacerlo. Veremos qué pasa en las próximas semanas, si los jugadores toman algún tipo de decisión al respecto"", insistió.

Los tenistas ucranianos han apoyado en gran medida la prohibición de Wimbledon. En ese sentido, Sergiy Stakhovsky, quien se retiró a principios de este año y se unió al Ejército de Ucrania para defender su país, rechazó la postura de Nadal.

""@RafaelNadal competimos juntos... Nos hemos enfrentado en el tour"", escribió Stakhovsky en Twitter.

""Por favor, dime cómo es justo que los jugadores ucranianos no puedan regresar a casa. ¿Cómo es justo que los niños ucranianos no puedan jugar al tenis? ¿Cómo es justo que los ucranianos se estén muriendo?"", continuó.

Varios tenistas de alto perfil no podrán competir en Wimbledon

Wimbledon: los tenistas rusos y bielorrusos afectados 1:21

La decisión del club All England Lawn Tennis (AETLC, por sus siglas en inglés) marca la primera vez que los atletas rusos y bielorrusos son excluidos de un evento de tenis de élite, luego de que Moscú lanzara su invasión a Ucrania.

En ese sentido, varios jugadores de alto perfil no podrían competir. Entre ellos, el número 2 del mundo masculino, Daniil Medvedev, y la número 4 del mundo femenino, Aryna Sabalenka.

Murray, quien donará todo el dinero de sus premios de esta temporada a esfuerzos de ayuda humanitaria en Ucrania, dijo que ""no apoyaba"" el plan para impedir que los jugadores rusos y bielorrusos participaran en Wimbledon. Pero, agregó que no había una ""respuesta correcta"" a la compleja situación.

""Lo que entiendo de la medida es que los rusos y los bielorrusos pueden jugar si firman una declaración de que están en contra de la guerra y contra el régimen ruso"", dijo a periodistas en el Abierto de Madrid.

""No estoy seguro de cuán cómodo me sentiría si algo les sucediera a los jugadores o a sus familias (como resultado de eso)"", añadió.

Djokovic: ""No apoyo la decisión""

En los días posteriores a la invasión a Ucrania, el parlamento de Rusia aprobó una ley que impone penas de cárcel de hasta 15 años por difundir intencionalmente noticias ""falsas"" sobre el Ejército. Lo que aumenta en gran medida los riesgos de que los rusos se pronuncien contra la guerra.

Mientras tanto, Djokovic se refirió a su exclusión del Abierto de Australia por no estar vacunado contra el covid-19, cuando se opuso al veto de Wimbledon por segunda vez.

""No es lo mismo. Pero, pasar por algo similar a principios de este año, es frustrante saber que no puedes jugar"", dijo Djokovic.

""Todavía mantengo mi posición de que no apoyo la decisión (de Wimbledon). Creo que no es justo, no está bien, pero es lo que hay"", añadió.

Tras las críticas del mundo del tenis, la AELTC defendió su decisión en una rueda de prensa la semana pasada.

""Incluso si aceptáramos inscripciones de jugadores rusos y bielorrusos con declaraciones escritas, correríamos el riesgo de que su éxito o participación en Wimbledon se utilizara para beneficiar a la maquinaria de propaganda del régimen ruso. Algo que no podríamos aceptar"", dijo el presidente del torneo, Ian Hewitt a reporteros el martes pasado.

Los tenistas afectados aún no han anunciado una respuesta coordinada. Pero, la ATP y la WTA están discutiendo contramedidas que podrían incluir la eliminación de los puntos de clasificación de Wimbledon.

En una entrevista reciente con CNN, la estrella de tenis ucraniana Marta Kostyuk habló sobre el impacto psicológico que ha tenido en ella la invasión de Rusia.

Medvedev enfrentaría obstáculos para jugar en Wimbledon 0:40

""Empecé hace un par de semanas, lo que me ayuda enormemente. Pero ya sabes, a veces llega a cierto punto que da miedo, los pensamientos que te vienen"", dijo Kostyuk, quien es extremadamente consciente de la importancia de tratar de manejar sus sentimientos y dice que ha estado trabajando con un psicólogo.

""No quiero decir las palabras porque ya sabes, puedes entender de qué estoy tratando de hablar"", añadió.

""Porque en ese punto, están sucediendo tantas cosas, necesitas cargar tanto a la vez que piensas, 'ya no puedo con esto'"".

""Estoy como, ¿cuál es el punto al que todo esto llega? Nunca termina, ¿qué debo hacer con mi vida ahora? ¿Para qué estoy viviendo?"", completó.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/wimbledon-nadal-djokovic-tenistas-rusia-belarus-trax/

(CNN) -- La cantidad de horas de sueño óptimas no son mi muy poco ni demasiado, al menos en la mediana edad y en la vejez.

Una nueva investigación ha encontrado que alrededor de siete horas de sueño es el descanso nocturno ideal, ya que un sueño insuficiente o excesivo está asociado con una capacidad reducida para prestar atención, recordar y aprender cosas nuevas, resolver problemas y tomar decisiones.

También se descubrió que siete horas de sueño están relacionadas con una mejor salud mental, ya que las personas experimentan más síntomas de ansiedad y depresión y un peor bienestar general si informan que duermen por períodos más largos o más cortos.

""Si bien no podemos decir de manera concluyente que dormir demasiado o muy poco causa problemas cognitivos, nuestro análisis que estudió a las personas durante un extenso periodo parece indicarlo así"", dijo en un comunicado Jianfeng Feng, profesor de la Universidad Fudan de China y autor del estudio publicado en la revista científica Nature Aging.

""Pero las razones por las que las personas mayores duermen menos parecen ser complejas, y están influenciadas por una combinación de nuestra composición genética y la estructura de nuestros cerebros"".

Investigadores de China y el Reino Unido analizaron datos de casi 500.000 adultos de 38 a 73 años que formaban parte del Biobanco del Reino Unido, un estudio de salud a largo plazo respaldado por el gobierno. Se preguntó a los participantes sobre sus patrones de sueño, salud mental y bienestar, y participaron en una serie de pruebas cognitivas. Se tomaron imágenes del cerebro y datos genéticos de casi todos los 40.000 participantes del estudio.

Otra investigación ha encontrado que los adultos mayores que tienen una dificultad significativa para conciliar el sueño y que experimentan despertares nocturnos frecuentes tienen un alto riesgo de desarrollar demencia o morir prematuramente por cualquier causa, mientras que dormir menos de seis horas por noche se ha relacionado con enfermedades cardiovasculares.

Una de las razones del vínculo entre la falta de sueño y el deterioro cognitivo podría deberse a la interrupción del sueño profundo, que es cuando el cerebro repara el cuerpo del desgaste del día y consolida los recuerdos. Dormir muy poco también está asociado con la acumulación de amiloide, una proteína clave que puede causar enredos en el cerebro que están asociados con alguna forma de demencia. El estudio también dijo que es posible que dormir más horas esté asociado a un sueño fragmentado y de mala calidad.

El Dr. Raj Dasgupta, vocero de la Academia Estadounidense de Medicina del Sueño y profesor asistente de medicina clínica en la Escuela de Medicina Keck de la Universidad del Sur de California, dijo que las duraciones más prolongadas del sueño se han asociado con problemas cognitivos, pero no estaba del todo claro el por qué.

""Esto establece una marca para futuras investigaciones y la búsqueda de un tratamiento"", dijo Dasgupta, que no participó en la investigación. ""El sueño es esencial a medida que envejecemos, y lo necesitamos tanto como las personas más jóvenes, pero es más difícil de obtener"".

El estudio tuvo algunas limitaciones: solo evaluó cuánto tiempo durmieron los participantes en total y ninguna otra medida de la calidad del sueño, como despertarse durante la noche. Además, los participantes informaron la cantidad de sueño que tenían, por lo que no se midió objetivamente. Sin embargo, los autores dijeron que la gran cantidad de personas involucradas en el estudio significaba que sus conclusiones probablemente eran sólidas.

Los autores dijeron que sus hallazgos sugirieron que era importante que el sueño, idealmente de alrededor de siete horas, fuera constante.

Algunos consejos para ayudarte a dormir mejor 6:50

El estudio mostró una relación entre dormir demasiado y muy poco y los problemas cognitivos, no entre causa y efecto, advirtió Russell Foster, profesor de la Universidad de Oxford y director del Instituto de Neurociencia Circadiana y del Sueño Sir Jules Thorn, quien no participó en la investigación. Él dijo que el estudio no había tenido en cuenta el estado de salud de las personas y que dormir poco o mucho tiempo puede ser un indicio de condiciones de salud subyacentes con problemas cognitivos.

También dijo que tomar el promedio de siete horas como la cantidad ideal de sueño ""ignora el hecho de que existe una variación individual considerable en la duración y la calidad del sueño"". Menos o más horas de sueño pueden ser perfectamente saludables para algunas personas, dijo.

""Normalmente se nos dice que la noche 'ideal' de sueño en los ancianos debería ser siete horas de sueño ininterrumpido. Esta creencia es incorrecta en muchos sentidos. El sueño es como el tamaño del zapato; decir que esto es 'dormir bien' puede causar confusión y ansiedad en muchos"", dijo Foster, autor del próximo libro ""Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock, and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health"".

""Cuánto tiempo dormimos, nuestros horarios de sueño preferidos y cuántas veces nos despertamos durante la noche varía enormemente entre individuos y a medida que envejecemos. El sueño es dinámico y todos tenemos diferentes patrones de sueño, y la clave es evaluar las necesidades que tiene nuestro individuo"".",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/cuantas-horas-sueno-recomendable-dormir-salud-trax/

203,Estas fotos poco vistas de la Met Gala muestran a las celebridades soltándose y sin poses,"Lo más destacado de la Met Gala 1:04

(CNN) -- La Met Gala, conocida como la noche más importante de la moda, regresa a su típica programación, el primer lunes de mayo, después de dos años de interrupciones debido a la pandemia de covid-19.

El evento, realizado en el Museo Metropolitano de Arte de la ciudad de Nueva York, coincide con la inauguración de la segunda parte de la exposición, ""Estados Unidos: una antología de la moda"", organizada por el Instituto del Vestuario del museo. A los invitados se les pidió que se vistan con el código de vestuario ""Gilded Glamour and White Tie"", en referencia a la lujosa Edad Dorada, un período de tres décadas a fines del siglo XIX que transformó la infraestructura y la vida social estadounidenses.

Pero la documentación de la ostentosa gala ha cambiado en los últimos años, ya que los fotógrafos se han limitado en gran medida a fotografiar las entradas muy posadas de los asistentes; y las imágenes que provienen del área de prensa estrictamente controlada son pulidas y repetitivas. Para ver a las celebridades soltándose (como lo hizo Bella Hadid y Marc Jacobs reunidos en el baño para fumar, por ejemplo), tendrías que recurrir a las fotos posteriores a la fiesta o a sus feeds de Instagram.

Las imágenes de las galas de antaño atraen por su factor nostalgia y estilo retro, pero también revelan un ambiente más relajado que no se limita a las llegadas a la alfombra roja.

La fotógrafa Rose Hartman, que fotografió la gala durante décadas hasta principios de la década de 2000, recordó por teléfono una época en la que había más libertad para moverse y relacionarse con los asistentes. En 1986, fotografió a la actriz Lynda Carter y a la socialité Blaine Trump mientras se reían.

publicidad

“Estaban tan felices hablando entre ellas en lugar de posar”, dijo Hartman a CNN en 2020. “Siempre que sea posible, trato de capturar a las personas que están entretenidas entre sí”.

El fotógrafo Ron Galella, que ha fotografiado la gala desde 1967, tenía un sistema para capturar las mejores tomas, desde la llegada al guardarropa hasta el piso del museo y la cena. ""Fue fácil tomar fotos adentro"", escribió por correo electrónico en 2020. ""Todo lo que necesitaba para ingresar era una tarjeta de New York Press"". (Cuando los pases de prensa eventualmente se volvieron limitados, hubo años en los que entró de contrabando a través de la entrada de los empleados).

A lo largo de las décadas, desde la primera iteración del evento en 1948, la gala se ha transformado de una elegante fiesta en lugares externos como el Rainbow Room de Manhattan a un espectáculo de moda. Los miembros de la alta sociedad y los artistas han cedido el protagonismo a las celebridades de la lista A, que aparecen en los titulares por cómo eligen interpretar o burlarse del tema de la noche.

El código de vestir en la Met Gala de 2022

El tema de este año se basa en la nueva exposición del Instituto del Traje, como la muestra de dos partes de este año en honor a los diseñadores estadounidenses. Otros temas han incluido ""Camp: Notes on Fashion"" de 2019 y ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"" de 2018.

El cambio en la lista de invitados y la atmósfera se debió en gran parte a un cambio generacional en la visión. En la década de 1970, la editora de Vogue, Diana Vreeland, posicionó la gala como la velada inaugural de las principales exhibiciones del Instituto e invitó a la crème de la crème del mundo de la moda y la sociedad de Nueva York, pero su sucesora, Anna Wintour, ha favorecido a músicos de alto perfil, actores y figuras del entretenimiento, usando boletos de $30.000 para el evento para recaudar millones de dólares cada año.

En 1999, el primer año de Wintour como presidenta del evento, Hartman tomó una fotografía de la editora en jefe de Vogue caminando con el exeditor general André Leon Talley, que falleció a principios de este año. La imagen de ellos es alegre, con ambos editores resplandecientes en sus disfraces y atrapados en el movimiento.

""Me encanta el hecho de que caminan en lugar de estar de pie"", dijo Hartman. ""Me encanta el gesto de su movimiento"".

El vasto archivo de imágenes de Met Gala de Galella, que publicó en un libro en 2019, también muestra los gestos cariñosos entre las celebridades cuando no anticipan el flash de una cámara. En 1983, fotografió a la supermodelo Iman ya la diseñadora Paloma Picasso riéndose mientras el esposo de Picasso se inclinaba para abrazar a la escultural Iman por su cintura. En 1995, atrapó a Christy Turlington aparentemente burlándose de Kate Moss, deslizando un dedo en la espalda peligrosamente escotada del vestido blanco de Moss.

En estos días, la gala puede tomarse a sí misma en serio con su cuidada imagen, pero Galella cree que es un sentimiento universal querer ver a la élite del entretenimiento y la moda bajar la guardia.

""Los vemos en películas, los vemos como superestrellas. Pero quiero verlos como humanos"", dijo anteriormente a Forbes. ""¿Qué tan hermosos son cuando no están actuando?"".",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/05/02/met-gala-fotos-poco-vistas-celebridades-soltandose-no-pose-trax/

208,OPINIÓN | Esperen que Putin haga un gran anuncio el 9 de mayo,"Ucranianas que huyen de la guerra revelan lo que dicen los soldados rusos 3:11

Nota del editor: James Nixey es el director del Programa Rusia-Eurasia de Chatham House, especializado en las relaciones entre Rusia y los demás Estados postsoviéticos. Anteriormente trabajó como reportero de investigación en el Moscow Tribune.

(CNN) -- El 9 de mayo, conocido como el Día de la Victoria en Rusia, el presidente Vladimir Putin tendrá que hacer una exhibición pomposa y muy pública para sugerir que está ganando la guerra en Ucrania.



Sin embargo, después de más de dos meses, la guerra se está desarrollando de forma muy distinta a como lo había previsto Rusia. El 9 de mayo, por tanto, podría ofrecer a Putin la ocasión de declarar una ""victoria"" simbólica sobre Ucrania, una gran demostración de éxtasis patriótico destinada a apuntalar a su audiencia, manipulada y cansada de las sanciones.

La fecha marca el día en que la Alemania nazi se rindió a las fuerzas soviéticas (el día después de su capitulación ante los aliados occidentales, razón por la cual el Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y sus aliados conmemoran la victoria el 8 de mayo).

En un principio, Moscú se asoció con el Berlín nazi para dividir el este de Europa entre los dos regímenes totalitarios. Pero después de que esa asociación terminara con la invasión alemana de la URSS en 1941, la contribución humana soviética para derrotar a Alemania, respaldada por enormes envíos de ayuda alimentaria y equipo militar del Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y Canadá, fue fundamental.

La URSS perdió decenas de millones de soldados y civiles en el transcurso de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, muchos de ellos en las entonces repúblicas soviéticas de Ucrania y Belarús.

Durante todo su régimen, el líder soviético Joseph Stalin mató a más personas, tanto en su propio país como en los territorios ocupados, que Adolf Hitler. Pero hoy en día es un crimen en Rusia recordar esta historia, o comparar las atrocidades cometidas por la Unión Soviética con las de la Alemania nazi. Todavía se colocan flores frescas en la tumba de Stalin en la Plaza Roja, donde se celebra el desfile de la victoria del 9 de mayo.

¿Qué importancia tiene el 9 de mayo para Putin?

Vladimir Putin es un ultranacionalista que no cree que las ambiciones territoriales y políticas de Rusia deban terminar en sus fronteras reconocidas internacionalmente. Los países que conformaban la Unión Soviética, aparte de Rusia, no son considerados soberanos por Rusia, de hecho por la mayoría de los rusos, y especialmente por Putin.

Pero al no disponer de herramientas amistosas para atraer a otros países, Rusia necesita de un ejército poderoso para conservar o recuperar su imperio. El 9 de mayo cumple la función de lucirse ante el público local, intimidar a la oposición y complacer al dictador de turno (a lo largo de los años, todos los secretarios generales del Partido Comunista se presentaron de forma similar en el mausoleo de Lenin en la Plaza Roja reconociendo con satisfacción el poderío militar de Rusia durante su desfile).

Ucrania es un tema profundamente personal para Putin (pero, afortunadamente, para el futuro de Ucrania, aún más personal para los ucranianos). Su ""rebeldía"" es una traición y su propia existencia una aberración histórica, a los ojos del presidente de Rusia. Había que hacer algo con las ambiciones occidentales de Ucrania y, como la diplomacia al estilo ruso (léase: coerción) había fracasado, Putin se sintió obligado a recurrir a métodos más musculosos para ""restaurar la rectitud"".

Lo que no había considerado (y, para ser justos, tampoco lo hicieron la mayoría de los analistas occidentales) fue lo fundamentalmente corrupta e incompetente que se había vuelto la supuestamente modernizada y profesionalizada fuerza de combate rusa.

La heroica resistencia ucraniana merece todo el crédito. Pero no habrían podido lograrlo sin la ayuda involuntaria del Ejército ruso. Mientras tanto, tal es la naturaleza vertical de las estructuras políticas rusas, que seguramente hay poca información precisa que circule entre el resto de las élites de Putin sobre el estado de las cosas.

¿Qué podría significar esto para el curso de la guerra?

Si los analistas occidentales están en lo cierto al afirmar que Putin ha exigido una victoria para el Día de la Victoria, esto significa que los mandos militares rusos necesitan lograr algo, cualquier cosa, después de las humillantes derrotas sufridas en los dos primeros meses de esta guerra.

El intento de tomar Kyiv fue repelido, el buque insignia de la flota rusa fue hundido por un país que carece efectivamente de Marina, y han perdido al menos 15.000 soldados, muchos más que en todas las campañas postsoviéticas anteriores (Chechenia, Georgia, Siria, Ucrania 2014) juntas.

El plan B de Rusia (o más probablemente el plan F o G) es redoblar los esfuerzos y las fuerzas terrestres y centrarse en tomar más del este de Ucrania; y con suerte para el Kremlin, pero mucho menos probable, el resto de la costa del mar Negro.

Que esto pueda hacerse a tiempo para el desfile del 9 de mayo es muy discutible. Los ucranianos siguen recibiendo armamento y la moral es alta, aunque Kyiv controla la información que rodea la guerra y no conocemos el estado real de sus fuerzas armadas. Sin embargo, su mayor desafío (desde el este) está por llegar, y en las próximas semanas se intensificarán los combates a medida que Rusia intenta capturar más terreno en la región de Donbás.

Sin embargo, la cuestión sigue siendo si Moscú tratará de continuar la ofensiva más allá de sus pequeñas ganancias territoriales o si optará por ""congelar"" las posiciones sobre el terreno: atrincherarse en territorio ucraniano y demandar a Ucrania la paz mientras la guerra entra en una nueva fase más estática. Los recientes intentos de desestabilizar Moldova a través de su territorio separatista Transnistria, controlado por Rusia, nos recuerdan que Moscú no se rendirá tan fácilmente.

¿Qué es Transnistria, blanco de recientes bombardeos? 1:11

Ambas partes están maniobrando para conseguir una mejor posición en la mesa de negociaciones cuando llegue ese momento. En términos militares, la guerra podría estar llegando a un punto muerto en las próximas semanas, en el que ninguna de las partes tiene fuerza suficiente para dar un giro a la guerra y lograr una victoria decisiva sobre la otra.

¿Cuál parece ser la estrategia de Putin en Ucrania?

Puede que la táctica de Rusia haya cambiado, pero su estrategia, es decir, su objetivo general, no lo ha hecho. Ese objetivo es asegurarse de que Ucrania deje de ser un país independiente capaz de tomar la decisión de ser europeo y mirar hacia el oeste.

La buena noticia es que no hay forma en que logre ese objetivo. El sometimiento de Ucrania, ya sea físico o político, está ahora para siempre fuera del alcance de Rusia. Rusia no ha actuado lo suficientemente bien en el campo de batalla o en la arena política como para lograrlo. La mala noticia es que Rusia todavía no lo sabe y por eso seguirá enviando a sus propios hombres, y a demasiados ucranianos también, a la muerte.

Rusia sí sabe, al menos, que no se trata únicamente de una guerra contra Ucrania, sino contra el orden internacional basado en normas, del que no se ha beneficiado. Rusia lleva diciendo esto desde hace más de una década. La OTAN también lo sabe, pero se niega a reconocerlo públicamente para evitar que la arrastren al conflicto (otra cosa son las discusiones privadas de la OTAN).

Si se mantienen las sanciones, Europa puede seguir despidiéndose de la energía rusa, y si los inversores extranjeros siguen desanimados, el Kremlin se quedará sin dinero a finales de año, lo que a su vez puede dictar un eventual cambio de política. Pero no antes del 9 de mayo. Ninguno de estos cambios será visible para entonces, ni en el ""progreso"" de la guerra ni a los ojos de los rusos de a pie.

(CNN Español) -- El progreso a sangre y fuego de la ofensiva rusa en la ciudad ucraniana de Mariúpol ha dejado como único reducto de resistencia la siderúrgica Azovstal, ahora rodeada por el ejército invasor. El mando militar ruso ha ofrecido dos veces, el 17 y el 19 de abril, la oportunidad de evacuar a los cerca de 1.000 civiles concentrados allí y perdonarles la vida a los miles de soldados heridos y sitiados en el lugar, con la obvia condición de que depongan las armas. Sin embargo, Kyiv se opuso a la rendición. Gesto arrojado y heroico, pero que prolongaría los bombardeos y los combates en la enorme acería, con 10 kilómetros cuadrados de superficie y kilómetros de pasajes subterráneos diseñados para aguantar una explosión nuclear.



Sin embargo, Putin dijo que decidió no asaltar a los ucranianos en Azovstal, sino mantenerlos sitiados hasta que ""de nuevo pueda ofrecérseles la oportunidad de que se rindan a cambio de sus vidas y de un “tratamiento digno”. (Poco antes de publicar esta nota las autoridades ucranianas dijeron que el hospital dentro de la planta habría sido atacado. CNN no ha confirmado de forma independiente el ataque).

La toma de Mariúpol, importante objetivo desde el inicio de la invasión, constituiría una victoria militar y política para Putin, ya que abriría un corredor terrestre entre Rusia y la península de Crimea a la vez que privaría a Ucrania de un importante puerto y de preciosos recursos industriales. Además, Azovstal, es defendida por el Regimiento Azov, calificado por Rusia de neonazi y principal argumento –pretexto de Moscú– para justificar su invasión de un país soberano.

Pero el sitio de Azovstal, puede definir el curso de la guerra en Ucrania.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, presidente de Turquía, miembro de la OTAN, pero que no se sumó a las sanciones de Occidente a la Federación Rusa, se encuentra en una ardua labor diplomática entre el presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, y Vladimir Putin, para llegar a una evacuación pacífica de los civiles cercados en las profundidades de Azovstal. ¿Quién se podría oponer a eso?

Recordemos que, el 29 de marzo, las delegaciones ucranianas y rusas dialogaron en Estambul, y al salir informaron de los puntos claves discutidos allí: la neutralidad de Ucrania y 15 años para dirimir la situación de Crimea. Ya se vislumbraba una reunión entre Zelensky y Putin, y el final de la guerra.

Lo que sucedió un mes antes de esa fecha, fue relevante: Zelensky les preguntó, uno por uno, a 27 líderes europeos si Ucrania alguna vez pertenecería a la Alianza… pero no obtuvo respuesta, lo que llevó al presidente en combate a declarar públicamente: “Ninguno (de los presidentes) me respondió, todos tienen miedo… pero nosotros no tenemos miedo, ni de combatir a Rusia, ni tampoco de dialogar con Rusia”. Y eso, fue lo que el presidente ucraniano hizo, dialogar a través de sus representantes, con los representantes de Rusia, aquel 29 de marzo.

Pero sucedió que el 1 de abril, apenas tres días después del encuentro en Estambul, se descubre la masacre de Bucha y las conversaciones entre Kyiv y Moscú sufren un súbito resfrío, perjudicando la que podría haber sido una solución pacífica del conflicto.

Ahora, el caso de los civiles amenazados en Azovstal podría traer una nueva oportunidad para la paz. Y eso Erdogan lo sabe. Ha actuado como intermediario, este pasado fin de semana, entre Putin y Zelensky. El lunes, se entrevistó en Ankara con António Guterres, secretario general de las Naciones Unidas, quien viajó el lunes a Moscú a entrevistarse con Putin. Recibió la conformidad de Putin para que la Cruz Roja y personal de la ONU participen en las evacuaciones. Guterres viajó a Kyiv para sostener conversaciones con Zelensky. Es obvio que estamos ante un serio intento de reanudar el diálogo de paz. Erdogan ya propuso, públicamente, una cumbre entre Putin y Zelensky en Turquía.

Hay, sin embargo, intereses contrarios a que se reviva esa posibilidad. Algunos prefieren contar con la beneficiosa lucha simbólica de David contra Goliat. Aunque no todos los países de Europa están de acuerdo con las consecuencias de mantener el conflicto vivo, y prefieren una solución negociada. El presidente de Francia, Emanuel Macron, expresó que no podía suscribir la acusación de genocidio de Joe Biden contra Putin. Macron subrayó que aumentar la intensidad de las palabras no traerá la paz.

Hay conductas variadas en la OTAN respecto a la guerra de Ucrania y la posición de liderazgo de EE.UU. “Los aliados más agresivos, como Polonia, Gran Bretaña y, a veces, Estados Unidos, elevan constantemente la apuesta moral para tratar de avergonzar a países como Alemania, Italia y Turquía, que adoptan un enfoque un poco más moderado”, dijo al diario The Washington Post Jeremy Shapiro, director de Investigaciones del Consejo Europeo de Relaciones Exteriores. Recordemos que el recién elegido por cuarta vez Victor Orban, presidente de Hungría, se entrevistó personalmente con Putin al inicio del conflicto, y ni siquiera permite que las armas para Ucrania pasen por su territorio.

No todos los acuerdos son felices a la hora de confrontar la realidad de una guerra. Moscú alertó el lunes a Washington de que no enviara más armas a Ucrania porque es echar gasolina al fuego. Las sanciones perjudican a todos los países europeos y el conflicto puede escalar. Veremos si aparece otra Bucha en el camino de paz de Erdogan. O si el camino se nos complica al final a todos con una “suculenta” guerra nuclear.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/29/opinion-mariupol-paz-ucrania-jorge-davila-miguel-orix/
210,OPINIÓN | La mano derecha de la reina Isabel: ¿sabes quién es Angela Kelly?,"Nota del editor: Mari Rodríguez Ichaso ha sido colaboradora de la revista Vanidades durante varias décadas. Es especialista en moda, viajes, gastronomía, arte, arquitectura y entretenimiento, productora de cine y columnista de estilo de CNN en Español. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna son exclusivamente suyas. Lee más artículos de opinión en cnne.com/opinion.

(CNN Español) -- Cuando me contaron sobre la gran influencia, y enorme poder, de una señora, de 64 años, llamada Angela Kelly, sobre la reina Isabel II, ¡no podía creerlo y pensé que era una broma!

Y cuando me insistieron que Angela era una de las personas más influyentes de la corte real, yo seguía incrédula. No podía creer que la mejor amiga de la siempre seria y aparentemente poco cariñosa reina fuera esta mujer de orígenes muy humildes que, desde hace 28 años, está a cargo de su ropa, joyas y condecoraciones, teniendo el rimbombante título oficial de “asistenta personal y curadora del vestuario, joyas e insignias de la reina”. Y quien desde hace varios años también diseña su ropa y sus sombreros.



Todo un personaje Angela Kelly, sin duda, además ha escrito dos libros (con permiso total de la soberana), donde cuenta con todo lujo de detalles la vida privada de la reina y su cotidianidad. En sus obras incluye detalles sobre sus rituales en el baño, a la hora del té, sus comidas favoritas, sus aficiones televisivas y mucho más. Y uno de los libros –para coincidir con el cumpleaños 96 de la reina y su 70 aniversario en el trono– ha sido reeditado y puesto al día.

En él explica cómo durante la pandemia se convirtió también en la peluquera de la soberana, lo que la ponía nerviosísima, porque la reina sabe perfectamente cómo quiere su estilismo y Angela terminaba su labor necesitando tomar un trago de gin al llegar a su casa en los jardines del Castillo de Windsor. ¡Ginebra con la que –según ha dicho en otras ocasiones– mezcla con agua y lava los diamantes de la Corona!

Y es que Angela Kelly, quien ha sido condecorada por sus servicios a la Corona en el Palacio de Buckingham, es una de las personas que le resuelve los problemas a la reina, y la soberana en sus años de vejez adora que le hagan la vida fácil. ¡Y, en ello, Angela es una experta!

¿Ejemplos? Conversar muchísimo con la reina, saber escucharla y –¡muy importante!– contarle sobre su vida y su humilde niñez, una forma de vivir con problemas cotidianos que quizás Isabel desconocía y a través de Angela se le han hecho mucho más cercanos.

Y, para mí, aquí está el secreto de su relación, a la reina le encanta conversar con Angela –hija de un trabajador de los muelles de Liverpool– quien trata a la soberana como a una amiga. Esa amistad le proporciona a Angela el poder de decidir sobre muchas cosas como su asistenta personal.

¿Qué dijo el príncipe Harry sobre su encuentro con la reina? 1:04

Asistenta que no solo escoge la ropa que la reina va a llevar, sino que en los últimos años le ha “diseñado” un look de conjuntos más modernos y con colores más vivos, que a la reina le encantan. Esos “diseños” después son confeccionados por las muchas modistas que son parte de la plantilla fija del Palacio, supervisados por Angela. Durante ocasiones especiales, jubileos, etc., la reina a veces tiene que cambiarse de ropa cuatro o cinco veces al día, y Angela debe escogerlo todo, incluyendo los vestidos, guantes, zapatos, bolsos, joyas, condecoraciones, sombreros, ¡y hasta la sombrilla transparente con bieses a juego con el vestido!

Muchos de los conjuntos que llevó en los eventos de su Jubileo y el color rosa que llevó en el sketch de los Olímpicos, con el actor Daniel Craig, eran diseño de Angela. Esta ha comentado que una de las reglas del vestir de la soberana es “no llevar sombrero después de las 6 p.m.” –y siempre llevar su bolso– aunque esté en el palacio, que después de todo es su casa. Por supuesto, los zapatos de la reina (los que mandan a arreglar, cambiar la suela, los tacones, etc.,) no cambian desde hace 50 años y siempre le hacen a mano el mismo estilo en la sencilla compañía Anello & Davide. Igual que sucede con sus bolsos, diseño de Lautner desde hace 70 años. También, a partir del 2019, Angela anunció que la reina no volvería a usar pieles y solo llevaría faux fur.

Algunos medios reportan que en una ocasión la reina comentó que era “como si fuéramos hermanas”.

En la entrevista que dio Angela cuando fue condecorada, dijo que ella y la reina hablan absolutamente “de todo y de nada… Somos como dos mujeres normales, cotilleamos, hablamos de moda, de maquillaje y de joyas… cosas que a las dos nos gustan”.

Angela explica, con un fuerte acento escocés, “la reina y yo nos divertimos mucho pues tiene un sentido del humor muy ingenioso y sabe imitar muy bien los acentos de la gente ¡incluyendo el mío!”.

Isabel II pide que la duquesa de Cornualles sea llamada reina consorte 0:40

Dicen que la reina se entera por Angela de muchos temas que pasan en el país, incluso los que afectan a la familia real. Y cuando Isabel II viaja al Castillo de Windsor, y Angela se hospeda en una casa de servicio en el jardín, la reina camina allí a tomar el té con su amiga-asistenta. Y ahora que la reina tiene una agenda más ligera, su amistad con Angela, quien, para ella, no hace nada mal, se acentúa. Su hermana, la princesa Margarita, era quien le contaba lo que pasaba y la mantenía entretenida y, con su muerte, la reina se quedó muy sola y muy triste. Y ahora, con la muerte del príncipe Felipe, la compañía de Angela ha sido aún mas beneficiosa. Y, ahora, la señora Kelly –quien con permiso de Isabel II escribió “Dressing The Queen: The Jubilee Wardrobe”, un libro sobre la ropa de la reina y sus costumbres– ha tomado ese importante lugar.

De los libros el que más me gusta es “The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe”, donde aparecen testimonios de los hijos y 4 nietos de Angela y revela encantadoras anécdotas de su relación y la de su familia con la reina.

Antes de trabajar para la reina, Angela fue ama de llaves del embajador de Inglaterra en Alemania y chófer del Ejército en el Women’s Royal Army Corps.

En el 1993, comenzó en el palacio –y en el 2001 se convirtió en asistenta personal de la reina y senior dresser. Y su nueva labor de “diseñadora” también ha incluido crear gran parte de la ropa y los sombreros que lleva la reina, que le han valido muchos elogios.

Angela lleva 28 años trabajando para ella y como ha dicho en entrevista: “Espero que la reina y yo podamos envejecer juntas”.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/27/opinion-la-mano-derecha-de-la-reina-isabel-sabes-quien-es-angela-kelly/
211,OPINIÓN | ¿Quiénes serán los primeros en abandonar el Twitter de Elon Musk?,"La razón por la que Twitter aceptó la propuesta de Musk 4:38

Nota del editor: Kara Alaimo, profesora asociada en la Escuela de Comunicación Lawrence Herbert de la Universidad de Hofstra, escribe sobre temas que afectan a las mujeres y las redes sociales. Fue portavoz de asuntos internacionales en el Departamento del Tesoro durante la administración Obama. Síguela en Twitter @karaalaimo. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna pertenecen exclusivamente a la autora.

(CNN) — La historia que el mundo de los negocios siguió ansiosamente durante días llegó a un clímax dramático este lunes: Twitter le dio luz verde a la oferta de compra de Elon Musk en un acuerdo de US$ 44.000 millones, a US$ 54,20 la acción.

Si Musk logra lo que ha propuesto, la venta puede significar la sentencia de muerte para la plataforma. Pero, en el mejor de los casos, también podría motivar la creación de otras redes sociales que sean lugares más seguros y saludables para todos nosotros.

Musk ha señalado abiertamente que cree que Twitter debería ser una plataforma para la mayoría de las expresiones sin restricciones. En una entrevista durante la conferencia TED a principios de este mes, Musk dijo que quería mantener la mayor cantidad posible de discursos legales en la plataforma y no deseaba expulsar usuarios. Aunque, paradójicamente, también mencionó que buscaría tomar medidas estrictas contra el spam y las cuentas falsas conocidas como ""bots"", que si bien son molestas y potencialmente peligrosas también son legales.

Elon Musk en 2001: Estoy un poco cansado de internet 3:26

El mes pasado, Musk tuiteó que ""la libertad de expresión es esencial para una democracia que funcione"". Y, en esa línea, preguntó a los usuarios si ""creen que Twitter se adhiere rigurosamente a este principio"".

Pero anticipo que permitir formas nocivas de ""libertad de expresión"" –como la misoginia y el odio– en Twitter, en realidad tendrá el efecto de silenciar a muchas personas y será desastroso para la red social. Eso se debe a que los usuarios reflexivos no van a seguir utilizando voluntariamente una plataforma que los bombardea con abusos.

Y es probable que las primeras personas en huir sean aquellas que reciben lo peor: mujeres y personas de color. Un estudio que realizó The Economist Intelligence Unit en 2020 encontró que el 38% de las mujeres en todo el mundo han experimentado personalmente amenazas en línea como doxeo (publicación de información privada), hackeo, acoso, desinformación y difamación. Por otro lado, el 85% de las mujeres han presenciado un comportamiento así, de acuerdo a la investigación. Según Naciones Unidas, al menos tres cuartas partes de las víctimas del odio en línea en muchos países son miembros de grupos minoritarios.

Una investigación de Pew señala que, si bien es mucho más probable que las mujeres usen Facebook e Instagram que los hombres, es menos probable que utilicen Twitter y Reddit. Precisamente estas son dos plataformas que se han vuelto famosas por el troleo que allí sucede. (Emily Chang, presentadora de Bloomberg Technology, escribe en su libro Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley que ""el odio cibernético es un problema mucho más grande y visible en Reddit y Twitter que en Facebook e Instagram. Porque mi cuenta de Facebook es privada y tengo que aceptar amigos antes de que puedan interactuar conmigo, casi nunca veo comentarios hirientes"").

Esto me dice que las mujeres ya evitan las redes sociales en las que creen que serán víctimas de abuso. Y, si el abuso empeora, tendrá un efecto profundo en el tipo de discusiones que ocurren en la plataforma.

Los cambios que implementaría Elon Musk en Twitter 0:35

Como señaló la escritora Lindy West en el diario The Guardian, ""el troleo en internet puede parecer un problema que únicamente afecta a cierto subconjunto de personas. Pero, eso solo es verdad si crees que vivir en un mundo sin voces diversas –el discurso público moldeado principalmente por hombres blancos, heterosexuales y sin discapacidad– no afectaría profundamente tu vida"".

Es fácil predecir lo que sucederá ahora. Si Twitter se convierte en un lugar que no es inclusivo y empieza a ganar fama por difundir contenido cuestionable y de odio, las figuras públicas no querrán asociarse con él. Y, en últimas, también dejarán de usarlo.

Solo el 22% de los adultos estadounidenses usan Twitter, según una encuesta de Pew de 2019. Pero, la plataforma ejerce una gran influencia en nuestro discurso público porque muchos políticos, líderes empresariales, celebridades y otras personas de alto perfil la utilizan para compartir sus mensajes. Además, los medios, con frecuencia, informan con entusiasmo lo que allí publican estas figuras. Pero los líderes reflexivos y populares no querrán sufrir el daño que implicaría para su reputación asociarse con una plataforma extrema. Como dije antes, esto ayuda a explicar por qué la red social del expresidente Donald Trump, Truth Social, no ha tenido un gran éxito.

Ya hay personas que están tuiteando información dirigida a aquellos que planean abandonar Twitter y piden (con diferentes niveles de seriedad) que recurran a otras plataformas sociales.

Un resultado positivo que podemos esperar de la compra de Musk es que puede catalizar la creación de redes sociales más cívicas. Como el activista de Internet Eli Pariser tuiteó este martes: ""Solo digo... que no tenemos que hacer que nuestra infraestructura de comunicaciones sea un juguete para multimillonarios inconstantes e irresponsables. Podríamos construir plataformas sociales de servicio público que Elon nunca podría comprar. Y yo creo que lo haremos"".

Cruzo los dedos para que Pariser, o alguien más con una visión de cómo administrar una red social de manera más responsable que Musk, lo lleve a cabo.

Si Musk hace lo que prometió, sospecho que destruirá la plataforma. Pero queda la esperanza de que tenerlo a la cabeza motive la creación de nuevas redes sociales que realmente sirvan al interés público. Si eso sucede, el resultado será devastador para Musk. Pero también una victoria para los usuarios a largo plazo.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/26/twitter-elon-musk-usuarios-opinion-trax/
212,OPINIÓN | Suecia y Finlandia deben entrar cuanto antes en la OTAN,"Revés para Putin: Suecia y Finlandia aceleran su entrada a la OTAN 5:52

(CNN Español) -- Rusia amenaza con desplegar más armas nucleares si Suecia y Finlandia entran en la OTAN. No lo hará. Se trata de un bluf. ¿Para qué Putin puede o quiere arriesgar su poder sobre Rusia? Ya se sabe que el artículo quinto de la OTAN dice, como reza el lema de los mosqueteros, “uno para todos y todos para uno”. Rusia sería minuciosamente destruida si se atreve a lanzar una andanada nuclear contra cualquiera de los dos países.



Solo hay tres países que tienen armas nucleares dentro de la OTAN: Estados Unidos, el Reino Unido y Francia. Estados Unidos puede destruir a Rusia varias veces. (EE.UU. tiene 3.750 ojivas, basta con una sola). Rusia también puede destruir a Estados Unidos varias veces. (Rusia tiene 1.444 ojivas y también basta con una sola). El Reino Unido y Francia tienen unas 225 y 290 ojivas nucleares respectivamente. Les basta y les sobra para devastar a Rusia. Algunas están a bordo de submarinos que pueden sumergirse durante meses a la vez y estar en perpetuo movimiento. Podrían estar en la mirilla Moscú (12,6 millones de habitantes) y San Petersburgo (5,5 millones). Pero también quizás Novosibirsk, Nóvgorod, Kazán y otras ciudades de más de 50.000 habitantes.

Hay dos noticias realmente importantes. Una de ellas es que, como le dijo el periodista investigativo ruso Andrei Soldatov a Erin Burnett de CNN, el general ruso Sergey Beseda ha ido a parar a la prisión Lefortovo. Beseda era el jefe de Inteligencia y se encargaba, entre otras cosas, de mantener contactos oficiales con la CIA. No se sabe si le mintió a Putin, o se trata de un simple chivo expiatorio para tratar de contener la información sobre los problemas en el Servicio Federal de Seguridad, o si es alguien que, finalmente, aparecerá y su misión es desacreditar a los ucranianos, especialmente ahora que afirman que han hundido el buque insignia de la Marina rusa en el mar Negro.

La otra: hace unos años se exilió en Miami un simple soldado cubano de una unidad de tanques rusos en Pinar del Río, muy cerca de La Habana. Hablé con él y me contó que, en una oportunidad, ninguno de los tanques rusos estaba disponible para el combate. Me dijo que a los que parecían mejores les faltaba la batería, pues había sido sustraída para venderla en el mercado negro, donde alcanzaban un buen precio para los desabastecidos tractores.

Creo que hay que buscar una vía de negociación para permitirle a Rusia “salvar la cara”. Esta nueva crisis se parece mucho a aquella. En octubre de 1962, cuando la crisis de los misiles estalló, Estados Unidos y la OTAN sacrificaron una parte de la cohetería que estaba en Turquía y garantizaron que EE.UU. no invadiera Cuba. El objetivo era contentar a Fidel Castro y buscarle una explicación a la instalación y luego, al retiro de los misiles en Cuba.

Me parece que Putin, a estas alturas de la invasión, sabe que las Fuerzas Armadas rusas son un “tigre de papel”, pero con colmillos atómicos. No es conveniente humillarlo, pero tampoco permitirle que haga lo que desee con la OTAN. Si Finlandia y Suecia quieren pertenecer a la organización defensiva, están en su derecho. La OTAN es también un tratado para impedir la proliferación nuclear, lo que es perfecto para esgrimir una excusa rusa.

En todo caso, Suecia y Finlandia pueden fabricar armas nucleares contra Rusia si este país se empeña en que no entren en la OTAN. Nadie se mete con Corea del Norte, que comparte frontera con Rusia. Tienen la bomba atómica y posibilidades de llegar con un cohete a Tokio o a Seúl. Todo lo que deben hacer es modificar la cabeza para asegurarse de que llevan carga nuclear. Ellos, los norcoreanos, aseguran que pueden calcinar Los Ángeles o San Francisco. Tal vez podrían destruir Washington o Nueva York. Nadie, lógicamente, se arriesga a averiguarlo. No tiene sentido. Suecia y Finlandia pueden lograr lo mismo que Moscú. Por eso, si yo fuera asesor de Putin (Dios me libre de ese tormento), le diría que están mejor dentro que fuera de la OTAN.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/26/opinion-suecia-y-finlandia-deben-entrar-cuanto-antes-en-la-otan/

(CNN Español) -- Nos criamos con la mirada, el corazón y la puerta abierta a la calle de par en par, la acera fue, por décadas, una prolongación de la casa familiar, ese lugar infinito donde convivieron enfrentadas tres generaciones.



Desde muy temprano, los amiguitos rompían esa cuarta pared que significa el gancho de la puerta, y sin averiguar, pasaban hasta la cocina, donde la olla de presión sonaba anunciando frijoles colorados para el almuerzo.

Llegábamos de la escuela, tirábamos la maleta sobre el sofá y saltábamos a nuestro escenario natural, la calle. Jugamos a las bolas, al pon, al béisbol, montamos carriolas, lanzábamos los yaquis sobre el piso frío, recién baldeado por las tías o la hermana mayor. Nos criaron los abuelos, nuestros verdaderos héroes, mientras los padres desaparecían al amanecer. Los campamentos en la playa, las acampadas, los círculos de interés y hasta los cumpleaños podían ser colectivos. Estar hacinada en un internado era para mí una verdadera pesadilla, un castigo, un modo de alejarme de todo lo que verdaderamente me gustaba: leer en la biblioteca, ver teatro guiñol, visitar museos, conversar con mi madre; para otros, un modo de escapar de sus casas y de convivir 24 horas con esos nuevos hermanos, elegidos por voluntad. Las vivencias que atravesamos en aquellos campamentos, el hambre y los sacrificios, las pérdidas, las fiebres y los primeros amores, son ya parte indisoluble de la memoria afectiva que conforma nuestro patrimonio sentimental.

Al llegar a Estados Unidos, conocí otro modo de relacionamiento familiar, otro hábitat, ese otro escenario para crecer y hasta una nueva variante para el intercambio entre adolescentes. Se trata de chicos que salen del colegio y van directo a su habitación, pasan más de 15 horas encerrados allí, comen, se bañan y luego, se conectan con el mundo y con sus amigos a través de un teléfono o de un computador. Las aplicaciones, los portales de internet son para ellos lo que otrora fueron para nosotros las calles, las playas, los carnavales, las fiestas infantiles o los cines de barrio: un vehículo hacia la empatía, un transportador de sueños y en ciertos y determinados casos –no en todos–, los padres vienen siendo una especie de roommate que te maneja, te paga la casa, la escuela, los médicos y la alimentación, seres cercanos con quienes compartes tus ideas o no, dependiendo siempre del ánimo o la situación sentimental del infante.

Aunque nunca debemos generalizar, he indagado con algunos padres que tienen en casa hijos de entre siete y dieciocho años: ¿Comen juntos o comparten en familia? A veces. ¿Hablan con sus hermanos, abuelos, amigos en su idioma original? Muy pocas veces y por obligación. ¿Comparten sus preocupaciones, los problemas dentro del colegio, sus sensaciones o necesidades existenciales con sus hermanos o padres? Solo en ciertos casos y con mucho esfuerzo e insistencia en que lo hagan. No todos hacen deportes, ni comen sano, ni salen a despejar al aire libre, la obesidad infantil es cada vez más evidente entre los más jóvenes. Las mayores vivencias son simulacros de estímulos que reciben, a través de una pantalla, casi siempre sentados o acostados.

Tengo la sensación de que aquí muchos menores de edad tienen en sus manos el control del relacionamiento, y sus padres, aunque lo intentan, no siempre pueden entrar al interior de sus preocupaciones, necesidades o anhelos.

Existe una autoridad mayor, una jerarquía invertida, un muro difícil de derribar entre ellos y sus padres. Los pequeños pueden llamar al 911 en caso de sentirse maltratados y denunciar a sus familiares. La empatía, la proxemia, el lenguaje extraverbal entre padres e hijos, amigos y conocidos, pasa por un protocolo que, al menos a mí, que no tuve hijos, pero fui parte de una “pandilla” de chiquillos abiertos, expresivos y sin ningún misterio, me resulta complejo de asimilar.

Los niños no siempre desean salir de su cuarto a saludar cuando llega un familiar cercano o una visita ocasional, incluso, hay casas donde parece no viven niños o adolescentes. He sido testigo de que algunos padres temen importunar a sus hijos, tocarle a la puerta, darles una orden, pedirles un favor y empiezan a actuar con cierto temor, y comienzan a comportarse como si fueran los hijos de sus hijos.

Busco un nexo, un cordón que me conduzca a interactuar para conocerlos mejor, necesito encontrar temas de diálogo y no lucir desactualizada o tonta, intento comunicarme en su lengua y mientras lo hago, con mayor o menor suerte, me cuestiono tantas cosas. Si ellos mismos saben quiénes son, de dónde vienen, qué quieren. Hay cosas que, por respeto, no me atrevo a preguntar, pero y sus padres ¿saben si fuman a escondidas, si consumen drogas, si están enamorados, qué piensan de la noticia sobre el chico que intentó llevar un arma a su escuela, tienen miedo, se sienten solos, a qué universidad desean irse a estudiar, quieren seguir estudiando, hasta qué edad les gustaría vivir con sus padres, les molesta que los adultos siempre hablen del monotema: la política, la eterna problemática de los países que dejaron atrás, se sienten cómodos con su sexualidad, les parece demasiado simple definirse con uno u otro género, les gusta este país, qué piensan del lugar donde nacieron? Pero la pregunta más significativa es: ¿Conocen los padres profundamente a sus hijos o son pequeños extraños que simplemente conviven a su lado?",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/25/opinion-wendy-guerra-pequenos-extranos-hijos-orix/
214,OPINIÓN | Lo que se revela cuando los estadounidenses se quitan las mascarillas,"¿Tiene fecha de vencimiento el uso de mascarillas? 1:24

(CNN) -- Cuando el miércoles se reveló la celebridad que estaba dentro del disfraz de Jack in the Box en el programa de Fox ""The Masked Singer"", no era Joe Pesci, Robert Duvall, Elon Musk o Al Roker, como los jueces habían supuesto.

En su lugar, para consternación de muchos, incluidos algunos de los jueces, el hombre que cantó el éxito de 1982 ""Bad to the Bone"" era el exalcalde de Nueva York Rudy Giuliani, que recientemente fue noticia por sus esfuerzos extremos de apoyar la falsa narrativa de fraude electoral del expresidente Donald Trump. Como se preguntaba el Daily Beast: ""¿Qué hicimos para merecer esto?"".

El ridículo momento puntuó una semana de desenmascaramiento, no solo en el programa, sino en todo el país.

La protección era el objetivo en enero de 2021, cuando los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) anunciaron que las mascarillas serían obligatorias para los pasajeros de los aviones y el transporte público. Pero este lunes, poco después de que una jueza federal anulara el mandato de las mascarillas para el transporte, las aerolíneas dejaron de exigirlas y muchos pasajeros dejaron de usarlas.

Esas tiras de tela ayudaron a proteger a millones de pasajeros del covid-19, pero no pudieron enmascarar las divisiones en Estados Unidos, que parecen más amplias que nunca en el tercer año de la pandemia. En lugar de ello, las mascarillas se han convertido en símbolos culturales y en declaraciones personales que se imponen en un país en el que los confinamientos han aflojado los lazos personales entre nosotros.

publicidad

El hecho de que la decisión en contra del mandato de las mascarillas procediera de una jueza federal de Florida nombrada por Trump —y calificada como ""no cualificada"" por el Colegio de Abogados de Estados Unidos— no pasó desapercibido para los críticos del fallo.

La decisión de la jueza de distrito Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, escribió Jill Filipovic, ""parece usurpar la orientación de la salud pública mientras no entiende la ciencia o el idioma inglés"". El gobierno federal, sostuvo, solo está autorizado a ocuparse de cuestiones relacionadas con el ""saneamiento"", que según ella se limita a ""medidas que limpian algo"". Como el uso de una mascarilla no limpia nada, escribió, los mandatos sobre mascarillas están fuera del alcance de la autoridad del gobierno"".

""Todo esto es increíblemente peligroso: a una jueza de derecha no le gusta una normativa gubernamental y la anula por motivos increíblemente engañosos"", escribió Filipovic.

El Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, experto en enfermedades infecciosas, argumentó que sería prudente mantener el mandato de las mascarillas dada la continua propagación del coronavirus, pero también señaló la tensión que provoca en el aire. En un avión, escribió, ""nada es privado; todo es compartido, incluso el aire filtrado. Por deferencia a los que nos rodean, reprimimos nuestros lloriqueos al personal de la aerolínea, minimizamos nuestros paseos junto a los vecinos por el pasillo, nos resistimos a hacer saltos de tijera o -sobre todo- nos esforzamos por evitar la tos, porque todo ello puede afectar a los demás en nuestra pequeña e ineludible comunidad aérea"".

""Esta vida en común, por breve que sea, es desagradable para todos. Añadirle un mandato de mascarilla... parece haber inclinado a un segmento de los fanáticos de la resistencia a las mascarillas y las vacunas a una feroz, e incluso violenta, desobediencia no civilizada. La tendencia es lo suficientemente mala como para haber llamado la atención de la Administración Federal de Aviación (FAA, por sus siglas en inglés) y, en el caso de algunos pasajeros especialmente revoltosos, de la Oficina Federal de Investigación... La FAA recibió 1.150 informes de pasajeros revoltosos, de los cuales 744 estaban relacionados con el uso de mascarillas"".

Algunos expertos cuestionan la eficacia real de los mandatos de las mascarillas. En The New York Times, David Leonhardt escribió: ""Desgraciadamente, Estados Unidos ha pasado gran parte de los dos últimos años con el peor de los mundos en cuanto a mascarillas. Se ha exigido a la gente que las lleve durante horas y horas, provocando frustración y agotamiento y exacerbando la polarización política. Sin embargo, las normas han incluido suficientes excepciones para dejar que el covid se extienda de todos modos. La carga de los mandatos ha sido relativamente alta, mientras que los beneficios han sido relativamente bajos. Es lo contrario de lo que suele hacer una campaña de salud pública con éxito"".",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/25/opinion-lo-que-se-revela-estadounidenses-quitan-mascarillas-trax/
215,OPINIÓN | ¿Por qué la victoria de Macron es un gran golpe para Putin?,"Así fue el triunfo de Emmanuel Macron en Francia 3:49

Andelman, colaborador de CNN, dos veces ganador del premio Deadline Club, es un caballero de la Legión de Honor francesa, autor de "" A Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen "" y blogs en Andelman Unleashed.

París (CNN) — Francia, Europa y el mundo libre han sobrevivido a un desafío sustancial para su bienestar colectivo. A unos 2.000 kilómetros de distancia, el presidente ruso Vladimir Putin, sufrió un duro golpe cuando Emmanuel Macron derrotó a la retadora de ultraderecha Marine Le Pen, aliada de Putin, para convertirse en el primer presidente francés en una generación en ser reelegido.

El resultado de la contienda entre los dos, el líder más joven de Francia desde Napoleón y la tres veces aspirante a convertirse en la primera mujer presidenta de la nación, nunca estuvo definido para ninguno de los candidatos. Después de una primera votación muy reñida entre 12 candidatos hace dos semanas, los dos más votados se enfrentaron en el balotaje este domingo.

Apenas cerró la mayoría de las urnas en todo el país, los encuestadores proyectaron que Macron obtendría el 58,2% de los votos frente al 41,8% de Le Pen.

Los votantes simplemente optaron, en estos tiempos difíciles, por un término medio seguro en lugar de un candidato de ultraderecha que prometió destrozar la economía y la sociedad y acercar a Francia cada vez más a Rusia, todo en aras de un cambio que los franceses nunca han abrazado del todo. Lo que Le Pen hizo para la mayoría de sus decididos seguidores fue demostrar que podía ser ""presidencial"", aunque no presidenta de una Francia en la que la mayoría de los franceses probablemente no aspiran a vivir.

El margen que obtuvo Macron, a pesar de la alta abstención, la mayor en más de dos décadas, podría darle un impulso sustancial a obtener una mayoría definitiva en la Asamblea Nacional cuando se celebren los comicios para cubrir sus 577 escaños en junio.

Sobre todo, las elecciones del domingo en efecto resolvieron, al menos por el momento, la pregunta más importante planteada durante la campaña: ¿La mayoría de los franceses realmente quiere cambiar tanto su país y especialmente este tipo de gobierno que les ha servido tan bien para toda la Quinta República que ha durado casi tres cuartos de siglo? Especialmente cuando Macron está en posición de asumir de facto el liderazgo de Europa, llenando el vacío dejado por la partida el año pasado de la canciller alemana Angela Merkel.

A lo largo de la campaña, Macron definió cómo será su segundo y último mandato de cinco años con una pasión que igualó los ataques de su retadora, Le Pen, quien pintaba a Francia con una paleta monocromática. Su programa incluía reformar la Constitución francesa para restringir la inmigración que considera una amenaza para la identidad de Francia.

Macron dijo querer una Francia arcoíris, una nación receptiva a nuevas ideas propias o del extranjero, una que se sienta cómoda como líder de la Unión Europea, la OTAN y el mundo libre, que esté preparada para enfrentarse resueltamente a cualquier precio a las tiranías, en el exterior o en casa.

La Francia bajo Le Pen habría explorado un camino para el acomodo con esa Rusia que es una paria para gran parte del mundo libre, y habría mirado hacia adentro, dando la espalda Europa. Al mismo tiempo, ella habría impulsado prohibir el uso de pañuelos en la cabeza a las mujeres o de kipás para los hombres, y habría hecho referéndums para quitarle poder a una legislatura y un poder judicial que nunca logró dominar.

A la vez, ella delineó una perspectiva tentadora de impuestos más bajos y amplio gasto social, lo más atractivo para una nación donde la inflación se disparó a niveles no vistos desde 1985. Pero como advirtió Macron en varias ocasiones, primero habría que hallar cómo pagar todo esto.

Una vez que acaben las celebraciones de victoria, el reelecto presidente tendrá un plato lleno, y gran parte del mundo está atento de la agenda que fije. Macron aún tiene dos meses más como líder titular de Europa, en el sistema rotativo que permite a cada país de la UE un mandato de seis meses. Con suerte, usará ese período sabiamente, y seguirá uniendo al continente para enfrentar a Putin.

Al mismo tiempo, habrá desafíos y oportunidades: Finlandia y quizás Suecia en su intento de ingresar a la OTAN, y Ucrania buscando una vía rápida para su propia entrada en la UE.

Y en casa, Macron seguirá luchando contra la creciente inflación, como en toda Europa, que ya urge a los líderes del continente para que encuentren alguna vía para sortear el impacto de cualquier nueva sanción energética que pueda imponerse a Rusia.

Luego, está el problema de los refugiados en alza, 5 millones de personas que huyeron de Ucrania en dos meses. El flujo seguirá, primero hacia los miembros de primera línea de la UE como Polonia, que ya recibió 3 millones, así como a Rumania y la República Checa, deseosos todos de ver que otras naciones como Francia y Alemania asuman parte de esa carga. Hasta ahora, apenas han llegado 30.000 a Francia, que acordó aceptar hasta 100.000, la gota que anuncia el tsunami por el que Macron se verá obligado a responder.

Más allá de Europa, Macron desempeñará un papel central manejando la pregonada influencia de Francia en el escenario mundial. En África, últimamente se han multiplicado los golpes de estado desde Malí hasta Chad y Burkina Faso, junto a actividades terroristas en expansión en las antiguas colonias francesas. Macron finalmente se vio obligado a retirar las fuerzas militares este año luego de decenas de muertes en África Occidental. Francia continuará buscando un camino a seguir, trabajando con líderes africanos de ideas afines para evitar que los mercenarios rusos llenen el vacío.

Y en Medio Oriente, Macron ya busca un reinicio con una serie de países donde Francia tiene intereses comerciales crecientes, en particular las naciones del Golfo que se han convertido en importantes compradores de equipos militares franceses y en la antigua colonia francesa de Líbano, que sufre una gran crisis política y económica. Macron ha buscado posicionar ante Medio Oriente y el resto del mundo a Francia como un socio leal y confiable, en lugares donde se está produciendo un realineamiento que los aleja de sus aliados tradicionales, particularmente de Estados Unidos.

En Asia, Macron seguramente buscará jugar un papel de liderazgo para estabilizar la relación cada vez más tensa entre la UE y China. El afán de ambas partes por expandir el comercio se ve afectado por las violaciones a los derechos humanos y el continuo apoyo de China a Rusia durante su guerra con Ucrania.

Al mismo tiempo, Macron quedó herido y enfurecido por un pacto de seguridad del gobierno de Biden con el Reino Unido y Australia (conocido como AUKUS), que a su vez torpedeó un importante contrato de submarinos entre Francia y Australia. Estados Unidos vio el pacto trilateral como su nuevo baluarte contra China. Eso se ha puesto de relieve ahora que China firmó un pacto de seguridad mutua con las Islas Salomón, alimentando los temores de que Beijing pueda estar buscando una base naval importante en la región, todo se reunió como un pequeño placer por el infortunio ajeno, en algunos rincones del Elíseo.

Con la victoria presidencial fresca, Macron todavía enfrenta su mayor desafío si quiere poder avanzar con su amplio menú de iniciativas: otra elección nacional en junio, cuando los votantes elijan una nueva Asamblea Nacional. Muchos de quienes se enfrentaron a Macron en la contienda presidencial buscarán destronar la cómoda mayoría legislativa de la que ha disfrutado. En muchos aspectos, esta votación podría tener una mayor importancia a largo plazo para Macron, Francia y su lugar en el mundo que la carrera presidencial.

Por el momento, sin embargo, Occidente todavía tiene un aliado incondicional y leal con aspiraciones y principios democráticos para desempeñar un papel fundamental en el futuro de Europa, uno que la Casa Blanca sin duda encontrará atractivo, tan preocupada como estaba la administración Biden de que Le Pen pudiera encontrar el camino al palacio presidencial del Elíseo.

Estados Unidos haría bien, entonces, en celebrar esta victoria.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/25/opinion-victoria-macron-golpe-putin-trax/
216,OPINIÓN | Una paz negociada es la única forma de poner fin a la guerra de Rusia contra Ucrania,"Mariúpol, en riesgo de caer ante las tropas rusas 1:51

Nota del editor: Jeffrey D. Sachs es profesor y director del Centro para el Desarrollo Sostenible de la Universidad de Columbia. Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario pertenecen exclusivamente al autor. Puedes leer más artículos de opinión en CNNe.como/opinion.

(CNN) -- Solo hay una respuesta a la guerra en Ucrania: un acuerdo de paz.

Es probable que la doble estrategia de EE.UU. para ayudar a Ucrania a superar la invasión rusa mediante la imposición de duras sanciones y el suministro de armamento sofisticado a las fuerzas armadas ucranianas se quede corta. Lo que se necesita es un acuerdo de paz, que puede estar al alcance. Sin embargo, para llegar a un acuerdo, Estados Unidos tendrá que comprometerse con la OTAN, algo que Washington ha rechazado hasta ahora.

Putin inició la guerra en Ucrania y ha dicho que las negociaciones han llegado a un punto muerto, sin cerrarles la puerta. Pero antes de que comenzara la guerra, Putin presentó a Occidente una lista de demandas que incluía, sobre todo, detener la ampliación de la OTAN.

Estados Unidos, deliberadamente, no estaba dispuesto a comprometerse en ese punto. Ahora sería un buen momento para revisar esa política. Putin también tendría que mostrar su voluntad de hacer concesiones para que las negociaciones tengan éxito.

La estrategia centrada en armas y sanciones de Estados Unidos puede sonar convincente en la cámara de resonancia de la opinión pública estadounidense, pero en realidad no funciona en el escenario global. Goza de poco apoyo fuera de Estados Unidos y Europa, y eventualmente también puede enfrentar una reacción política negativa dentro de Estados Unidos y Europa.

Para cualquiera que esté familiarizado con el esfuerzo bélico ruso y el horror que ha desatado sobre los civiles, puede parecer obvio que Rusia sería relegada a la condición de paria a nivel mundial. Pero ese no es el caso: los países en desarrollo, especialmente, se han negado a unirse a la campaña de aislamiento de Occidente, como se vio más recientemente en una votación liderada por Estados Unidos para sacar a Rusia del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Es cierto que 93 países apoyaron la medida, pero otros 100 países no lo hicieron (24 se opusieron, 58 se abstuvieron y 18 no votaron).

Aún más sorprendente, esos 100 países albergan al 76% de la población mundial.

Los países bien pueden haber tenido razones no ideológicas para oponerse a la iniciativa estadounidense, incluidos los vínculos comerciales con Rusia. Pero el hecho es que gran parte del mundo ha rechazado aislar a Moscú, especialmente en la medida en que a Washington le gustaría.

Las sanciones son una gran parte de la estrategia de Estados Unidos. No es probable que derroten a Rusia, pero es probable que impongan altos costos en todo el mundo. En el mejor de los casos, pueden empujar a Rusia hacia un acuerdo de paz y, por lo tanto, deben desplegarse junto con un impulso intensivo para una paz negociada.

Hay innumerables problemas con las sanciones económicas.

La primera es que incluso si las sanciones causan problemas económicos en Rusia, es poco probable que cambien la política o las políticas rusas de manera decisiva.

Piensa en las duras sanciones que Estados Unidos ha impuesto a Venezuela, Irán y Corea del Norte. Sí, han debilitado estas economías, pero no han cambiado la política o las políticas de estos países de la manera que busca el gobierno de EE.UU.

El segundo problema es que las sanciones son fáciles de evadir, al menos en parte, y es probable que surjan más evasiones con el tiempo. Las sanciones de EE.UU. se aplican con mayor eficacia a las transacciones en dólares que involucran al sistema bancario de EE.UU. Los países que buscan evadir las sanciones encuentran formas de realizar transacciones a través de medios no bancarios o no monetarios. Podemos esperar un número creciente de transacciones con Rusia en rublos, rupias, renminbi y otras monedas distintas del dólar.

En la guerra de Putin en Ucrania ¿quién miente y quién no? 1:30

El tercer problema relacionado es que la mayor parte del mundo no cree en las sanciones y tampoco toma partido en la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania. Suma a todos los países y regiones que imponen sanciones a Rusia (EE.UU., Reino Unido, la Unión Europea, Japón, Singapur, Australia, Nueva Zelandia y un puñado de otros) y su población combinada llega a solo el 14% de la población mundial.

El cuarto problema es el efecto boomerang. Las sanciones a Rusia dañan no solo a Rusia sino a toda la economía mundial, avivando las interrupciones en la cadena de suministro, la inflación y la escasez de alimentos. Esta es la razón por la que es probable que muchos países europeos continúen importando gas y petróleo de Rusia, y por la que Hungría y quizás otros países europeos acepten pagar a Rusia en rublos. Es probable que el efecto boomerang también perjudique a los demócratas en las elecciones intermedias de noviembre, ya que la inflación acaba con los ingresos reales de los votantes.

El quinto problema es la demanda inelástica (insensible a los precios) de las exportaciones rusas de energía y cereales. A medida que se reduce la cantidad de exportaciones rusas, aumentan los precios mundiales de esos productos. Rusia puede terminar con volúmenes de exportación más bajos pero con ganancias de exportación casi iguales o incluso mayores.

El sexto problema es geopolítico. Otros países, y sobre todo China, ven la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania, al menos en parte, como una guerra en la que Rusia se resiste a la ampliación de la OTAN a Ucrania. Es por eso que China argumenta repetidamente que los intereses de seguridad legítimos de Rusia están en juego en la guerra.

A Estados Unidos le gusta decir que la OTAN es una alianza puramente defensiva, pero Rusia, China y otros piensan lo contrario. Miran con recelo el bombardeo de Serbia por parte de la OTAN en 1999, las fuerzas de la OTAN en Afganistán durante 20 años después del 11 de septiembre y el bombardeo de Libia por parte de la OTAN en 2011, que derrocó a Muamar Gadafi. Los líderes rusos se han opuesto a la ampliación de la OTAN hacia el este desde que comenzó a mediados de la década de 1990 con la República Checa, Hungría y Polonia. Es notable que cuando Putin pidió a la OTAN que detuviera su ampliación a Ucrania, Biden se negó deliberadamente a negociar con Rusia sobre el tema.

En resumen, muchos países, incluida ciertamente China, no respaldarán las presiones globales sobre Rusia que podrían conducir a la expansión de la OTAN. El resto del mundo quiere la paz, no una victoria de Estados Unidos o la OTAN en una guerra de poder con Rusia.

A Estados Unidos le encantaría ver a Putin derrotado militarmente, y los armamentos de la OTAN han asestado un duro golpe a las fuerzas rusas. Pero también es cierto que Ucrania está siendo destruida en el proceso. Es poco probable que Rusia declare la derrota y se retire. Es mucho más probable que Rusia escale, incluso, potencialmente, mediante el uso de armas nucleares. Por lo tanto, las armas de la OTAN pueden infligir enormes costos a Rusia, pero no pueden salvar a Ucrania.

Todo esto es para decir que la estrategia estadounidense en Ucrania puede desangrar a Rusia pero no puede salvar a Ucrania. Solo un acuerdo de paz puede hacer eso. De hecho, el enfoque actual socavará la estabilidad económica y política en todo el mundo y podría dividir al mundo en bandos a favor y en contra de la OTAN, en detrimento a largo plazo de Estados Unidos.

Por lo tanto, la diplomacia estadounidense está castigando a Rusia, pero sin muchas posibilidades de éxito real para Ucrania o para los intereses estadounidenses. El verdadero éxito es que las tropas rusas regresen a casa y se logre la seguridad de Ucrania. Esos resultados pueden lograrse en la mesa de negociación.

El paso clave es que EE.UU., los aliados de la OTAN y Ucrania dejen en claro que la OTAN no se ampliará a Ucrania mientras Rusia detenga la guerra y abandone Ucrania. Los países alineados con Putin, y los que no eligieron ningún bando, le dirían entonces a Putin que, dado que ha detenido la ampliación de la OTAN, ahora es el momento de que Rusia abandone el campo de batalla y regrese a casa. Por supuesto, las negociaciones podrían fracasar si las demandas de Rusia siguen siendo inaceptables. Pero al menos deberíamos intentar, y de hecho esforzarnos mucho, ver si la paz se puede lograr a través de la neutralidad de Ucrania respaldada por garantías internacionales.

Todo el discurso duro de Biden, sobre la salida de Putin del poder, el genocidio y los crímenes de guerra, no salvará a Ucrania. La mejor oportunidad para salvar a Ucrania es a través de negociaciones que pongan al mundo de su lado. Al priorizar la paz en lugar de la ampliación de la OTAN, EE.UU. reuniría el apoyo de una mayor parte del mundo y, por lo tanto, ayudaría a llevar la paz a Ucrania y la seguridad y la estabilidad para todo el mundo.",https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/04/21/opinion-una-paz-negociada-es-la-unica-forma-de-poner-fin-a-la-guerra-de-rusia-contra-ucrania-trax/

221,Atmospheric river of moisture will trigger storms and tornadoes this week,"A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.

(CNN) You may have heard of atmospheric rivers impacting the West Coast. We had several notable ones this year that brought flooding , staggering snowfall amounts to the mountains in the west, and even landslides .

An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky.

We talk a lot about them in the West because large-scale storm systems bring the region up to 40% of their yearly rainfall.

But we started wondering: Is there anywhere else where these happen?

Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week.

The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren't talked about much isn't because they are rare. In fact, they are quite common.

""Atmospheric rivers are more frequent on the East Coast than they are on the West Coast,"" said Jason Cordeira, Associate Professor of Meteorology at Plymouth State University. ""They're just not as impactful and don't usually produce as much rainfall.""

While Cordeira noted it is tough to give an exact number of how many atmospheric rivers impact the East every year, he says a rough estimate would be anywhere from 80-100 per year!

WOW.

The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage.

""The West Coast is a much more arid climate. And they usually get precipitation during just half of the year,"" Cordeira pointed out.

The East Coast accumulates its annual rainfall from several sources: afternoon storms, cold fronts and hurricanes, which can bring MUCH higher rain amounts than an atmospheric river.

""Some of the strongest atmospheric river events that are perfectly oriented, can produce 6-8 inches of rain,"" Cordeira reported. ""Those totals are dwarfed by the amount of rainfall that we can get from a hurricane.""

Some recent hurricanes such as Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017 , have resulted in rainfall totals measured in FEET, not inches.

This week's atmospheric river won't leave the footprint Harvey did by any stretch, but it could affect the same areas as Harvey.

The Deep South will once again be hit by a series of storms this week, along with the Plains, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.

So, needless to say, this week's weather will be much more far-reaching.

It has no doubt been a super active stretch of severe weather in the South and Southeast, as this is the fourth week in a row where active weather is affecting the same areas.

However, as we get deeper into April and May, we should start to see the storm tracks shift a little farther north into what is traditionally, ""Tornado Alley,"" which is what we will begin to see this week.

The storm's timeline

A series of storm systems will impact the US this week from coast to coast. It will bring everything from blizzard conditions to tornadoes to flash flooding, an exhausting week to say the least.

The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 ""enhanced risk"" of severe weather today for central Arkansas, however, anywhere from San Antonio to the Ohio Valley could see storms today.

The extreme northeast of Texas, southeast Oklahoma and western and central Arkansas, including Little Rock, are under a tornado watch until 11 p.m. CT Monday.

Large hail -- possibly greater than baseball size -- and wind gusts to 70 mph are also a concern for the area.

While this is happening in the central part of the country, a robust system will be entering the Pacific Northwest, and will crisscross the country in dramatic fashion today, bringing heavy rain to the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon and California, and several feet of snow for the Cascades.

""This system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and Northern Plains,"" noted the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). ""Over a foot of snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central North Dakota on Tuesday.""

Blizzard warnings are in effect for portions of the Dakotas and Montana from Tuesday through Thursday.

""Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches [are forecast],"" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Bismarck. ""Winds gusting as high as 50 mph [are also possible].""

The heavy snow and high winds will make travel nearly impossible for those areas due to whiteout conditions and will also create avalanche dangers. Many of the western mountain ranges have some sort of avalanche danger today, so be sure to check here before heading out, especially in the backcountry.

We wrote a story earlier in the season about what causes extreme avalanche dangers and why you only have about 15-30 minutes to be found alive after burial. Click here to read more.

After the system blankets the West with its late-season dump of snow, the storm will amplify as it heads east. It will combine with the available moisture provided by the atmospheric river we talked about and will result in the perfect setup for severe weather.

The tornado threat will be even stronger for Tuesday and Wednesday in the midsection of the country. But the storms will be impacting areas much farther north than the previous rounds of severe weather we have seen during the last three weeks.

Tuesday there is again a Level 3 out of 5 ""enhanced"" risk of severe storms from Dallas to Omaha, which includes more than 16 million people. While it is the area with the highest likelihood of storms, nearly 40 million people will have some possibility of seeing storms.

""Any thunderstorms that can develop in this very favorable thermodynamic environment will likely become severe quickly,"" the SPC advised. They mentioned any supercell (strong thunderstorm) will be capable of producing tornadoes, saying ""some of the tornadoes could be strong.""

By Wednesday, we enter Day Three of this multiday severe event. The main threat area will shift east with the third day of a Level 3 out of 5 ""enhanced risk"" of severe weather. The bullseye will be from northern Louisiana to the south side of Chicago and include places like Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis, St. Louis, and Indianapolis.

""Large to very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes will all be possible,"" said the SPC. ""Strong tornadoes may occur."" Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Chicago could all see storms as well.

The good news is the severe threat will be over in time for Easter weekend. We could still see some lingering showers in the eastern half of the country, and some mountain snow in the Rockies, which could affect egg hunts and sunrise services. While things could change between now and then, right now the SPC doesn't have any areas highlighted for severe weather during Easter weekend as of now.

As if severe storms and blizzard conditions weren't enough of a headline this week, extremely cold air will follow the front, plunging overnight temperatures into the single digits is forecast for portions of the northern Plains.

""Low temperatures in the single digits are possible and this could cause issues,"" said the NWS office in Billings. ""Do not be deceived by the sun, it is going to be fighting a very cold airmass.""

And as the climate crisis continues to change the dynamics of our weather, expect atmospheric rivers to become more intense as well.

""It's expected that as the air temperatures increase, the air can hold more water vapor and therefore any storms that are comprised of water vapor will have more of it,"" Cordeira explained. ""So, an atmospheric river, which is defined as a region of water vapor, will likely become more intense. Their frequency may not be more common, but their intensity could become larger.""

Weather in focus

A view Lake Powell on March 27, 2022 in Page, Arizona. Water levels continue to drop as severe drought worsens across the western United States.

The drought-stricken West is getting even drier, according to the latest drought monitor

""Central Washington, Idaho, and northwest Montana also saw increases in drought extent or severity as short-term dryness continues to build upon long-term moisture deficits extending back to last year,"" according to the drought monitor. ""Many parts of southern Idaho, and the rest of the West, have set records for the driest three-month period (January to March) going back 100 years or more.""

Texas is also facing extreme drought with 95% of the state in some level of drought. At 26,000 square miles, Texas has more ""exceptional drought"" area than any other state, per the latest US Drought Monitor. The 26,000 square miles of exceptional drought is larger than the state of West Virginia (or more than three times the size of Massachusetts).

The drought is only making fire conditions worse. From Texas to Kansas, there will be an extreme fire danger especially on Tuesday, as dry conditions and winds topping 50 mph will cover the area.

222,Scientists in the US are flying planes into clouds to make it snow more,"A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.

(CNN) With 61% of the contiguous US in drought, wouldn't it be nice if we could just ""make it rain"" or just ""make more snow?""

Well, certain parts of the country are doing just that, sort of. It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new.

It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons (most notably China) , but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West.

It's also surrounded with controversy.

We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for Wyoming's Weather Modification Program , who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing.

Gondzar said some people say ""you're playing God,"" others say ""you are stealing moisture from the storm,"" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold.

""Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,"" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, ""in a nutshell.""

Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 as part of a study . Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works.

This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming.

King Air's twin engine plane that is used for cloud seeding.

She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down.

When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game.

Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze).

Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky.

The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise.

It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent.

""The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,"" Gondzar explained. ""But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range."" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target.

The most popular way is by plane, using flares. ""There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,"" Gondzar pointed out.

This photo shows flares fixed on the aircraft's wing that house the silver iodide used for cloud seeding.

Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and ""seed"" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation.

The silver iodide ""is a natural salt compound,"" Gondzar emphasized. ""The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.""

But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again.

Is it working?

""Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,"" Gondzar said. ""You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.""

Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting.

""There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,"" Gondzar noted. ""The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.""

She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days.

According to Wyoming's Water Systems Data Map , some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down.

Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term.

""It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,"" Gondzar urged.

She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap.

""Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.""

But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain.

""This is not something that we can do out of thin air,"" Gondzar cautioned. ""The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.""

It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range.

""The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,"" Gondzar said. ""But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.""

She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed.

""A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,"" Gondzar remarked. ""We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.""

She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific.

""There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.""

Playing God

While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree.

Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer Rachel Ramirez

He told her ""It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.""

He went on to ask, ""To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?""

He believes water equity issues need to be researched more.

Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim.

She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver.

""There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,"" Gondzar noted. ""So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.""

She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road.

There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle.

Climate scientists remain skeptical this is the silver bullet

Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather.

Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are.

""How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?"" Swain told CNN. ""This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.""

Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways.

That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. Their results , published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger.

During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall.

In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified ""unambiguous seeding patterns,"" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds.

Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding — up to 10% — isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West.

""It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,"" she said. ""That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.""

When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology.

""I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,"" she contended. ""So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.""

""But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,"" Tessendorf added.

With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts.

""There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,"" Swain asserted. ""The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/weather/cloud-seeding-weather-modification-wxn/index.html
223,This is how a thunderstorm produces a tornado,"(CNN) Tornadoes are one of Earth's most violent forces of nature. They have occurred in all 50 states and have been spotted throughout the year. While they are most common in the United States, tornadoes can occur all over the globe.

While great strides have been made in the study of tornadoes, there's still so much we don't know about them. They have been studied immensely during the last few decades to learn what causes them and how they form.

CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, who is also a storm chaser, has been following and studying these storms since 2005.

""Something you learn from studying tornadoes, especially in the field, is that there is no perfect formula for forming a tornado -- every storm is unique,"" says Miller.

An aerial view from a drone shows tornado damage to homes on March 26, 2021, in Newnan, Georgia. According to reports, an EF-4 rating tornado passed through the region.

""Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more 'ingredients' to storm formation is missing or lacking,"" says Miller.

While there's no perfect formula as to which storms will produce tornadoes, there's commonality in the anatomy of the systems that result in tornadoes.

There are even signs you can see that will help you understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado.

The development of a thunderstorm

As a thunderstorm develops, air rises, helping the cloud grow taller and taller.

As warm air rises, clouds begin to grow taller and taller. This is the developing phase of the thunderstorm. You can see fluffy white cumulus clouds grow taller with your own eyes. This is before you see rain or hear thunder.

As the clouds grow, you will notice the bottom of the cloud darkening. You will many times see the very top of the cloud flattening out, creating an anvil shape that protrudes from the top of the cloud.

This indicates very cold air at the top of the cloud and could be a precursor to the possibility of hail.

When a thunderstorm becomes a supercell

As the storm matures, it could become what's known as a supercell. A supercell is a rotating thunderstorm.

""Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,"" says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Cold air rushing out of the storm cloud, producing a gust front.

During this mature phase of the thunderstorm or supercell; heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected.

Sometimes, you will feel a strong gust of wind a few moments before the rain arrives. This is called a gust front. This is caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly, ahead of the storm. This is a sure sign that a storm is near.

The formation of a tornado

Tornadoes are usually formed from supercells. These supercells develop when there are several ingredients in place to help them thrive: instability, lift and wind shear.

Within the supercell, wind shear becomes a crucial component to the storms development. Shear is when winds change directions with height. This creates spin within the thunderstorm cloud.

Another force that's acting inside the supercel l is a downdraft. This is an area of drier air that is pushed down from the storm. As it's forced down, it wraps around the backside of the storm.

The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado. This vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground -- at that point it becomes a tornado.

""The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the 'wall cloud,'"" says Miller.

The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air.

When this rotating column of air touches the ground, a tornado has formed.

The presence of a wall cloud doesn't always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds. ""You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,"" says Miller.

Tornadoes have produced the strongest winds recorded on Earth

Most tornadoes are relatively small and short-lived, and can still be dangerous and cause damage. However, more violent tornadoes can be more than a mile wide and stay on the ground for more than an hour. This is because they have much more momentum than the smaller tornadoes, making them harder to stop.

A tornado cuts its way through a field in Minneola, Kansas, on May 24, 2016.

Miller has witnessed roughly 15-20 tornadoes during his years storm chasing.

""There is no denying that there is a certain amount of excitement that comes from seeing a tornado when you are set out with the intent of seeing one,"" says Miller.

""At the same time, you are balancing that excitement with a sizable amount of anxiety and concern over what the tornado could do, especially if there are residents in the immediate path of the storm. As someone who spent years studying, and many more years reporting on, tornadoes, it still gets all my nerves firing when you see a tornado in person.""

224,4 tornado safety tips that could save your life,"(CNN) They can happen at any time and threaten every corner of the United States. It is time to prepare for one of the world's most destructive types of weather: tornadoes.

On average, the United States sees more than 1,200 tornadoes per year , far more than any country in the world.

While tornadoes can be deadly, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones before, during and after disaster strikes.

1. Get alerts

First things first: Understand the difference between a tornado watch and tornado warning , and be able to identify your city and county on a map.

Outdoor sirens -- While sirens can be useful, they are not always the best way to receive tornado warnings, since they are not widespread.

-- While sirens can be useful, they are not always the best way to receive tornado warnings, since they are not widespread. Local television -- Local stations will provide on-air coverage for your area during severe weather, but the TV won't wake you up if a tornado warning occurs at night.

NOAA Weather Radio -- While it may sound old-fashioned, a weather radio will provide you with up-to-date information straight from your nearest National Weather Service forecasting office.

-- While it may sound old-fashioned, a weather radio will provide you with up-to-date information straight from your nearest National Weather Service forecasting office. Mobile phone -- Wireless emergency alerts are one of the best ways to receive tornado warnings anytime, anyplace. In an IOS device go to settings, then notifications, and scroll to the bottom. Make sure emergency alerts -- listed under government alerts -- are clicked on. If you use a third-party app, be sure the alerts are issued in a timely fashion. Most importantly, have those notifications ON.

2. Know the safest places to shelter

There are a few places that will keep you the most sheltered in a tornado.

Underground -- A basement or cellar is the safest place to protect yourself from a tornado's violent winds.

-- A basement or cellar is the safest place to protect yourself from a tornado's violent winds. The first floor in an interior room -- In a home, this place could be a bathroom or closet with no windows. Put as many walls between you and the outdoors as possible.

Things can get a little more complicated if you don't have access to a permanent structure.

Mobile homes -- Trailers are light and will easily topple in strong winds, so they are one of the worst places to be during a tornado. If you receive a tornado warning while you are in a mobile home, you should go to the closest sturdy building. If a reliable shelter is not available, the next best option is to lie in a ditch and protect your head from flying debris.

Trailers are light and will easily topple in strong winds, so they are one of the worst places to be during a tornado. If you receive a tornado warning while you are in a mobile home, you should go to the closest sturdy building. If a reliable shelter is not available, the next best option is to lie in a ditch and protect your head from flying debris. Cars -- The National Weather Service emphasizes that a vehicle is not a safe place to be if a tornado threatens you. Although this is true, one study found that people belted in a car are generally safer than those who stay in a mobile home. So, if you are in a vehicle during a tornado warning, exiting your vehicle and seeking shelter in the closest permanent structure is the best option. If that is not possible, experts suggest you either buckle your seatbelt and crouch down in your car or abandon your vehicle and lie in a nearby ditch.

Be sure your plan is updated and works at all times. If you plan to seek shelter in a public building, make sure it is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your plans need to work at any time of the day or night.

3. Avoid dangerous places

Under highway overpasses -- Sheltering under a bridge may seem like a good option if you are stuck in your car, but the narrow passage can act like a funnel and amplify winds.

-- Sheltering under a bridge may seem like a good option if you are stuck in your car, but the narrow passage can act like a funnel and amplify winds. Outdoors -- There are no safe options if you are stuck outside during a tornado warning with no permanent shelter nearby. As an absolute last resort, stay away from trees or other free-standing objects, crouch down in the lowest-lying area you can find, and cover your head.

As an absolute last resort, stay away from trees or other free-standing objects, crouch down in the lowest-lying area you can find, and cover your head. Upper-level floors -- If you live on an upper floor of an apartment building or work in a tall office building, find a way to seek shelter on the first floor safely. An interior hallway can be a safe bet.

-- If you live on an upper floor of an apartment building or work in a tall office building, find a way to seek shelter on the first floor safely. An interior hallway can be a safe bet. Warehouses, department stores, grocery stores -- Structures with large open spaces are particularly vulnerable to collapse, even in relatively weak tornadoes. If possible, find a small, enclosed area to shelter in, and avoid the building's outer walls.

229,"19 named storms expected this hurricane season, above average but becoming more common, CSU forecast says","(CNN) After two consecutive years of exhausting the hurricane name list , forecasters are predicting 19 named storms this hurricane season, five more than normal.

Of the 19 storms, nine are expected to become hurricanes, and four are expected to become major hurricanes -- Category 3 or higher -- with winds exceeding 111 miles per hour, according to hurricane experts at Colorado State University (CSU).

CSU's Tropical Meteorology Project team released its annual Atlantic basin hurricane seasonal forecast Thursday, marking the 39th year they have issued a preseason report.

The report details another very active hurricane season -- which runs from June 1 to November 30 -- and includes an above-average forecast for all categories of storms.

Déjà vu

This year's forecast looks eerily similar to predictions for the past two years.

Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the CSU Department of Atmospheric Science and lead author of the report, compared the 2022 forecast to those of 2021 and 2020.

""For example, in both April 2020 and April 2021, we forecast eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. This year, we're forecasting nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes,"" Klotzbach told CNN.

The new hurricane season is shaping up to be just as, if not slightly more, active than last year's, which was the third most active season on record.

""The team predicts that 2022 hurricane activity will be about 130 percent of the average season from 1991-2020. By comparison, 2021's hurricane activity was about 120 percent of the average season,"" the report stated.

A forecast of 19 named storms for this coming season tops the past two years as the most named storms CSU has forecast in an April outlook.

""One of the reasons that we are forecasting more named storms than we have in prior years is that we are naming more storms now than we used to is due to technological improvements,"" Klotzbach explained.

Because of improvements in satellites, they are now able to detect weak storms that may have been missed even 20-30 years ago, Klotzbach added.

With the two previous years exhausting name lists, 2022 may add a third consecutive year to the record.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has a supplemental list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names just in case.

Reason behind the active Atlantic season

The primary factor contributing to an overactive season in the Atlantic is ""the likely absence of El Niño,"" according to the hurricane researchers at CSU.

The tropical Pacific is currently under weak La Niña conditions , a pattern known for cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator.

The phenomenon has impacts on weather around the globe.

La Niña presents favorable conditions for hurricanes in contrast to that of El Niño. Hurricane seasons under El Niño conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active.

""While La Niña may weaken and transition to neutral conditions by this summer, CSU does not currently anticipate El Niño for the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season,"" the report said.

The report added, ""the warmer Caribbean and eastern part of the subtropical Atlantic also favor an active 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.""

Tropical storms crave warm ocean water, which helps fuel their growth and development. It is one of the key reasons scientists say the climate crisis is changing hurricanes in the Atlantic. Warmer water and air can supercharge rainfall rates , making it more likely a landfalling hurricane will lead to disastrous flooding. Sea level rise has also increased storm surge damage.

""We know that, in general, hurricanes are intensifying faster,"" Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and professor at Texas Tech University, previously told CNN . ""They are bigger and stronger than they would be otherwise; they have a lot more rainfall associated with them, and rising sea level exacerbates storm surge.""

Although recent seasons have seen an increase in hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin, research has shown an overall decreasing trend in hurricanes globally since 1990.

""We ascribed the reason behind this to be due to a trend towards more frequent La Niñas and fewer El Niños over the past 30 years,"" Klotzbach told CNN, citing his recently published research

La Niña conditions tend to increase hurricane activity in the Atlantic, but decrease hurricane/typhoon activity in the Pacific basin, according to Klotzbach.

""Given that the Pacific is a much larger basin and generally spins up many more storms than the Atlantic, we've seen an overall trend towards fewer global hurricane-strength tropical cyclones despite the heightened activity we've observed in the Atlantic,"" Klotzbach said.

Stay ahead of hurricane season

""It only takes one storm near you to make this an active season,"" Michael Bell, professor in the CSU Department of Atmospheric Science, pointed out.

Coastal communities are warned to start making proper precautions for an active hurricane season now.

The best time to make a hurricane plan is when there is no hurricane! With 4 months until the start of the 2022 hurricane season, now is the time to 1) create an emergency plan, 2) determine whether you live in an evacuation zone, & 3) build a preparedness kit! #FLSWAW pic.twitter.com/7Y3TWgv0qH — NWS Melbourne (@NWSMelbourne) February 10, 2022

The probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the US coastline is 71%, well above the average of 52% for the past century, according to the report.

A greater than two-thirds chance of a major hurricane making landfall should inspire those in hurricane-prone areas to start taking action now. The damage from Category 4 Hurricane Ida , which battered the Gulf Coast in 2021, serves as a stark reminder of the power of major tropical cyclones.

Hurricane Ida left behind widespread destruction and flooding, as seen here in Point-Aux-Chenes, Louisiana.

Hurricane Preparedness Week is May 1-7, during which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) encourages people to determine their hurricane risk, make an evacuation plan, and gather emergency supplies in case of a hurricane affecting their area.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC), a branch of NOAA, is expected to release iits first five-day tropical outlook for the 2022 hurricane season May 15.

NOAA's Climate Prediction Center plans to issue its seasonal outlook May 24.

230,"Preparing for Category 6 hurricanes, a new facility will test winds of 200 mph and storm surge","A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.

(CNN) I lived and worked in Miami for four years before coming to Atlanta to join CNN . I've visited the Wall of Wind on the Florida International University (FIU) campus many times.

It is a wall of enormous fans inside a big warehouse-type building that can blow air up to 160 mph, which would be a Category 5 hurricane, to test infrastructure and research the power of wind.

The 12-fan Wall of Wind at Florida International University, one of the experimental facilities in National Science Foundation's Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure, that better enables engineering against tornadoes, hurricanes and other windstorms.

However, in our changing climate, sadly, 160 mph isn't strong enough. So, the National Science Foundation (NSF) just awarded a $12.8 million grant to FIU's Extreme Events Institute for the design of a full-scale testing facility capable of producing winds of 200 mph, along with a water basin to simulate storm surge and wave action in extreme winds.

FIU will be able to build a house under the current building codes, start up the fans and see if it can withstand 200 mph winds. Will the roof detach? Will the house still be standing at all?

The water basin will look like an enormous pool. It will also be able to simulate different coastlines. Storm surge tends to be worse when the coastlines are more shallow like along the Florida Panhandle. The facility will be able to simulate all of it.

""If you think about trying to future-proof, a changing hazard environment, a hazard scape, the US hazard scape with climate change, the past is not much of a guide. In fact, it can be deceiving,"" said Dr. Richard Olson, director of the Extreme Events Institute at FIU. ""So, if we're going to future-proof, we need to be able to research and test what future hazard events will look like. You can't future-proof in a changing environment if you're looking backwards.""

Tropical cyclones are getting stronger

It's true. Climate change is showing us storms are getting stronge r, moving slower and are holding more water than ever before. They are also rapidly intensifying, meaning the winds are increasing at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. In 2021, five hurricanes in the Atlantic rapidly intensified. And in 2020, TEN Atlantic hurricanes rapidly intensified. Dorian was one of those storms.

""Dorian in 2019 is the one that totally got my attention,"" said Olson. ""It hit 185 mph over the Bahamas, and until the last day and a half, it was heading straight up Eighth Street in Miami.""

Dorian ended up causing mass destruction across Abaco and Grand Bahama.

""The scientific consensus is that we're going to see more intense storms, so we have to research and test for more intense storms,"" said Olson. ""Otherwise, nature's going to keep hitting us with harder stuff than we're ready for.""

The facility will be the first of its kind in the world to combine wind speeds of greater magnitude along with a water component. Eventually the facility will be able to test how different types of infrastructure, roads, bridges will all respond with a Category 6 storm.

""We can start putting all of these components together to get a much better picture of what nature is going to be hitting us with,"" says Olson.

Yes, I realized I just referred to it as a Category 6 storm. And it might make some of you a little uncomfortable. To be honest, it bothers me a little bit too. But to be fair, if you look at the wind scale for the hurricanes, they are all -- more or less -- in about 20 mph increments.

When a Category 5 hurricane's wind speeds start at 157 mph, and we see storms with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph, it's a number that makes me go pale.

Since 2010, there have been 18 storms globally with recorded wind speeds of at least 178 mph at some point during their life span. Irma in 2017 and Dorian in 2019 were two storms in the Atlantic to meet the threshold.

It begs the question, especially for messaging purposes, do these types of storms need a special name? Category 6? Super-hurricane? Just something to put an exclamation point on how intense these specific storms are.

But the truth of the matter is, most people who die in hurricanes don't die from wind, but from water. I reached out to my friend, Dennis Feltgen, the public affairs officer at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) about whether he thought there would ever be a day in our future we would see a Category 6, and here is what he had to say:

""NHC has tried to steer the focus toward the individual hazards, which include storm surge, wind, rainfall, tornadoes and rip currents, instead of the particular category of the storm, which only provides information about the hazard from wind. Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale already captures 'Catastrophic Damage' from wind, so it's not clear that there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger. In addition, most deaths in tropical cyclones occur not from the wind but from water -- storm surge, rainfall/inland flooding, and hazardous surf -- causing about 90 percent of tropical cyclone deaths in the United States. So, we don't want to overemphasize the wind hazard by placing too much emphasis on the category.""

I do agree with Dennis, but I also think as storms become stronger, wetter and slower, there might be a day the category system evolves from what it is now, just as the EF scale or Fujita scale was enhanced in 2007. And by the way, the same facility will also test tornado and thunderstorm winds.

There are a few research facilities studying extreme winds. Watch the video below to see what 100 mph winds can do to a house.

""I think the interaction between the various components of hurricanes, the waves, the flooding, the currents, and the wind, the debris, all of that, it's very important to simulate that as practically as possible,"" said Dr. Arindam Gan Chowdhury, professor of environmental engineering at FIU. ""Everything is not possible to replicate Mother Nature. But the closer we can get, the better we can learn.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/weather/category-6-hurricane-wxn/index.html
231,Atlantic hurricane season ends up as more costly than the record-breaking one in 2020,"(CNN) The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, just like the 2020 season, was one for the record books -- but for different reasons.

The biggest similarity was the high number of named storms. The 2021 season became only the third in history to use all of the names on the rotating seasonal list (the previous years were 2020 and 2005).

We ended the season with 21 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). During an average year there would be 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. This year met or exceeded each of those categories, and it was forecast to be that way. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.

There were four major hurricanes this season: Grace, Ida, Larry, and Sam. The strongest two were Ida and Sam, which both reached Category 4 strength. Grace and Larry peaked as Category 3 storms.

The first half of the season was off to the races -- as the US was impacted by eight named storms: Claudette, Danny, Elsa, Fred, Henri, Ida, Mindy, and Nicholas.

Then, suddenly, the world's oceans became eerily quiet. After September 25 the Atlantic and the rest of the world would struggle to produce a named storm.

That was not what meteorologists expected.



Both last year and this year were observed during the last several weeks of the season, which typically favors late season tropical activity. 2020 saw three named storms in November (Eta, Theta, and Iota) and 2021 saw just one (Wanda) during the first few days. ""The globe has had no major (Category 3+, max winds >=111 mph) hurricane/typhoon/cyclone formations since September 25. All other hurricane seasons in the satellite era (since 1966) have had at least two global major hurricane formations between September 26 - November 19,"" Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University, said in a tweet Both last year and this year La Niña conditions were observed during the last several weeks of the season, which typically favors late season tropical activity. 2020 saw three named storms in November (Eta, Theta, and Iota) and 2021 saw just one (Wanda) during the first few days.

How this hurricane season ended marks one of the biggest differences between this year and last.

Klotzbach explained that usually La Niña weakens or limits vertical wind shear, but surprisingly there was quite elevated wind shear in the Caribbean in October and November -- the focal region for storms late in the season -- and that led to a quiet latter part of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.

While an active season was predicted, it's impossible to know in advance exactly where each storm will go and what kind of damage it may cause.

A ""bad"" season is all about perspective. Central American countries may consider this to have been a ""good"" year since not a single named storm hit any part of the region. In 2020 , Central America was hit by three named storms, two of which were major hurricanes.

In the US, the state of Louisiana can't seem to catch a break. In 2020, the Pelican State was impacted by five named storms : Cristobal, Laura, Marco, Delta and Zeta. This year the state was impacted by three named storms: Claudette, Ida and Nicholas.

In 2020 more hurricanes made landfall in the US, but this year the storms cost over $20 billion more.

Billions in damage

While only one major hurricane made landfall across the US (Ida), a total of four named storms left behind over $1 billion in damage each: Tropical Storm Elsa, Tropical Storm Fred, Hurricane Ida , and Hurricane Nicholas.

Ida alone exceeded the cost in damage of all seven billion-dollar tropical cyclones that made landfall across the US in 2020, including hurricanes like Laura, Delta, and Zeta.

""To date, Hurricane Ida is the costliest disaster this year -- exceeding $60 billion,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . ""Ida already ranks among the top-five most costly hurricanes on record for the US since 1980.""

Ida was the strongest Atlantic hurricane of the year to make landfall with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph when it struck near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on August 29. It was one of only three hurricanes to ever make landfall in the state of Louisiana with winds of 150 mph, the most recent being Laura from 2020.

""Grand Isle, Louisiana took a direct hit with 100% of its homes damaged and nearly 40% were nearly-to-completely destroyed,"" according to NOAA . ""There was heavy damage to the energy infrastructure across southern Louisiana causing widespread, long duration power outages to millions of people.""

In the following days the remnants of Ida moved to the Northeast and combined with a frontal system, delivering extreme rainfall rates and flash flooding, inundating streets, homes and neighborhoods.

Flash flood emergencies were declared in New Jersey and New York . At least 55 people died across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

This season's quirks

The strongest storm of the season didn't hit land but video was captured from inside it.

Hurricane Sam, like Ida, also reached Category 4 strength with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph. Sam remained a Category 4 hurricane for 4.5 days and generated the fifth-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) recorded in the satellite era.

""ACE is integrated metric accounting for storm intensity and duration,"" Klotzbach tweeted . ""Sam was a long-lived, intense hurricane.""

Fortunately, unlike Ida, Sam remained out over the open waters of the Atlantic and never made landfall.

Sam's long life, of over 11 days as a hurricane, allowed a research drone to be sailed into it, and, for the first time, to transmit video from inside a major hurricane at ocean level.

A couple of other storms made some meteorological records.

Tropical Storm Ana formed in a unique area of the Atlantic Ocean. In the last 100 years, no named storm had ever developed east of Bermuda in the month of May . Tropical Storm Ana broke that record. Typically, storms during this month form over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, western Caribbean Sea and near the southeastern US coast.

Another unique storm was Subtropical Storm Teresa. Reports of subtropical storms are not uncommon, especially in the 21st century, thanks to advanced technology. What is uncommon is for a storm to remain subtropical for its entire life, never transitioning to ""tropical"" status.

Teresa was also extremely short-lived, at only 24 hours. Subtropical Storm Teresa formed on Friday, September 24, at 5 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time. Exactly 24 hours later, the NHC issued its final advisory as Teresa became a remnant, low-pressure system.

Ida will likely be the only name on the retired list this year, despite there being three other major hurricanes, simply because of the amount of damage and fatalities caused. The letter ""I"" already has more retired names than any other letter in the alphabet.

There are already 12 retired storm names that start with the letter ""I"", and Ida will likely become the 13th.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/30/weather/weather-2021-atlantic-hurricane-season/index.html
232,What a hurricane means when you live in Louisiana's 'Cancer Alley',"(CNN) Milton Cayette Jr. was stuck in his home in St. James Parish after uprooted trees from Hurricane Ida blocked his driveway and damaged his front door. Cayette, who uses a wheelchair, called parish officials for help. They never came.

Parish officials, however, told CNN that they did not receive calls that match Cayette's situation, adding that the government is ""by law, not allowed to enter or conduct work on private property unless it is an emergency life saving measure."" It wasn't until two days later when a group of volunteers from New Orleans came to saw and remove the trees that he was able to go outside.

""I've seen it all,"" Cayette, a retired industry worker, told CNN. ""After Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the chemical plants started building and operating. A lot of them. It all changed.""

About 50 miles away in St. John the Baptist Parish, Robert Taylor Jr., executive director of Concerned Citizens of St. John, said many residents were trapped in their attics after the storm while others witnessed their roofs being ripped off by Ida.

The lack of emergency response after the hurricane, Taylor said, is just another example of the neglect the community has long suffered. Residents say the government failed to prepare the community for the storm by not issuing an evacuation order earlier or assisting poor and vulnerable residents who could not manage to flee their homes, like Cayette.

""The government is obviously failing us and not protecting us,"" said Taylor, who evacuated from St. John before Hurricane Ida hit. ""And this just pushed it over the top.""

Milton Cayette Jr. was stuck in his home for two days before fallen trees could be cleared.

The predominantly Black community of St. John and the nearly majority Black population of St. James sit at the heart of Louisiana's ""Cancer Alley,"" the 85-mile stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's home to more than 150 chemical plants and oil refineries. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2019 environmental justice data eight of the nation's top 14 block groups — census areas that typically contain 600 to 3,000 people — with the country's estimated highest cancer risks are in St. John.

Until recently, Cayette, who has lived in the region for 70 years and previously worked at a nearby petrochemical plant, never connected the growth of the chemical industry to the region's suddenly high cancer rates. But then his wife died of breast cancer a few years ago -- and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer on top of his diabetes. Now, he lives alone with the sight of industrial facilities looming outside his window.

""I was mad and disappointed at the government,"" Cayette said about the lack of response after Ida. ""What concerned me even more is that I'm disabled, but they couldn't come to help.""

For decades, scientists have claimed the planet has been rapidly warming because of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels. Days after Ida ravaged the homes of vulnerable residents in Louisiana and Mississippi, the EPA released an analysis concluding that racial and ethnic minority communities disproportionately suffer the most severe consequences of climate change, indicating they are the least able to prepare for, and recover from, extreme climate events such as pollution, flooding and heat waves.

People work to repair a roof in Norco, Louisiana.

If the planet reaches the critical warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius -- which most countries are careening toward unless they drastically cut emitting greenhouse gases from fossil fuels -- the report warns that Black people are projected to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis.

""It's absolutely an insult that the companies that are responsible for this are also the ones that are driving climate change,"" Naomi Yoder, staff scientist at the Healthy Gulf, a group working to restore natural resources in the region, told CNN. ""They're also one of the biggest drivers of land loss in Louisiana, which makes the effects of hurricanes worse.""

Compounding crises during a pandemic

The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both parishes especially hard. In April 2020, St. John had the highest death rate per capita for Covid-19 in the United States, surpassing even the most densely populated urban hotspots. Around that time in St. James, the Covid-19 death rate was also five times higher than the overall national death rate.

The Holy Rosary Cemetery in Hahnville, Louisiana, sits next to a Dow chemical plant.

More than a year later, with the pandemic persisting, Category 4 Hurricane Ida threw the area's high cancer and Covid-19 rates and underlying environmental health hazards, which come from the area's rampant pollution from fossil fuel industries, into harsh relief.

""It's just risk on top of risk on top of risk,"" Kimberly Terrell, director of community engagement at the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic, told CNN. ""There's always air pollution coming out of industrial facilities, and these communities have been burdened with that for decades.""

The Rev. Lionel Murphy, pastor of Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John, said the storm left devastating damage to his church along with homes and other buildings in the parish, exacerbating the emotional and physical toll that air pollution and health disparities have placed on communities.

""If only we can get some attention,"" Murphy said, referring to public officials and emergency responders. ""The people are going to leave and come back, but this storm aggravates so much else because Covid is pretty strong in St. John.""

The Tchoupitoulas Chapel in St. John was damaged by Hurricane Ida.

Terrell wanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley. In the early months of the pandemic, Harvard's school of public health released a preliminary study showing a link between fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 pollution, and increased mortality rates from Covid-19.Terrellwanted to know what that meant for Louisiana, particularly in Cancer Alley. After scraping the raw data from the Harvard study and performing her own analysis, she found that the highest death rates from Covid-19 and a majority of PM 2.5 concentrations were in Cancer Alley.

Ida added another layer of affliction by destroying houses and forcing residents to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, where they may be clustered together with potential for increased Covid-19 transmission.

""It seems like these communities are just continually burdened with risks that they didn't ask for, and don't deserve to be burdened with,"" Terrell said.

The current 7-day average is more than 42 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 in St. John and more than 177 new cases per 100,000 in St. James, according to data from Johns Hopkins University . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes St. John and St. James as a community with high levels of Covid-19 transmission.

Many residents across Louisiana are still enduring power outages.

Taylor said he worries that residents who have been sickened by cancer as well as Covid-19 won't get the medical care they need after having to evacuate because of Ida's impacts. Some are being transported to shelters where they could potentially spread Covid-19 or even contract it, he said, echoing Terrell's concern.

Prior to Ida, at least 16% of residents in St. James Parish and St. John Parish were living below the poverty line, according to Census data.

""This is a mess,"" Taylor told CNN. ""I don't see how poor people are expected to survive this.""

Living next to an industrial facility

The proliferation of petrochemical facilities and oil refineries throughout Cancer Alley has become a familiar sight to residents along the industrial corridor. Cayette said he remembers industrial facilities emerging after Category 4 Hurricane Betsy pummeled the region in 1965. But it was only recently that residents began to realize the invisible danger the industry caused on public health and the ironic effects it has on the climate.

When a hurricane is barreling toward an industry-heavy region, petrochemical facilities and oil refineries typically begin to shutter their plants, which involves burning anywhere from hundreds to millions of pounds of hazardous materials. As part of emergency shutdown procedures, these facilities emit or burn various unprocessed chemicals and gases through a process known as flaring. Oftentimes, Yoder said, the emissions continue to escape even after the hurricane has knocked out power lines.

A damaged trailer is seen in Reserve, Louisiana, a town in St. John the Baptist Parish.

""This is not something new to these communities, and it's not necessarily even unique to a disaster situation,"" Terrell said of refineries emitting toxic compounds. ""It seems like consistently the people who are breathing these toxins are the last to find out about it.""

In St. Charles Parish, for instance, a Shell Norco manufacturing complex has been spewing residual gases as residents pick through the rubble of Hurricane Ida's aftermath. After the storm, the EPA contacted Shell about the excessive smoke and reports of noxious gas coming out of its refinery. In a report, officials noted that Shell is conducting ""community air monitoring"" and ""looking at all options to try to reduce emissions to flare.""

""While the site is safe and secure, we are experiencing elevated flaring due to a lack of steam generation,"" Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesperson, told CNN. ""Crews are working around the clock to complete repairs and we are making good progress on minimizing flaring until power is restored.""

In St. James Parish, residents like Sharon Lavigne have been fighting new petrochemical plants attempting to set up shop in their community. Five years ago, Lavigne was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Blood tests revealed that she had aluminum inside her body, which she later blamed on the slew of industrial facilities after attending a few environmental justice workshops.

Sharon Lavigne's home was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ida.

Angered by what she learned about the industry growing in her backyard, Lavigne founded RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice group trying to stop any new industrial development in Cancer Alley, which Cayette is also a member of.

""My grandparents lived on this land. They bought this land and lived on it,"" Lavigne told CNN. ""And then when I got married, I built a house on this land.""

And while Formosa tried to push ahead with its construction during the pandemic, RISE St. James fought hard to block the company, delaying the construction further. The US Army Corps of Engineers early this year ordered Formosa to conduct a new environmental review of the petrochemical facility, thanks to legal complaints, protests and lawsuits from environmental groups like RISE St. James.

While the battle to block the multibillion-dollar facility isn't over, Hurricane Ida added to the community's problems. The storm tore Lavigne's roof and caused her ceiling to collapse, just like it did to many other houses in the parish.

A sign protesting the planned Formosa plant is seen next to a downed tree on Sharon Lavigne's property.

""So many of us suffered damages from Ida,"" Lavigne said, ""so after RISE members rebuild, we're going to help the rest of the community.""

Cancer Alley has faced many disasters, but none as challenging as a hurricane, air pollution and pandemic happening at once. To Cayette and Lavigne, living next to industrial facilities is a death sentence. It may take years for the community to recover, but Lavigne said they've been victorious before. As long as the fossil fuel industry continues to warm the planet and pollute their backyards, she said grassroots organizations will keep fighting.

""People tell me they're glad we're fighting the industry,"" she said.

""Many tell me they can't be out there to help me, but they're praying for me. That was nice.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/06/us/hurricane-ida-cancer-alley-pollution/index.html
233,Here's why hurricane hunters fly their planes in weird patterns into storms,"(CNN) The second half of hurricane season is here and there have already been 17 named storms to keep hurricane hunters busy. But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters' flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes?

Those flight patterns may look like boxes or stars, but they serve specific purposes for each individual storm.

Hurricane hunters don't fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do. They fly directly into them, but they don't just fly into and around the storms randomly. There is a method to the madness.

There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF). Both organizations fly missions into tropical disturbances in order to record invaluable data used by forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC).

For the Hurricane Hunters, there are two main types of missions flown, fixed and invest.

Fixed missions

Fixed missions are designated for systems that meet tropical cyclone qualifications, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. The main objective is to mark the center of circulation, monitor winds speeds and pressure changes, and other variables that are tricky for satellites in space to measure in full detail.

For fixed missions, 'Alpha' is most common flight pattern used to collect data in a tropical cyclone.

""The Alpha pattern is the standard profile we fly for fix missions so it's the one people are most familiar with seeing from us,"" Maj. Jeremy DeHart , meteorologist and aerial reconnaissance weather officer with the Air Force Reserve's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron , said. ""The pattern consists of two legs flown at intercardinal directions, and when complete, looks a lot like the Greek Alpha symbol when including the crossleg.""

Cardinal directions are the standard points on a compass: north, south, east, and west. Intercardinal directions are the diagonal points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.

Interestingly, the bigger, stronger storms tend to be the ""easier"" ones to fly in.

""From my perspective as the onboard meteorologist, the Alpha pattern is the ""easiest"" to fly. Because we normally fly those on stronger storms, there's not a lot of question where the storm center is,"" DeHart said. ""The flights can be rough of course, but at the end of the day we just go fly through the storm center, collect the data, and send it to NHC.""

Invest missions

The primary objective of an invest mission is to determine if a system meets the definition of a tropical cyclone; storms that do not yet have a name or any real tropical structure characteristics.

For invest missions, the NHC will often send estimated coordinates of where they believe the center of circulation is, which is where the missions will target for their starting point.

However, invest missions by nature have to be a bit more flexible for flight patterns, simply because there are so many unknowns with these types of storms.

""We never know what we're going to find, yet we always have to be thinking two or three steps ahead. So that really makes us need to think about the meteorology [in each particular storm],"" DeHart said. ""Is it a closed low or an open wave? Maybe it's closed but just elongated? Is it battling shear? Are there several smaller swirls competing to be the main circulation center? Weak storms and invests can be very tricky and require a lot of thinking on our toes.""

Air Force Hurricane Hunters have a variety of flight patterns to choose from for invest missions: X, Delta, and Box, just to name a few.

DeHart explains the missions are ideal for the weaker, more uncertain storms. While the X pattern may resemble the Alpha pattern, it is flown at much lower altitudes, usually around 500 to 1,000 feet.

""Once a system becomes a tropical storm or hurricane, the hurricane hunters begin flying at higher altitudes, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet depending on the severity of the storm,"" said Jessica Kendziorek, public affairs operations chief with the USAF 403rd Wing.

Flight levels for the Delta and Box patterns are usually at or below 5,000 ft absolute altitude.

""The Delta and Box patterns are similar in that we'll fly around the periphery of the forecast center seeing if we can observe winds in all four quadrants of the storm that would indicate a closed circulation. If we find a closed circulation, we can confidently go [find] the center; if not, we'll continue the mission in 'invest mode',"" DeHart said.

NOAA focuses on research

NOAA Hurricane Hunters also fly operational fixed and invest missions (though the names may be different), but they usually have more research-oriented objectives. They fly many unique flight patterns , with different types of aircraft, depending on what type of mission is assigned.

Hurricane Hunters also fly a third type of mission, which the Air Force rarely flies, according to DeHart, called synoptic missions.

For fixed missions NOAA often flies a Figure 4, Rotated Figure 4 pattern, or a Butterfly pattern.

""The Butterfly and Figure 4 patterns flown by the WP-3D through the storm are typically the ones used to [find] the center of circulation,"" said Jonathan Shannon, public affairs specialist for the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center Office of Marine and Aviation Operations.

The Rotated Figure 4 pattern is as it sounds; the Figure 4 pattern turned on side.

""The goal with every flight is to gather data all around the center of the storm, and those patterns allow us to efficiently fly through a storm's various quadrants,"" Nick Underwood, NOAA Hurricane Hunter, said. ""This data helps with predicting a storm's intensity, as well as determining exactly where the center is.""

For invest missions, the Lawnmower and Square Spiral patterns are flown, to determine if there are actual tropical characteristics associated with the area in which they are investigating.

""The Lawnmower Pattern allows us to map out a large area when we don't have a center to aim for,"" Paul Flaherty, science branch chief at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center, said. ""Once we are able to map a full circulation (usually by finding a west wind), we'll shift back to Figure 4's based on that newly identified center position.""

The Square Spiral pattern is a survey mission meant to supply observations on the structure and characteristics including information about the vortex center, if it exists.

There is a unique third type of mission flight pattern, often used to sample the surrounding atmosphere which helps forecasters know the direction the storm is likely to go.

The Star 1 pattern focuses on a scan of the outer edges of the system. The closely-related Star 2 pattern also does an outer scan of the system, while also adding in a circumference loop near the center of circulation.

Recently, NOAA's Gulfstream IV flew a Star-2 pattern around Hurricane Larry, to investigate outflow patterns from the storm and better determine where the storm was headed.

""The flight pattern you'll typically see from our Gulfstream IV is a circumnavigation of the storm itself, as well as sampling of the atmosphere around and ahead of the storm,"" Underwood said. ""This data helps with predicting the storm's track.""

Regardless of which entity is flying, the operational missions are the backbone for the National Hurricane Center, tasked with providing essential life-saving information about a storm.

234,Hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. Here’s why,"Here’s what scientists are most confident is happening to hurricanes as a result of climate change, what they think might be occurring and the biggest questions about how these massive storms are changing that remain unanswered.

While scientists are still learning exactly how this added heat is changing hurricanes, research shows that the storms are becoming more destructive in some key ways.

Though global temperature data goes back over 150 years, hurricane records are actually very sparse prior to the 1970s, when satellites first began capturing images of all of the world’s oceans.

In 1961, Hurricane Esther became the first storm to be recorded by a weather satellite.

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record , and many of the storms that slammed into the Gulf Coast, Central America and the Caribbean this year exhibited hallmark signs that they were supercharged by global warming.

Over the last two-plus centuries, human activity — mainly the burning of fossil fuels – has added lots of heat to the oceans and air where these storms are spawned.

This heat energy is converted into lashing winds and driving rainfall that can bring devastating impacts when they hit cities, homes and infrastructure.

Known outside of North America as tropical cyclones or typhoons, hurricanes are essentially massive engines of wind and rain that are fueled by warm ocean water and air.

Hurricanes are the most violent storms on the planet. The names of the most damaging ones live on because of the devastation they left in their wake.

And when storm surge strikes a developed coastline, the cost in both lives and property can be enormous.

When a storm’s winds blow onshore, they can send feet of water rushing inland at depths far greater than even the most extreme high tides.

Storm surge is the rapid rise in ocean levels brought about by the powerful winds and low pressure in a hurricane.

Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds, but the most deadly and destructive threat posed by most hurricanes is the storm surge they can produce .

What scientists know for sure

Note: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.

With global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.

With global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.

Already, storm surge has gotten worse because sea levels are rising - and fast.

Sea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland storm surge can travel.

During the height of Hurricane Dorian , Michael Pintard, Bahamas’ Minister of Agriculture, recorded this video from the second story of his house. Water is seen lapping against the windows, which he estimates in the video to be nearly 20 feet high.

While no tide gauge measurements were available in the hardest-hit parts of the Bahamas when Hurricane Dorian struck in 2019, witnesses reported that the storm put parts of the islands under as much as 20 feet of water .

Scientists now say sea levels could rise by more than three feet by 2100.

As sea levels continue to rise this century, the storm surge risk to the city will also grow.

Here's what 2 feet of sea level rise would look like.

But with 1 foot of sea level rise, parts of it would be underwater.

Low-lying cities like Charleston, South Carolina, are already vulnerable to storm surge.

However, there have been several recent storms that provide anecdotal evidence.

But because observation stations that monitor rainfall are sparse and hurricane satellite data only goes back a few decades, we can’t yet draw conclusions about how much climate change has affected rainfall, said Kossin.

Computer models consistently show that hurricane rainfall is increasing already, as one would expect as the planet warms.

That would mean that in a world warmed by two degrees Celsius, you would have, on average, around 14% more water vapor in the atmosphere.

“Simply put, warmer air holds more water vapor,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist at NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information.

The increase in hurricane rainfall can be explained by physics — specifically, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which holds that for each degree Celsius of warming, 7% more water vapor should be available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain.

In the Southeastern US alone, the annual cost of storm surge damage is projected to grow to $56 billion by 2050 , according to the US government’s 2018 National Climate Assessment. And that’s even if global emissions of heat-trapping gases are moderately curbed in the next two decades.

Generally speaking, a rise in sea levels of 2 to 3 feet would mean that a Category 1 hurricane could be capable of inflicting the kind of storm surge damage we would expect today from a Category 2 storm.

If humans continue to emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, scientists expect that sea levels will climb even higher , putting major cities at an even greater risk.

“This is making the storms more dangerous as it leads to higher inundation levels,” said Tom Knutson, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who leads the agency’s weather and climate dynamics division.

This added heat is likely allowing hurricanes to pack even greater wind speeds.

What scientists think they know

The following year, Hurricane Florence swamped parts of North Carolina with nearly three feet of rain , shattering the state’s previous record for tropical storm rainfall.

Hurricane Michael, which made landfall as a Category 5 storm on Oct. 10, 2018, underwent rapid intensification before striking the Florida panhandle.

“If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly,” said Kossin.

Rapid intensification is when a storm quickly gains strength – officially, a storm has undergone rapid intensification if its wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period.

And as warming reaches deeper and deeper stretches of the world’s oceans, scientists believe that storms are more likely to undergo “rapid intensification.”

As human activity warms up the planet, the extra heat isn’t just confined to the ocean’s surface — it extends hundreds of meters deep , providing extra heat energy for hurricanes to use for fuel.

Other variables — like the presence of El Nino and La Nina conditions – can also cause significant swings in how hurricanes form around the world. Because of this, scientists say more data is needed before we can say with certainty how climate change will impact hurricanes’ strength now and in the future.

“Almost all of the damage and mortality caused by hurricanes is done by major hurricanes (Category 3 to 5),” Kossin said. “Increasing the likelihood of having a major hurricane will certainly increase this risk.”

With stronger storms, there’s also a greater chance for severe damage and destruction when hurricanes collide with towns and cities.

“The prevailing consensus is that we likely won’t see more storms in the future (maybe even fewer), but that these storms may be stronger,” Klotzbach said. “If you look at the (hurricane) trend since 1980 (when reliable data became available), there’s a huge increasing trend in Category 4s and 5s.”

Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who monitors and analyzes hurricane trends across the globe, draws similar conclusions about how climate change is increasing hurricanes’ strength.

“The change is about 8% per decade,” Kossin said. “In other words, during its lifetime, a hurricane is 8% more likely to be a major hurricane in this decade compared to the last decade.”

In a study released earlier this year examining nearly 40 years of available satellite data , Kossin and his co-authors found that the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status (Category 3 or above with winds in excess of 110 mph or higher), increased decade after decade.

“The stronger storms are getting stronger,” he warned, “and the stronger storms are becoming more frequent.”

“But that is not what is really important,” Kossin said. The added heat in the oceans is “increasing the speed limit for storms,” raising the maximum intensity that storms can achieve.

“We have relatively high confidence that storms will get stronger,” said Kossin. Both he and Knutson estimated the increase in the wind speeds to be between about 3% and 4% per degree Celsius of warming.

While some recent research has shown this trend, scientists say not enough historical data exists to say how much more common rapid intensification has become.

Then in November, Hurricanes Eta and Iota both rapidly gained strength before making landfall in Central America just weeks apart, with Iota becoming the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua . The fact that there were water temperatures warm enough to allow both storms to rapidly intensify this late in the season is a clear signal of global warming, Klotzbach said.

Three of the most damaging hurricanes to strike the US in 2020 — Hanna, Laura and Sally — all rapidly intensified before making landfall.

From satellite imagery, you can see how Michael’s eye quickly became more defined and organized as it approached the coast, a sign that the storm was gaining strength:

All this extra heat gives hurricanes more fuel to gain strength rapidly.

But as the planet has warmed, heat in the ocean now extends further below the surface.

Wind and rain churn up the ocean below a hurricane, causing cooler waters from the depths to mix with warmer, surface water. This tends to limit how much a storm can strengthen.

Hurricanes are fueled by heat energy from warm ocean waters. As a storm moves over the ocean, it pulls in energy from the water's surface.

“The tropics are expanding — so it seems to reason that the tropical cyclones would be able to extend further into the mid-latitudes,” Kossin said, “and when we looked at the data were able to see this shift.”

According to Kossin, who has published multiple studies on the topic, there is a growing body of evidence that there “has been a systematic shift in the storm track that is not easily explained by natural causes.” In the Northern Hemisphere, this means storms are tracking further north and in the Southern Hemisphere, further south.

Though scientists say more evidence is needed, some findings in recent years show that more storms are reaching their peak intensities closer to the poles, potentially putting more cities within range of a major hurricane landfall.

An identical storm will produce much more destruction if it makes landfall in a major coastal city in the mid-latitudes – say New York, Shanghai or Brisbane — than if it slams into a sparsely populated coastline elsewhere.

To borrow a real estate adage, it’s “location, location, location” that also determines just how much damage a hurricane or typhoon can inflict.

What scientists are just starting to learn

“We used to observe storms less frequently and with satellites that had lower resolution, and consequently, we likely couldn’t measure rapid intensification as well as we can now,” Klotzbach told CNN.

Klotzbach also noted that while the data shows an increase in the number of storms that have rapidly intensified, it also shows an increasing number of storms have rapidly weakened — indicating the increases could also be a function of advances in the amount and quality of data we are now able to collect on storms.

This shift in where storms strike could have an even larger impact on the threats hurricanes pose than increases in storm intensity due to climate change, Kossin said.

Major cities that do not have a history of dealing with tropical storms, especially at or near peak intensity, could be seeing them on a more regular basis in future decades, Kossin said.

Heavily populated shorelines in northeastern China and Japan are seeing storms with 2 to 3 times the frequency they were in earlier decades, while low-lying archipelagos like the Philippines are seeing storms less frequently than we’d expect, he said.

The one place where hurricane tracking data hasn’t shown much of a northward shift is in the Atlantic Basin.

Most scientists, Kossin included, attribute this to some longer-term variabilities that are both natural and human caused. Kossin believes the Atlantic will likely see this poleward shift in the track of storms too, but so far, it has not materialized.

More storms are stalling. That’s a big problem

The slower a storm moves, the more time its winds and rain can inflict damage.

In 2019, Hurricane Dorian’s devastating crawl across the Bahamas slowed to 1 mph, slower than the speed at which most humans walk. The slowdown kept the island of Grand Bahama in Dorian’s eye for more than nine hours.

The lashing winds and torrential downpours from Hurricanes Harvey and Florence also slowed to a crawl on land.

As the planet warms, scientists say more and more storms appear to be experiencing this slowdown, increasing the amount of time locations in their path are exposed to dangerous conditions.

Between 1944 and 2017, 66 storms have stalled in the north Atlantic Basin, and nearly two-thirds of those occurred within the final 25 years of the study, suggesting a trend towards slower-moving storms, according to a 2019 study from Kossin and co-author Timothy Hall.

But the phenomenon isn’t just confined to the Atlantic Basin.

His 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature found that the forward speed of hurricanes decreased by 10% globally between 1949 and 2016, though there is some variation in different ocean basins.

The study also found a 20% to 30% slowdown over land areas affected by North Atlantic and North Pacific tropical cyclones, respectively.

The western north Pacific Basin, which sees the most storms annually, has also seen the most slowing, while storms in the northern Indian Ocean do not appear to be slowing down yet.

Overall, tropical cyclones have slowed more in the Northern Hemisphere, which is where a majority of storms occur each year.

There is considerable evidence that global summertime circulation patterns in the atmosphere are slowing as a result of global warming. Kossin believes this may also be putting the brakes on hurricane movement, but cautioned that the connection between climate and stalling is still unclear.

Some scientists think other variables may be at play.

Other natural climate variations — such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation – can also influence hurricane formation over long periods of time.

This study did not account for these natural cycles, which could be behind much of the observed trend, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/12/us/hurricanes-climate-change/
235,The man who bought a cruise ship on Craigslist,"(CNN) — It's not every day that you spot a cruise ship for sale on Craigslist. So Chris Willson was immediately intrigued when he stumbled across a 293-foot vessel listed on the classified advertisements website back in 2008.

The retired ""pocket"" cruise ship, built in Germany, was moored in the California Delta at the time, and its then owner was keen to offload it.

After seeing the listing pop up numerous times Willson, who was working on developing virtual reality tours, decided to do some investigating.

""I kind of posed as a potential buyer, even though I really didn't have any interest in purchasing a ship,"" Willson tells CNN Travel. ""It was a little out of my comfort level, to say the least.""

Once he made the trip down to the inland river delta and estuary in Northern California and stepped onboard, Willson was struck by how badly the 2,496 gross ton ship had been neglected over the years.

However, as he began to explore further, he realized that there was a pretty impressive five-level vessel beneath all the ""junk"" on board.

Sealing the deal

Chris Willson and his partner Jin Li now live on board the cruise ship he bought in 2008. Christopher Willson

""She has one of the most spectacular layouts of just about any ship I've seen,"" he adds. ""The staircases are magnificent.

""It's almost the same as if you found an old '60s Corvette in the garage. You can see the quality is there, but it's so neglected, you almost feel bad for it.""

After doing some digging into the background of the ship, he discovered that it was constructed by the Blohm and Voss shipyard in 1955, and had been the first significant passenger liner built by Germany after World War II.

The more he learned about the ship, which was originally named Wappen von Hamburg, the more convinced he became that this was a project he was willing to take on.

After carefully considering the enormity of what it would mean to own a mini cruise ship, Willson put together a restoration plan and decided to take the plunge.

While he's loath to discuss the amount he paid, he says he was able to ""work out a really good deal with the owner of the vessel.""

""The next thing you know, I own a ship,"" Willson adds.

But once he'd signed on the dotted line, he had to figure out where he was going to put it. Thankfully, Willson was able to secure a lease in the California river city of Rio Vista and arranged for the ship to be towed there.

Passion project

Willson has been working on the ship, which is moored at a marina in Little Potato Slough, California, with the help of volunteers. Christopher Willson

That's when the restoration process began. The first step was getting rid of all of the trash on board -- Willson says there were hundreds of bags worth of household type garbage along with old mattresses and blankets -- and setting about finding volunteers to help.

""I figured it was going to be a long project,"" says Willson. ""The scale of it was massive. It's almost the same as redoing 15 houses all by yourself.""

After spending a few months traveling for around three hours from his home in Santa Cruz to work on the ship, Willson decided to move on board with his partner Jin Li so that he could fully focus on the project, as well as keep it secure.

""When I first moved aboard many of my friends and family were in disbelief,"" he admits. ""It was a rather large change in lifestyle. ""But I view it as more of an upgrade, although we are off grid and running on mainly generators and solar grids.""

As he began digging further into the history of the ship, Willson says he learned that, not only had it been the inspiration for popular TV series ""The Love Boat,"" it was also the filming location for the Spectre criminal organization headquarters in the 1963 James Bond movie ""From Russia with Love.""

The vessel served as a cruise ship for around two decades, he says, and went through several different owners, as well as names, before being moored in Vancouver.

After a few false starts and more ownership and name changes, it was towed to Alameda, California in 2005. Plans were put in place to turn it into a luxury yacht, but they ultimately fell through.

The ship remained at Alameda for several years until it was bought by a businessman and moved to the California Delta. The vessel was thought to be on the verge of being scrapped when Willson saw it advertised on Craiglist in 2008.

Historic vessel

""The more I learned about the history, I was thinking that it could be a shore side attraction, kind of like the Queen Mary [a retired ocean liner moored at Long Beach that's now a popular tourist attraction],"" he explains. ""I'd like to make a museum out of it and let people do tours [of the ship].""

He estimates that it would cost around $3 million to transform the vessel into a shoreside attraction.

Willson, who had no prior experience working on ships, has spent around 14 years renovating the ship, with the help of volunteers.

""I'm pretty crafty,"" he says, explaining that he'd rebuilt lots of cars in the past and previously worked as an electrical mechanical engineer doing disaster recovery.

He renamed the vessel the Aurora after spending his first night on board.

""I woke up to one of the most brilliant sunrises I had ever seen,"" Willson explains. ""It was forming an Aurora type effect with the clouds and water. I remember thinking at that time 'Aurora' was a fitting name.""

With the help of volunteers, along with Li, who Willson says has played a key role in helping to preserve the Aurora, he's completed renovations on some of the passageways, as well as a lounge and a number of cabins.

""Our biggest achievement has been removing the old wood from the decks and spending a massive amount of time welding in new steel plates to completely seal the decks,"" he says.

""It's not so much the working on the ship that's the biggest challenge, it's dealing with the politics behind it. Does the county or the city want your ship there?""

After a few years in Rio Vista, Willson was offered a berth in San Francisco's Pier 38 and moved the Aurora there. However, things didn't work out as he expected and Willson was later asked to find a new home for the ship.

He had it transferred back to the California Delta in 2012, mooring the Aurora at a marina in Little Potato Slough, located around 24 kilometers from the city of Stockton in California's Central Valley.

Aurora has been stationed ""in fresh shallow water"" here ever since and looks set to remain for the foreseeable future.

Although the ship is unable to sail, Willson stresses that it has a ""solid bottom,"" and after consulting with a number of maritime engineers, he's confident that, ""with proper maintenance and supervision,"" it can safely remain where it is.

""As long as we don't take it out where there's a lot of electrolysis and things like that,"" he adds. ""She is safe for the time being but we have plans to move her closer to the bay when she is further along in her restoration.""

He hopes to raise enough funding to pull the ship out of the water and redo the underside at some point.

""As far as actually working on the ship goes, I've learned so much,"" he says. ""There's nothing I don't know how to fix. But it all takes a bunch of money to get there.""

Aside from a few small donations, Willson has funded the bulk of the renovation work himself so far.

He's been able to raise finances for the work by buying items from flea markets and state auctions and reselling them on online auctions sites like eBay, as well as working as a consultant on other historic vessel projects.

But while this income has kept the project going so far, it's certainly not enough to fund the full restoration, and Willson is determined to finish what he started.

After coming across YouTube channel Ship Happens , which details the efforts of a UK couple who are renovating an 80-year-old former World War II ship they bought from eBay, Willson was inspired to take his own story to the platform with the aim of raising interest, as well as funding.

He launched the Aurora Restoration Project, in February and the channel has gained nearly 70,000 subscribers.

""Since the whole YouTube thing came about, we have had hundreds and hundreds of people offering to volunteer,"" he says.

Willson is hopeful that its success will help to speed things up, and says he's already seeing results.

""Things are picking up very fast,"" he says.

However, producing videos alongside renovating a ship is proving to be tricky, and he's still ""finding his feet,"" when it comes to juggling both.

""Once I start getting more comfortable with that, we'll hopefully start having groups of volunteers coming in several days a week,"" Willson adds.

Completion in sight?

Although there's still quite a way to go, Willson is slowly moving closer to his goal of transforming the Aurora into a museum.

While he's also thought of transforming the ship into a bed and breakfast, or even a wedding venue, he feels that a museum is the most ""realistic"" option.

""This is something that we're trying to give back to the people,"" he says. ""We don't want to fix it up and make our own private yacht out of the thing.""

And there's certainly a lot to view on board the Aurora. The ship contains 85 cabins, as well as an upper lounge with its own private large forward deck, a swimming pool, a large galley and a theater.

""We have restored a small number of cabins aboard but have many, many to go and will soon offer the opportunity for the public to sponsor the restoration of a cabin,"" he says.

Willson and his team of volunteers are currently working on the fantail, or rear, of the Aurora and aim to fully restore the galley and dining area throughout the rest of 2022.

In recent years, Willson has received furniture from other historic ships to use on board the Aurora.

""We had a large donation from the Island Princess, one of the ships they actually filmed the 'The Love Boat' on, which was just recently scrapped,"" he says.

For the time being, Willson is enjoying working and living on board the ship and looks forward to the day that he'll be able to open it up to the public.

""There's really nothing more spectacular than being able to work on and live on something this unique,"" he adds.

But does he hold out any hope that this spectacular vessel may set sail again one day?",https://cnn.com/travel/article/the-man-who-bought-a-cruise-ship-on-craigslist/index.html
236,10 of Europe's most beautiful train journeys,"(CNN) — It's where the ""flight shame"" movement was born and no wonder -- Europe is home to a superb rail network, including some truly spectacular journeys which are a vacation in themselves. Here are 10 of the most beautiful rides.

Derry-Coleraine railway, Northern Ireland

Tucked away on the Causeway Coast lies seven miles of golden sand, unbroken by rocks. On a clear day, when the sea is so calm that it looks like stone, you can see across to the Scottish Isle of Islay. This is the perfect beach for quiet reflection.

Travel maven Michael Palin called this ""one of the most beautiful railway journeys in the world"" -- what more do you need to know? The 38-minute journey follows the Foyle river out of Derry, weaving through the countryside until it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Benone Strand, one of CNN Travel's best loved beaches . The tracks run right beside the sand here, although you can get off just afterward at Castlerock if you can't resist a walk on the beach.

From there, the train turns inland again, following the river Bann this time, to Coleraine. You'll be following in some important footsteps -- the earliest human settlement on the entire island of Ireland is Mountsandel Fort, high up on the Bann's high bank. It was inhabited from 7600-7900 BCE.

Florence to Naples, Italy

Only in Italy can one of the country's main routes be so beautiful. Italy's main north-south line runs from Milan to Naples and while the top part is take it or leave it, through the flat plains of the Po Valley and then through mountain tunnels from Bologna to Florence, continuing south, you'll roll through some of Italy's most classic landscapes.

Pulling out of Santa Maria Novella station in Florence, you'll glimpse the famous Duomo, then cross the Arno, before chugging through Tuscany, rolling hills on either side, then Umbria and Lazio.

Sit on the left for views of the ragged Apennine mountains; pick the right, and you'll see Orvieto, one of central Italy's most beautiful ancient towns, first sculpted from a tuff rock bluff by the Etruscan civilization. Coming into Rome, you'll roll past the ancient city walls. Got more time? Stay on after Rome to Naples for spectacular views of Vesuvius as you wind into the city.

Barcelona to Montserrat, Spain

Barcelona's grand Plaça d'Espanya is the departure point for the fearsomely beautiful journey to Montserrat, the saw-toothed mountain range rearing up in the distance behind the seaside city, and home to a Benedictine abbey since the 11th century (although the current building is from the 1800s). The 23-mile railway line rumbles through the Catalan countryside to the foot of the mountains, where the Cremallera rack railway has been heaving visitors up the mountainside since 1892 (with a break from 1957-2003).

It's a truly astonishing ride, climbing 1,800 feet in the first 2.5 miles, helped by rack traction. Once you're at the level of the monastery, you can take a further funicular, the Sant Joan, higher up into the peaks. From there you can hike in the mountains.

Semmering Railway, Austria

Nearly 200 years after it opened in 1854, the Semmering Railway is still one of the most beautiful railways around -- and it even enjoys UNESCO World Heritage status. Even better, you can take this if you're traveling between Vienna and Venice -- making it a suitably stunning way to travel between two of Europe's most beautiful cities.

Running for 25 miles through the Austrian Alps between Gloggnitz and Semmering, the Semmering weaves through the mountains, taking in 16 tunnels, 15 viaducts and over 100 bridges, plus a journey through a mountain pass at nearly 3,000 feet and plenty of thrilling bends.

Built as Europe's first mountain railway, designed to connect Vienna to Trieste (which was at the time the Austro-Hungarian empire's port), it's still one of the greats. If you're taking it as part of a longer journey, you'll recognize the Semmering part not just from the great views, but also the 57 cottages built for railway staff spaced out along the line.

Bohinj Railway, Slovenia

Slovenia is a fascinating place to take a train journey, thanks to its location -- its 800 miles of railway lines are part of wider lines connecting Italy to Hungary, and Austria to both Croatia and Italy. This one is no less epic -- it's part of a line connecting Prague to Trieste, or, in other words, landlocked central Europe to the Adriatic Sea.

One of Slovenia's most historic lines, the Bohinj takes in 28 tunnels (one of them just under 17,500 feet long) and 65 bridges -- including the Solkan Bridge, the world's largest stone railway bridge, straddling the Soča river.

Bergen Railway, Norway

Built in 1909, the Bergen railway connects Norway's capital with its second city. This is no ordinary commuter train, though -- it's a spectacular seven-hour ride across the mountain plateaus of Norway, past lakes, hikable mountains, and a village only accessible via train: Finse, at the highest point of the railway.

At Myrdal, you can connect to the cutesy Flåm Railway, whose hour-long ride hoists you up alongside high cliffs, lush greenery and a spectacular waterfall -- a checklist of classic Norwegian beauty.

Nice to Ventimiglia, France, Monaco, Italy

You're here for the views, of course -- stonking vistas of the sparkling Mediterranean, between some of its most delightful towns. But this 50-minute route is also one for your inner travel buff, since it clocks up no fewer than three countries in under an hour, starting in France, dipping into Monaco, coming back out into France and finishing just across the Italian border.

For most of the trip, starting out from Nice Riquier station, you'll have beautiful views, clonking past Art Deco villas, and alternating between snatches of the Med between the trees, and rattling along entire bays, with towns stacked up the cliffsides. You'll pass through some of the most fabled towns on the Cote d'Azur, like Èze (above) and lemon-filled Menton, as well as getting prime views of Monte-Carlo. You'll know you've hit Italy when the smell of blooming bougainvillea hits the air.

Sarajevo to Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina

The road between Bosnia's whimsical capital and its tourist honeypot, pretty Mostar, is beautiful enough; but the two-hour train journey is another level, threading below green mini mountains and ragged cliffs as it follows the emerald Neretva river. You'll arrive in Mostar -- one of CNN Travel's favorite small towns in Europe -- slightly upriver from the famous bridge, which was built by the Ottomans before being destroyed in 1993 by Croat forces and rebuilt stone for stone in 2004.

West Highland Railway, Scotland

You'll likely recognize the Glenfinnan viaduct, which sprawls 1,250 feet through the Scottish Highlands, trains chugging across the river Finnan at a height of 100 feet -- from ""Harry Potter,"" if nothing else.

No wonder this is one of the world's most spectacular train rides -- the epic views on Scotland's most famous railway line draw you straight into the Highlands without so much as leaving the carriage. Leaving Glasgow, it points straight northwest, finishing at Mallaig, where you can take a ferry to the Isle of Skye.

En route, you'll be whisked through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park (yes, you chug alongside the loch), past Ben Nevis and across Rannoch Moor, where the line is ""floated"" above the peat bogs -- with red deer and stags often your nearest neighbors for miles.

237,Inside Chicago O'Hare Airport's $8.5 billion revamp,"(CNN) — The city of Chicago has long had one of the world's busiest airport systems.

Before the Jet Age and until the late 1950s, Chicago Midway Airport, in the southwest of the city, was the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic.

Its runways, however, were too short for early jet aircraft, and in the span of just a couple of years all flights migrated to O'Hare, in the northwest, which had longer runways and newly built terminals.

The move made O'Hare take over as the world's busiest airport in 1962, a title it held for over 25 years. The high volume of passengers, however, came at a cost: the airport became notoriously congested.

Penalized by the city's unpredictable weather, the runway configuration that attracted jet aircraft didn't stand the test of time.

By the time O'Hare definitively lost the crown of world's busiest airport -- to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson in 1998 -- it was famously overcrowded and losing ground on most performance rankings, often ranking low for customer satisfaction.

The only way forward was a radical modernization of the runway system, which began in 2005 and cost $6 billion. Work was completed in 2021, drastically reducing delays and paving the way for a complete makeover of the rest of the airport -- with an additional $8.5 billion investment -- that will transform it ""from curb to gate,"" the city says (and maybe climb back up those rankings).

Eight runways

Today, O'Hare has eight runways -- six parallel to each other and two that run diagonally. Previously, it had three pairs of parallel runways intersecting each other, a configuration that increased the risk of aircraft collision and was susceptible to disruption from weather conditions.

""We now have the most capable runway network of any civilian airport in the world,"" says Robert Hoxie, chief development officer at the Chicago Department of Aviation. ""We've reduced delays by 65% -- that's tens of thousands of flights that are now operating on time but didn't use to.""

It was a long process, but by 2015 things had improved enough for the attention to move to the terminal buildings. American Airlines and United, which both have hubs at O'Hare, approached the city to discuss major improvements.

""The original passenger terminals were built in the mid-1950s,"" Hoxie says, ""They're now more than 60 years old and they just don't have the amenities that passengers want, nor the efficiencies that airlines need to operate a good connecting hub.""

In 2019, the idea coalesced into O'Hare 21, a radical plan to revamp the airport and make it ready for the 21st century.

The big ticket items are an entire new ""global"" terminal, two new satellite concourses for Terminal 1, and a complete makeover of the existing Terminal 5 -- but the plan includes almost 100 separate projects, many of which are smaller but functional improvements, such as upgrades to parking garages, new water mains and electrical distribution systems, and refurbished underground pedestrian tunnels.

The lion's share of the investments will go into modernizing the terminals, which will transform the passenger experience at O'Hare.

It's a long-term plan -- works won't be completed until 2028 at the earliest -- but just like the runway modernization, it will be delivered progressively, upgrading the airport piece by piece. Some areas of the new Terminal 5, which is being refurbished now, have already opened to the public.

A Chicago symbol

""We're spending more than a billion dollars to revamp Terminal 5, expanding its capacity but also modernizing its systems,"" says Hoxie. The terminal will no longer be focused on international flights but on carriers that are simply moving passengers to and from Chicago, including low-cost carriers like Spirit. Delta will also move here later in the fall.

The upgrades include 10 new gates, a new baggage handling system and new security checkpoints.

Work started in March 2020, when the world was going into lockdown for the coronavirus outbreak: ""The pandemic has been universally unhelpful to our business, but having a less crowded terminal has enabled us to work more efficiently and more quickly than we thought we'd be able to,"" says Hoxie.

An even bigger investment, $2.2 billion, will go into a completely new terminal dedicated to international traffic, which will rise on the soon-to-be-demolished Terminal 2 -- the oldest facility still in use today.

At the moment, O'Hare has a single international terminal that is separate from the domestic one, so passengers on connecting flights have to switch terminals.

""In the new Terminal 2, called O'Hare Global Terminal, passengers will be able to clear US Customs, return to the secure area and be only minutes away from their departing gate -- without needing to ride a train to a different terminal or tow bags across the airfield,"" says Hoxie.

The design of the new building is the result of a competition won by Chicago's Studio ORD, and is inspired by a city icon, the Municipal Device. It's an encircled Y symbol that represents the north and south branches of the Chicago river coming together, and can be found throughout the city on buildings, fences, lamp posts and bridges.

Similarly, the new terminal building will be Y-shaped, with a six-pointed glass skylight positioned at the meeting of the branches. The roof will be clad in wood, with pleats oriented to maximize natural daylight.

What the new Terminal 5 should look like. Chicago Department of Aviation

At 2.2 million square feet, the Global Terminal will be 75% bigger than the existing Terminal 2, and one of the largest in the US. That will make room for a number of amenities including nursing rooms, yoga studios, and a variety of food and beverage options.

It also aims to be more efficient for airlines, thanks to a new baggage handling system that boasts automated storage for 5,000 bags, and more flexible gates -- capable of handling widebody aircraft and then quickly reconfiguring for smaller ones.

Previously, the lack of such flexibility has meant that, over the years, O'Hare's original 189 gates were reduced to 184, as the average wingspan of aircraft increased as a way to save fuel.

At the end of the entire project, gate capacity will increase by 25%, and the overall square footage of passenger terminals will go from about five million square feet today to just under nine million square feet.

Work on the new Global Terminal, as well as the new two satellite concourses, won't start for several years, however: a host of regulatory and environmental assessments must be cleared first, and then replacement aircraft gates must be built before the ones currently in use at Terminal 2 can be decommissioned and demolished.

In the meantime, work will continue on the refurbishment of Terminal 5, which will be completed in late 2023.",http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chicago-o-hare-airport-makeover/index.html
238,"Why this Chinese tea costs more than $184,000 per kilogram","Hong Kong (CNN) — A sumptuous three-course afternoon tea at Glassbelly Tea Lab , a fine-dining restaurant in Hong Kong, has just begun.

But neither the abalone nor the A4 Wagyu ribeye are the stars of the show.

It's the eight glasses of tea that lure patrons to this dark, wood-paneled space in the city's busy Causeway Bay neighborhood.

On the left, three shot glasses contain three different varieties of hot tea: plum-scented raw Puerh tea, Gold Needle Dian Hong (a relatively new black tea from Yunnan) and a peat-scented Rougui -- a type of oolong rock tea from the Wuyi Mountains in China's Fujian Province.

On the right, we have ice drip Full Blossom Rougui tea, served in five Riedel glasses.

""Please have a sniff,"" says the server. ""With the cognac glass, you can get more of the fruit smell. With the Burgundy glass, you pick up more floral flavors.""

It's an unusual and modern way of sampling tea. But I'm here on a mission -- to find out why just a few handfuls of some types of Chinese tea leaves cost thousands of dollars.

Glassbelly specializes in oolong rock tea from Wuyi, which is one of the priciest tea varieties on the planet. It's a specific kind of oolong tea that grows on rocks on eastern China's Wuyi Mountains -- hence the name, ""rock tea.""

Famous rock tea varieties from this area include Rougui, Da Hong Pao and Shui Xian -- which translates to Cinnamon, Big Red Robe and Narcissus, respectively.

Glassbelly's most prized item is the Niu Lan Keng Rougui, a rare variety of Rougui tea from a valley brook of the same name in the Wuyi Mountains.

The retail price? HKD36,000 ($4,560) for 25 grams, or $184,615 for a kilogram, at the time of writing. Enjoying one brew of the tea at the restaurant costs HKD28,000 ($3,577).

To put this into context, a small 150-200 ml pot of tea is usually made with about five grams of tea leaves.

Tea auctions

Rare teas have long been commanding sky-high prices in China. This isn't a new trend.

In 2002, 20 grams of Da Hong Pao -- also a Wuyi Mountain tea, once reserved for the emperor's lips only -- was auctioned for RMB180,000 ($28,000) in Guangzhou.

In 2009, a 100-gram Taiping Houkui (green tea from Anhui) was auctioned for RMB200,000 ($31,300) in Jinan.

More recently, in December 2021, Sotheby's Hong Kong launched its first-ever tea auction, focusing on vintage Puerh tea. A 330-gram tea cake (compressed tea leaves in a cake form) sold for HKD562,500 ($72,150).

Initially, I set out solely to find out why these teas continue to come with such high price tags. But during my research I discovered just how wonderful, secretive and complex the Chinese tea world really is -- and met some new players on the scene who are making bold moves to shake things up.

Making sense of Chinese tea

First, let's start with the basics. There are six main types of Chinese tea: green, white, yellow, oolong, black tea and dark tea.

Each of them is categorized by how the leaves are processed and how long they are fermented. (Green tea is unfermented while dark tea is double fermented.)

Under each category, there are different varieties of teas named for a number of reasons. It could be the location it was harvested. Puerh tea, for example, can only come from certain places in Yunnan.

The leaves are important as well. Lapsang Souchong uses the entire tea leaf while Jin Jun Mei uses only the buds of the leaves.

Glassbelly says that boiling water in a silver pot helps ionize it, making the tea silkier. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

""To understand why some teas are expensive, first, you have to understand what a good tea is,"" explains Wing Yeung, founder of Glassbelly.

This a surprisingly challenging question to answer in spite of the fact tea is one of the most popular beverages in the world.

""A major problem with Chinese tea is that there is no subjective answer to what good tea is. There are many sentimental stories and artistic elements when it comes to selling tea, but so little about the actual flavors of the tea,"" says Yeung, who has worked in the wine industry as well, specializing in Burgundy.

""If you look at wine and coffee, both are plant-derived beverages that have been doing so much better than Chinese tea in the commercial market.""

Lack of a widely recognized system

The lack of a well-recognized standardization system contributes to the pricing confusion.

Compared to wine or coffee, the market is less transparent, making it harder for consumers to know how much a particular type of tea should cost and why.

Yeung claims that her team has poured HKD40 million (around $5 million) worth of tea in pursuit of finding an answer to that question in the last decade, leading them to open Glassbelly in 2021.

The name Glassbelly was inspired by an ancient Chinese semi-mythological character, Shennong (the Divine Farmer).

According to legend, Shennong had a translucent belly. To help the world test the usage and toxicity of vegetation, Shennong would sample every herb he came across and record how it changed in his body, including tea.

Yeung hopes that her Glassbelly restaurant will help shine some clarity on the market, thanks to its modern and scientific approach to tea.

""The tea industry may have changed but the selling technique was stuck like it was 1,000 years ago. There were a lot of hushed business talks and secret deals,"" says Yeung.

Her comments ring true. Several years ago, I took a taxi ride in the city of Wuyi at night. The driver, knowing I was a tourist, slowed down his car to around 20 kilometers per hour, giving him more time to attempt to convince me he had some secret connections who would help me score some Da Hong Pao tea at a good price.

He was just one of several people who tried to sell me tea on that trip.

""Everyone in Wuyi would try to sell you the 'authentic Da Hong Pao' but there are only six mother Da Hong Pao trees -- and they aren't for sale. Authentic Da Hong Pao bred solely from the original trees is also very limited. So it's very hard to find out whether a tea is what the seller claims it is,"" says Yeung.

""We've had sums of money spent on exclusive 'high-end' tea leaves that turned out to be horrible. We learned along the way.""

The flavor wheel

Glassbelly's flavor wheel. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

After a decade of traveling between Hong Kong and mainland China -- mostly to Wuyi Mountain -- Yeung has accumulated thousands of tasting notes to develop Glassbelly's version of a flavor wheel for Chinese tea.

""Wuyi tea is the Burgundy of tea, with so much complexity. It is what the industry calls a 'raw tea' (not fully fermented) so it keeps changing in your glass as well as in your mouth,"" says Yeung.

Rock teas contain over a dozen types of flavor profiles but there are a few your taste buds should be looking for -- citrus, sandalwood and cinnamon.

One Glassbelly workshop invites patrons to compare raw and aged Puerh tea, which is highly prized among tea connoisseurs.

""Raw Puerh tea smells like plum. Aged Puerh tea often comes with the smell of camphor mothballs and old newspaper, which some would say is normal. But if you sample it objectively by taste, your body will naturally repel these smells. I think it is a good sign that it isn't a good tea, like what marketers have been claiming,"" says Yeung.

""It's the smell of a Puerh tea aged in an unnatural way -- by adding humidity to speed up its aging process. It is an accepted practice in the industry but doesn't mean it is good.""

A post on the restaurant's Instagram page says drinking aged Puerh is a "" slow suicide .""

This contrasts the many long-held beliefs in the market that aged Puerh is mild on one's body, while raw Puerh is shunned as too ""cold"" and harmful to one's stomach, according to traditional Chinese medicinal wisdom.

The untold truth

Puerh tea is another highly prized Chinese tea in the market. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

Glassbelly's contrarian views have raised a few eyebrows in the industry.

But, Yeung says, ""truth is always controversial. Controversy makes people reflect and think. Cultural progress usually comes after controversy.""

Wanting to dig more into Glassbelly's claims, I approached respected Puerh tea collector, Raymond Ray.

""I totally admire their outspokenness. So gutsy,"" gasps Ray. ""They actually said something not many in the industry are willing to say.

""But I'd say, good raw Puerh tastes like more than just plum. And not all aged Puerh is bad -- only those that aren't aged in a natural way, which is quite common."".

The story behind Ray's rise in the Hong Kong tea industry has made him a bit of a legend. About a decade ago, he fell sick from a spine disease, leaving him temporarily immobile.

A long-time wine lover, Raymond remembers taking his first sip of a good rock tea.

""It was like my tongue was coming back to life again. I now had something to live for,"" recalls Ray. With a sore back and weak legs, he traveled around Yunnan in search of the best Puerh tea.

""Some historians have confirmed that Yunnan is the origin of tea,"" says Ray. ""I would sit in a car for a four-hour rugged journey to the mountains, then walked with a cane with my bad back.""

That's where he got acquainted with the area's many small Puerh farms.

""You know, really good tea comes from old trees. When it can grow organically with roots big and strong enough that they don't need any chemicals and fertilizers. Farmers will have to climb up the tree to handpick these leaves,"" says Ray.

Raymond Ray, founder of Yuencha Land, says that drinking Puerh tea has restored his once-frail health. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

Today, Ray stands tall and walks without any aid. He founded Yuencha Land , an appointment-only tea studio in Hong Kong that serves mostly organically grown raw Puerh sourced from mountain trees that are more than 400 years old.

""I think everyone should find a tea that's good for their bodies. Puerh is what works for me,"" says Ray, who credits the drink with restoring his health.

Marketing, rarity and tastes

Much of the problem with artificially aged Puerh dates back to the post-WWII period.

Once a tea served to emperors, Puerh lost its luster over time. It was even dubbed ""coolie tea"" in the Canton area, suggesting it was a drink reserved for low-income workers.

Rather than aging it and letting it ferment naturally, sellers relied on the humidity in the Canton area to accelerate the process, which intensified the flavors. New techniques were developed to add extra moisture to the leaves and developing cultures to further speed things up.

The resulting musty, camphor smell became the signature of aged Puerh.

Today, there are different schools of thought attached to Puerh tea and its often high price tags, like with other Chinese teas.

""It is hard to untangle the history behind it,"" says Ray. ""Marketing definitely plays an important role in many of these record-breaking prices.""

Rarity is another factor, not just for Puerh tea but all varieties.

Some of the tea is so rare that there is no price tag -- the leaves are not for sale. For example, the original Da Hong Pao trees are state-protected. meaning they aren't harvested for commercial purposes.

""There is also a price for commercial tea and another price for artisanal tea. It's like the difference between house wine and collectors' wines,"" says Yeung.

What makes a tea good?

For customers sampling these high-end brews, Yeung has an important reminder.

""Have a piece of food, or you will get tea drunk,"" she says.

Tea has a similar effect as alcohol, but with arguably fewer side effects. Consuming too much tea can make one relax and feel light-headed: tea drunk.

""Tea helps expand your palette during a meal. So I'd argue it is a more suitable drink to pair with food than coffee and wine. Your tongue will be more sensitive as you drink tea,"" says Yeung.

According to both Ray and Yeung, the senses will play an increasingly important role in the future of tea as more people disregard the classic tales and marketing techniques, purely wanting to pursue the all-important question -- how should a good tea taste?

""I'd look into these six categories: color, fragrance, taste, aftertaste, chi and nature,"" says Ray.

""The latter two are more abstract. Chi is the liveliness and complexity of a tea -- how it will change in your mouth, whereas nature is how the tea reacts with your body,"" says Ray.

Yeung doesn't give me an answer right away. Instead, she goes into the kitchen and returns with a server and a pot of tea leaves.

Water boils in a vintage silver pot -- which is said to boost the ion in the water and make the water's texture silkier.

The tea is brewed in a violet clay pot that helps keep the leaves warm. Once the temperature drops, the leaves will contract and release fewer flavors.

The brewing is quick. The tea, a clear red hue, is poured out almost as soon as the pot is filled.

""Drink it. This is the Niu Lan Keng Rougui,"" says Yeung. She gathers the team around to have a sip of the next brews. (A batch of good tea leaves can be brewed up to 10 times on average.)

""We don't brew a Niu Lan Keng Rougui every day so everyone is excited,"" she says with a smile, pouring about HKD28,000 (or $3,577) worth of tea into everyone's mini tea cups.

The first sip numbs the tongue. Then the flavors of the citrus and the wood we sampled earlier come in slowly but in a much more condensed and gentle form.

""It should be clear, fragrant, 'gan,' harmonious and alive -- it changes on your tongue,"" says Yeung.

Gan, often translated as sweet, is a Chinese word that describes a specific kind of sweetness and freshness that's accompanied by a hint of bitterness.

239,The travelers who created their own cozy campervans,"(CNN) — Search the #vanlife hashtag on Instagram and you'll find millions of posts from travelers on the road in tiny homes on wheels.

While some van lifers will have opted to buy readymade campervans, more and more are choosing to buy a van or bus and convert it themselves.

Of course, this is hardly a new phenomenon. Campervan conversions have been around since at least the 1950s.

However, their popularity has skyrocketed in recent years. Demand had already increasing significantly before the pandemic, partly due to the numerous YouTube channels and Instagram posts devoted to DIY van conversions.

But interest went through the roof as many people found themselves stuck at home with little to do as borders shut down and restrictions were put in place in many destinations around the world.

""People wanted to get out. They wanted to get away from other people and stay safe, and we were all limited in what we could do,"" Brian Jagodnik, marketing and creative director at Outside Van, a luxury van conversion company in Portland, Oregon, told CNN Business last year.

""It pushed people outside and to travel away from others and take the road less traveled, and so the industry just continued to grow.""

As a result, the #vanlife community is expanding further, with an increasing amount of travelers, many of whom may have already been mulling over whether or not to get a van, making the decision to buy one, and in some cases, do it up themselves.

So how difficult is a DIY campervan conversion? And are video tutorials and social media posts really enough to get you through a van build? Here, we talk to a number of travelers who've taken the plunge themselves.

""It's functional and not too fancy""

Dale Comley and Charlie Low spent over a year converting their van into a campervan. Climbingvan

Dale Comley and Charlie Low, both from the UK, purchased a yellow Mercedes Sprinter for £8,000 (around $10,500) in 2019 and spent roughly £6,500 ($8,500) converting it into a campervan. The couple now live in their van Ringo full time and have written a book about van conversions together.

Investing in a van was a no-brainer for Comley and Low who met on a climbing trip and have been together for almost six years.

""It's something that we both always wanted to do since we met,"" Low tells CNN Travel.

""We're both from a climbing background, and climbing and van life are fairly synonymous. If you go to any climbing areas, you'll see lots of vans. We decided to take the plunge in June 2019.""

Like many other travelers, they chose to buy a van and convert it themselves rather than splashing out on a readymade motorhome. That way they could create something that was tailored to their needs and tastes.

""The great opportunity with converting your own van is that you don't need to fall into the trap of essentially buying a motorhome and being stuck with one layout,"" says Comley. ""You can truly create whatever you want.""

Once they'd purchased the van, the couple parked it at Low's mother's house, where they had more space to work, and took time out to plan the design and layout.

""I'd say the most common mistake that people make is, if anything, is spending more time converting the van than actually using it,"" says Comley. Climbingvan

""We're both fairly practical,"" says Comley. ""So we spent a long time designing so that we essentially got it right the first time.""

They completed a lot of research on YouTube, but say they found that everyone had different ideas about the best way of doing things.

""There wasn't really a definitive single source of information,"" says Comley. ""There were hundreds or thousands of opinions that weren't really founded in any sort of fact. It was all personal experience.""

They began by gutting the van, before fitting in windows, as well as skylights and solar panels. The next step was insulating the van, before installing the electrical system and cladding.

They then built their bed, their kitchen, with a Belfast sink, overhead cabinets and other necessary structures, before installing the water and gas systems.

Once all of that was done, they were able to begin decorating their mobile home, which meant painting the walls, putting tiles in the kitchen area and upholstering the seats.

Although they had a few false starts, where they followed someone else's method and found there was ""something fundamentally wrong with what we'd been told to do,"" the pair, who documented the entire process on their Instagram account , say the build went smoothly overall.

""Provided you've got a bit of a process to follow, and you spend some time designing it, there's not really any single job that is very difficult,"" says Comley.

""All of the practical stuff is quite quick and simple. You don't really need any specialist tools and you don't really need any experience.""

If in doubt, travelers have the option to hire professionals to help with parts of the build they're less confident about.

""It's very possible to just outsource one part of your van build,"" adds Low.

The couple say it took just over a year, or the equivalent of around 1,000 hours between them, to complete the van.

""It [the van] is a nice standard. It's functional and not too fancy, which is basically us. So it would be quite easy to spend significantly more [or less] if you wanted to,"" says Comley.

""Our original plan was that once we'd finished the van, we'd go traveling for a year,"" says Low.

""But what happened in reality was that we finished the van, and then a week later, the UK went into lockdown. So it was fairly appalling timing.""

It was at this point that they decided to write a book, "" The Van Conversion Bible ,"" with the aim of preventing others from making some of the same mistakes they did.

""You can kind of fall from one hole into another, into another, into another,"" explains Comley. ""Some cost you financially, and some cost you time.

""So that's really why we wrote the book. To try to help people avoid as many of those holes as possible.""

The couple, who also have a van conversion blog, were finally able to go on the road when travel restrictions eased around the world, and have since traveled to France, Switzerland, Spain, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Croatia.

The couple are now enjoying life on the road, and say they wouldn't change a thing about their van, Ringo. Climbingvan

""It [the van] is going to allow us to explore countries that realistically, we probably would never have gotten to,"" says Comley.

They've been living in their van Ringo for around a year now, and believe that anyone can convert a van, provided they stay focused and think of the project in stages

""When you think about converting a van, it feels quite scary, potentially, and not possible,"" says Low.

""But if you break it down into all of the different things you need to do, and then you kind of learn about each individual thing, it makes it feel a lot more manageable.

Comley also recommends that travelers try going on at least one van trip before even thinking about spending time and money on a conversion.

""Make sure you actually like it,"" he says. ""Irrespective of how good it [the van] is, you're going to spend a lot of time and probably money working on it.

""I'd say the most common mistake that people make is, if anything, is spending more time converting the van than actually using it.""

'I did all of it myself'

Jennifer Mckechnie from Northern Ireland bought a minibus for £2,300 (nearly $3,000) in 2019 and spent around £3,500 (around $4,564) converting it into the campervan of her dreams. The former fitness instructor has since set up her own campervan conversion business and completed six conversions last year.

""I used to go snowboarding every year to Chamonix,"" Mckechnie tells CNN Travel. ""And I remember being in a bar once and I saw a video of a guy who had a van. He was traveling around snowboarding. I thought, 'Oh, I'd love to do that.' ""

One of the biggest attractions of van life for Mckechnie was that she'd be able to travel around with her two huskies in tow.

""I love traveling to different countries and going snowboarding, but I've always wanted to take my dogs with me. So it [getting the van] was purely so that I could drive to Chamonix and bring them along.""

After spending a bit of time watching YouTube videos and reading articles on how to convert a van, she purchased one in 2019.

While Mckechnie had planned to work on the van on weekends mainly, she found herself with a great deal of time on her hands when the pandemic set in and she was unable to work.

""Everything else in the world was closed,"" she explains. ""So I didn't have anything else to do.""

She began by stripping out all of the seats in the van -- there were 17 in total -- before removing the walls and floor.

""I basically stripped it back to a bare metal shell, and then started from there,"" says Mckechnie.

The next step was covering corrosion on the floor with rust converter, then filling in gaps in the walls, floor and ceiling and insulating the van.

After installing the walls, the ceiling and the electrics, Mckechnie took some time out to design the layout of the van.

""The biggest problem was that builders merchants and things like that were closed,"" she says. ""So it was hard to get materials.""

Mckechnie was able to complete all of the labor herself and says she spent a total of 100 days on the build.

""I had my dad help me put the ceiling up, as it takes two sets of hands to do that,"" she explains. ""But I did all of it myself.""

A friend persuaded her to share a video of her renovation work on TikTok, and Mckechnie was soon inundated with messages from travelers asking her to build them a van.

""Everyone was saying, 'I want one. Can you build me one?'"" she says. The post went on to receive around 14 million views.

Once she'd mulled things over, Mckechnie eventually said ""yes"" to one of the van build requests.

""I decided that I'd give it a go,"" she says. ""And if it didn't work, I'd just go back to doing what I was doing.""

However, Mckechnie went on to receive so many bookings that she decided to quit her day job and set up a bespoke van company. She now spends her days building custom campervans for other travelers and says business is booming.

""This was never the plan,"" she says. ""But here we are.""

Once her own van was complete, Mckechnie went on her first road trip with her dogs and says everything went smoothly.

""I did have a couple of people ask 'what happens if you hit a speed bump? Does it all fall off?' she says. ""But it actually went really well and the dogs enjoyed it. The only thing that probably moved would be the cushions.""

Ironically, the success of her company, Custom Conversions NI , has meant that she hasn't been able to travel in her van much over the last few years.

""The last time that I used my van was August of 2020,"" she admits. ""I'm fully booked for the next 12 months. It's madness.""

However, there's nothing she enjoys more than sending travelers off in a campervan that's been customized just for them.

""They tell me what they want and I build it that way, as opposed to them buying a motorhome or a van that's already been converted and may have things in it that they just don't need,"" she explains.

According to Mckechnie, the most unusual request she's had so far is a sliding wardrobe.

""I did manage to put that in there,"" she says. ""But I think sometimes people forget that we are in a little square box, so you have to think about the necessities.""

Although each traveler will have different ideas on what they consider essential, for Mckechnie the basics tend to be ""a bed, a kitchen, somewhere to charge your phone, a couple of lights, and if you have the space, a portable toilet.""

Mckechnie occasionally helps her customers find a van before beginning a conversion and has noticed that prices have shot up in the three years since she converted her own van.

""They're like gold dust at the moment,"" she says. ""Everyone knows how popular it [van life] is.""

'Our partition wall is quite controversial'

Claire Falconer and Luke Morris spent around four months working on the build for their campervan conversion. Luke Morris and Claire Falconer

In January 2020, Claire Falconer and husband Luke Morris left Dubai and relocated Down Under, where they bought a Mercedes Sprinter for 32,000 Australia dollars (around $23,740) and spent roughly $13,470 converting it into a fabulous home on wheels.

They were both living in Dubai when they first got together, but after several years in the emirate, Falconer and Morris decided to pack up and move to Falconer's native Australia.

""Luke and I have always loved traveling, it's in our blood,"" Falconer tells CNN Travel via email. ""We have seen a lot of the world and it was always my dream to return to Australia one day and finally travel my home country.""

Once they began investigating the different ways they could travel Australia, they decided to go down the van route.

""I didn't really know about the whole van life movement in much detail until I started looking into it, and realized how big and how amazing some of the vans are,"" says Morris. ""I really had no idea what I was getting myself into.""

They say they opted to go with a van instead of a caravan, ""just for the flexibility of being able to park up at the beach and things like that,"" and were keen for something with a high roof so that Morris, who is six foot two inches tall, would be able to stand in it.

The couple purchased a Mercedes Sprinter just a week after arriving in Melbourne, and got started on the build pretty much immediately.

They were working out the layout and some of the finer details when the pandemic hit, and Melbourne went into lockdown in March 2020.

Thankfully one of the few shops that remained open in the city was a hardware store, so they were able to get hold of many of the materials they needed and ""just cracked on with the build for the whole of the lockdown.""

Before the conversion, Falconer and Morris say they'd done very little DIY work other than putting furniture together. However, they threw themselves into the build completely, sharing their experiences on their Instagram account

""It was honestly great; we work super well together as a team,"" says Falconer, who works as a health coach and a yoga teacher. ""Obviously building the van had its tough moments, but for the most part we loved doing it.""

Falconer had been following various van life accounts on social media for a while and says she'd picked up lots of design inspiration.

""When it came to color schemes, she wanted it all white, beachy and quite premium,"" says Morris, who own and runs eco-friendly accessories company Wild Wood.

After a bit of deliberation, they chose to put in a partition wall between the cab and the living space rather than keep the space open.

""That [the partition wall] is quite controversial in the van life world,"" says Morris. ""I guess it's because people generally want access from the cab to the living space, but we didn't see the need for that.""

Although much of the build process went to plan, they found themselves in a sticky situation when they settled on putting up real tiles in the kitchen area and used the wrong type of adhesive, which meant they had to rip them out and start again.

""That was a bit of a nightmare for a couple of days, just because it was so time consuming,"" says Morris.

While Morris was initially determined to complete all of the work himself, he eventually chose to outsource the electrics and the plumbing work to experts so that he could focus on the parts of the build that he felt more comfortable with.

""You need to get an electrical certificate, and a plumbing certificate to actually sign it off as a motor home anyway,"" he adds.

If they happened to be struggling with any part of the build, Falconer and Morris say they would reach out to others for advice.

""People in the van life community are extremely helpful with that kind of thing, they are willing to give you advice and actually help you out,"" says Morris.

The couple say it took around four months to complete the van, with their total spend came to 52,207 Australian dollars (about $38,732) including registration, stamp duty and insurance costs, which was more or less what they'd estimated before beginning.

""Some of the things were a little more expensive [than we thought],"" says Morris. ""But nothing too crazy.""

Falconer and Morris welcomed their son Beau in April 2021 and admit that living in a campervan with a baby has proved to be extremely challenging.

""Our lil' man doesn't stop,"" says Falconer. ""He's so, so active, so we have struggled with that a bit on the road, as its hard to always keep him out of trouble.

""We can't just leave him to play like we would in a house. One of us constantly needs to be on him. But we absolutely love traveling with him and having him by our side at every moment.

""There is something so special about seeing the world through his eyes.""

Due to the regional Covid-19 border restrictions in Australia, they haven't been able to explore as much of the country as they'd have liked, or see many of their family and friends for the past two years.

They're due to visit Asia to see family and friends the coming weeks, but will be taking off in the van again once they return to Australia in a few months time.

""It will be winter here, so we'll be driving north pretty quickly to get into some warmer weather,"" says Morris. ""Then we can finish off doing everything that we missed while borders have been closed. That will be really exciting.""

'My heart and soul went into it'

Cori Geiger bought a used Ford Transit in 2020 for $36,000 and spent around $19,000 converting it into a campervan that she could live and work in remotely while traveling around the country. She is now based in her van, named Cadia, full time.

Geiger, from Massachusetts, had often dreamed about going on the road in a campervan, but it wasn't until the pandemic set in and her job as a senior project manager went fully remote, that she felt ready to give van life a try.

""I really didn't want to be paying rent in a city,"" Geiger tells CNN Travel. ""I wasn't going to be commuting into an office anymore, and I wasn't ready to buy a house -- prices are crazy in the US right now. So this made the most sense for my life.

""I could work remotely and travel around and see the country at the same time.""

According to Geiger, one of the main reasons she decided to convert the van herself was because pre-built van conversions were significantly more expensive.

""They can be over $100,000,"" she says. ""So I didn't want to go that route, and I wanted the challenge of building it myself. That way I could actually control how much I was spending during the build.""

Geiger had already been watching online videos about van life and tiny homes for a couple years before deciding to build her van, so she had an idea of the type of layouts she liked, as well as how much work she'd need to do.

Once she'd purchased the van, Geiger began the conversion, working her way through the project step by step.

""It starts with building the insulation and prepping the van for everything that you're going to be putting on to it,"" she explains

""That means putting down the floor and the framing that you're going to be drilling the walls into and putting things on the outside.""

Although she had little experience with renovation work before starting the build, Geiger found that she picked things up relatively quickly for the most part.

""My skills were very basic,"" she admits. ""So learning how to use power tools and measuring stuff, that was definitely a learning curve. But it was really fun working through it all.""

Aside from calling on her family to help with tasks that required ""multiple hands,"" Geiger was able to complete the build on her own.

""It was really important to me that my van felt like an apartment or a cozy home,"" she adds. ""The layout was also really important, I had a really big dog at the time -- I now have two dogs.

""So I wanted an open layout where she would be comfortable while I was working full and I wanted an open space.""

Aside from calling on her family when she needed extra hands, Geiger completed the whole conversion herself. Cori Geiger

Geiger was able to achieve this by building a Murphy bed design, which folds out of a wall or cabinet, into the van.

""That really changed the game for me,"" she says. ""It goes down while I'm sleeping, but then it goes back up against the wall, which means I have a lot more space. I have a full living room area.""

Geiger also has a full sink with a large faucet, which she uses as an outdoor shower. She says she spent $3,192 on the exterior accessories, including a ladder, roof racks, and a security system, and an extra $4,236 on building supplies, along with tools, wood and other materials.

The electrical system set her back around $5,667, which included power sockets and wiring, and the plumbing costs worked out to $1,253. Finally, the cost of interior accessories, paint and other design elements came to $5,528.

""I love showing people my van, because my heart and soul went into it,"" she says.

Geiger says she bought the van for $36,000 and spent around $19,000 converting it into a tiny home. Cori Geiger

Geiger set off on the road back in September 2021 and says she hasn't looked back. While she admits that a few issues have cropped up with the van along the way, such as her water pumps freezing up, she's been able to deal with them thanks to the skills she learned during the build.

""Just living van life, there's so many problems that you have to solve every day,"" she says. ""But you get used to it because you built the van, and you had to problem solve through the build.""

Geiger has found being part of van life truly life changing and urges others who are keen to try it out not to wait too long.

""Don't wait for retirement,"" she says. ""I talk to so many people on the road. And the number one thing they say to me is, ""it's awesome that you're doing it so young, I wish I had done it earlier in my life.'

""So if it's something you want to do, you should do it. There will always be hard days and tough days, but you will be so much stronger, happier, fulfilled and proud of yourself after you finish a project like this.""

'Gem's the interior designer, I'm the laborer'

Matthew Dacombe and Gemma Hitchcock show off their van, the Happy Hoppa. Matt & Gem

Matthew Dacombe and Gemma Hitchcock bought a green wheelchair accessible minibus for £4,500 (around $5,868) in 2020. It took them around eight months to convert it into a campervan, at a cost of around £5,500 ($7,170). The couple, who are both teachers, got engaged during their first trip and plan to incorporate their van, the Happy Hoppa, into their wedding.

When their plans to travel around Europe by train fell through due to the pandemic, Dacombe and Hitchcock began searching for alternative ways to see the world together once borders reopened.

While they'd previously discussed the possibility of getting a campervan, they say it was witnessing another couple relaxing in a converted van during a trip to the beach that helped them finally make the decision.

As the UK went into a second lockdown in 2020, Dacombe and Hitchcock drew up a plan for the layout of their dream van on the back of a brown envelope and began the project.

""We've still got the envelope now,"" says Hitchcock.

They originally setting themselves a budget of £8,000 (around $10,430) but realized they were likely to go over when they began looking into vans, and found a minibus for about $5,868 that they couldn't resist.

""I remember just staring at the back of this bus, thinking 'oh gosh. What have we done?"" admits Hitchcock.

Dacombe and Hitchcock worked tirelessly on the bus in order to get it into shape. Matt & Gem

The couple say they didn't really plan out the build in much detail before beginning, but would take on something new week by week and reach out to other van lifers for advice.

Determined to keep costs down, they completed the entire renovation using just a jigsaw, a drill, a hand saw, a spirit measure, a screwdriver, a sander and a workbench.

""We tried to go as minimal as possible,"" says Dacombe. ""We pretty much built the whole van on just wooden battens and plywood. Even the doors of the cabinets and all our drawers.

""They all came from plywood. We kept it cheap, but we've got good quality products.""

Not only has this method saved them money, it's also helped to keep the weight of the van down.

The maximum weight restrictions for motorhomes and campervans within the UK and Europe tends to be 3.5 tons. If a vehicle is over the legal weight limit, owners are required to upgrade their driving license or they could face fines.

While Dacombe and Hitchcock did the majority of the work themselves, the couple used a specialist company for their electrical system.

""Going into it, I was quite confident with the appearance of converting a van,"" says Dacombe. ""But electricity was another ballgame. You don't want to get that wrong.""

They also brought in professionals to help remove some metal flooring that had been glued to the floor of the van.

In order to keep costs down, they built most of the inside furniture and compartments from plywood. Matt & Gem

Once they'd cladded the walls and the ceiling of the van, built a bed frame and cut their mattress to size, the next big task was building an L-shaped kitchen with a sink in the remaining space, and constructing their sofa areas.

""That's when it got really exciting,"" says Hitchcock. ""Because we could actually see what we'd planned on the brown envelope.""

The conversion took eight months in total. Hitchcock says she was very particular about how she wanted the van to look and would come up with new ideas at the last minute.

""I wanted it to be very beachy, very wooden and fresh,"" she says. ""We really wanted to maximize all of the windows on the bus.""

A few days before they were due to leave on their first trip in the van, Hitchcock decided they needed a wine rack for their fridge.

While this proved to be a tricky task, Dacombe created one that could fit inside by cutting a double wine rack in half, and both say it has come in extremely handy.

""Gemma's the interior designer and I'm the laborer,"" he admits. ""But I don't think we'd have been able to do it without both of us chipping in on both sides.""

Dacombe bought an engagement ring shortly before they set off, and was waiting for the right moment to propose.

He ended up popping the question on the beach later that same evening after they'd parked up at Durdle Door in Dorset, a coastal beauty spot in southwest England, and were watching the sunset together.

""I had the ring, I had asked Gem's mum and dad for permission and I knew I would be doing it during our travels,"" says Dacombe.

""But the first evening, with the surroundings of Durdle Door, the sunset, the feeling of what we had just achieved together... It was the perfect moment.""

After putting so much time and energy into creating their van, the couple, who also detail their adventures in the van on their Instagram account , are hugely proud of it, and say they often get compliments from onlookers.

""We'll be parked up and sitting on the bed having a glass of wine or whatever and people are constantly coming to ask if they can have a look inside,"" says Hitchcock.",https://cnn.com/travel/article/travelers-who-converted-campervans/index.html
240,The world's most challenging cruise ship routes,"Editor's Note — Monthly Ticket is a new CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In April, we're setting course for the diverse world of cruises. Whether you're looking for travel inspiration or insider knowledge, Monthly Ticket will take you there.

(CNN) — Navigating a colossal ship is no mean feat under any conditions, but certain routes, like the sandstorm-prone, narrow Suez Canal -- infamously blocked by a container ship last year -- or the windy, glacier-lined waterways of Alaska, are particularly challenging.

Andy Winbow, a master mariner who has helmed vessels across the globe, tells CNN Travel that trickier routes are often characterized by ""adverse weather conditions, a lack of room to maneuver due to natural hazards and a lack of navigational aids.""

These factors will impact any vessel, but multi-decked cruise ships can be more affected due to their sheer bulk.

""The higher the ship, the bigger the windage,"" is how David Pembridge puts it. Pembridge is a retired cruise ship captain who worked for decades on ships operated by P&O Cruises and Princess Cruises.

When tall ships are buffeted by wind, they're prone to slide slipping -- a term used to describe a ship that's being blown sideways. To counteract this effect, the ship has to be steered at an angle.

This maneuver is extra tricky when traversing a waterway like the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. In these narrow channels, ships should also avoid hitting the sides of the canal.

""If they go through at speed, it causes erosion of the banks, and drags some of the sand away from the sides and into the center of the canal, which is no good because it makes it less deep, so it causes shallowing,"" explains Pembridge.

While the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal have some unifying features, there are also key differences between the Egyptian waterway and the South American channel.

Where the Panama Canal is largely bordered by forest and vegetation, the Suez is flanked by flat desert, meaning there's potential for poor visibility caused by sandstorms.

And while the 120-mile Suez is largely straight, the roughly 50-mile Panama Canal ""winds in and out of islands,"" as Pembridge puts it, with this topography adding another dimension to the challenge.

""It's a different sort of difficulty, but it still requires fairly intense concentration going through there,"" explains Pembridge.

Ships traversing the Panama Canal must also pass through three different sets of locks. In more recent years the locks were widened to better accommodate bigger ships, but when Pembridge was sailing the route regularly, his vessel would be separated from the sides of the lock by only a couple of feet.

In Panama, mechanical locomotives also help tow cruise ships through the locks, while in especially narrow sections of the Suez, tug boats help guide larger ships.

""It's normally a long day for the team on board, because you start and you don't stop until you get through the other end,"" says Pembridge of passing through both channels.

The role of the pilot

All vessels operating in the Suez and the Panama are aided by local mariners.

These seafarers, known as marine pilots, board the ship at the start of the channel and work together with the on board crew to ensure safe passage.

The Suez Canal and the Panama Canal are both ""compulsory pilotage areas"" -- meaning pilots aren't optional, they're required by law.

Pembridge suggests the working relationship between pilots and captains isn't always smooth sailing.

""That's one of the helps, and one of the hindrances, at times, depending upon the level of competency and personalities involved,"" he says.

""The pilot legally must direct the cause and speed of the vessel. But at the same time, the master of the vessel always has the responsibility for the safe navigation of the vessel and that can't be abrogated to the pilot.""

In some areas, the pilot's role is less crucial, and not necessarily a legal requirement. But in more challenging ports and waterways -- such as Suez and Panama, or the waterways around Alaska, their role is essential.

Captain John Herring was captain of a research vessel before he become a marine pilot in southeast Alaska.

Herring tells CNN Travel there are two key reasons why pilots need to be on board ships in certain areas.

""First, we provide local knowledge of route dangers, tides and currents, weather, concentrations of marine life, and more,"" he explains.

""Second, being independent from the ship, we bring objective decision making not subject to the economic pressures of the ship's schedule. Captains are experts on their own ships and we are experts on Alaskan waters.""

Southeast Alaska is a compulsory pilotage area, partly because it's prone to strong winds and currents, and partly because of its marine ecosystem.

""Alaska coastal waters are blessed with an abundance of marine mammals,"" says Herring. ""Whale watching is a favorite pastime for passengers, but it requires constant vigilance on the bridge to avoid close encounters.""

Similarly, spotting icebergs and glaciers might be a highlight of an Alaskan cruise, but these icy formations can cause difficulties for vessels.

""That ice is hard and can damage the hull or propellers,"" explains Herring, adding that strong winds and currents make navigating icy waters even harder.

In recent years, technology has advanced, making navigating unpredictable routes a bit easier for vessels.

But Herring suggests pilots are still integral in the age of satellite technology.

""The local pilot can still bring the ship safely to port without GPS,"" he says.

Ships sailing around Alaska must also contend with varying water depths. In shallow water channels, ships need to move slowly to avoid creating a low-pressure zone under the vessel that could cause the ship to ground on the seabed.

""Ships can 'squat' if traveling too fast and thus have insufficient clearance under the keel,"" is how master mariner Andy Winbow explains it.

Cruise routes around the Norwegian fjords and the fjords and channels of Chile also involve navigating occasional shallow waters.

Other cruise ship routes present issues because their topography is constantly changing.

Pembridge gives the example of the Amazon River, sections of which are sometimes traversed on South American cruises.

""The bottom of the Amazon moves around continuously and so on a nautical chart it will show an island, and when you get there the island won't be there, it'll have moved somewhere else,"" he explains. ""It's very much dependent on the pilots then -- the local pilots are people that know the river and know how it's moved.""

City ports can also pose challenges.

Pembridge points to the Dutch ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the German port of Hamburg, as well as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.

To dock in any of these cities, cruise ships must first traverse a narrow channel, and how easy that is largely depends on weather conditions.

Planning and unexpected moments

A solid voyage plan is essential to smooth sailing. Pembridge explains that cruise ship passage plans are usually devised by a junior officer, and then approved by the captain. Plans will always take into account any known potential challenges -- like wind, width of waterway, tides and surrounding terrain.

""If you're in open ocean, it's a relatively simple briefing -- this is the course we intend to take, this is the speed we intend to be doing. Once you get closer to land, and it becomes more involved, then you start to highlight dangers, any currents, and the likely weather effects of anything,"" says Pembridge.

""And then as you get into really confined waters -- which is what the [Suez and Panama] canals are -- then it's a much more intense briefing.""

The threat of piracy is another factor that's taken into consideration, although Pembridge suggests it's less of an issue than it once was.

He recalls helming ships that sped through the Gulf of Arden at flank speed, turning lights out at night and organizing passenger drills.

Weather is also taken into account when voyage planning, but all the preparation in the world can't totally account for the unexpected.

Pembridge recalls a time he was captaining a ship sailing from the Falkland Islands towards South America. Wind was forecast to be strong, but when night fell, the violent gusts were much fiercer than expected.

All through the night, Pembridge and his team slowly angled into the waves to try and counteract the impact of the wind. When daylight drew in, they saw the extent of what they were dealing with.

""They were very, very big waves. And the front of the ship was burying itself into them and coming up again, it was perfectly safe, but very uncomfortable.""

By the time the weather had receded, the ship had veered some 30 miles off course. Ports had to be rearranged and the voyage replanned.

But Pembridge points out that while vessels might encounter unexpected challenges, the vessels and the people in charge are generally prepared for obstacles.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/challenging-cruise-ship-routes/index.html

Get news about destinations opening and closing, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.

(CNN) — Over the recent Easter break, social media feeds were filled with photos of happy travelers, many taking their first overseas trips since the start of the pandemic.

Ski holidays in Switzerland. Beach breaks in Thailand. That long-promised family trip to Disney World.

In fact, so many travelers are hitting the road that experts are already predicting a summer of travel chaos lies ahead, as the industry struggles to cope in the face of reduced capacity and decreased workforces.

'A highly uneven recovery'

A scroll through the UNWTO's Destination Tracker reveals the majority of the places reliant on tourism dollars have dropped quarantine restrictions and are welcoming travelers -- albeit some still come with a few caveats such as mandatory Covid-19 tests on arrival, tests before you fly, mandatory quarantines if tests come back positive and so on.

But while most of world's popular destinations have reopened, there are a few tourism favorites that remain off limits to leisure travelers -- regardless of their willingness to test, get vaccinated and quarantine.

And the bulk of them are in the Asia-Pacific region.

""We are beginning to see the early signs of a recovery with markets such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia and Cambodia relaxing their restrictions and initiating a recovery,"" says Liz Ortiguera, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), which is made up of 650 member organizations, including government tourism bodies, travel agencies and airports.

""However, there remains a number of major markets in the region that are virtually closed from an international capacity perspective. The region as a whole is experiencing a highly uneven recovery.""

Japan eases entry restrictions -- but tourists still left out

Tourists keen to hit the fish markets of Tokyo will have to wait a bit longer to get their sushi fix.

Japan continues to relax its strict entry measures -- the limit on the number of new arrivals per day has been raised to 10,000 persons effective April 10, 2022 -- but this does not include leisure tourists.

For the moment, citizens, residents, researchers, students, residents' family members and business travelers with prior approval can enter. Some face quarantine, depending on where they are arriving from.

So when will Japan reopen to holidaymakers? The question of timing came up during a press conference held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on April 8; however, no specific plan was announced.

""We will have to continue to make appropriate decisions based on the infection situation and international movements in each country,"" he said. ""It has not been determined yet.""

China battles to contain outbreaks

In Shanghai, once seen as a haven for foreigners, there is a sudden rush to get out. Harsh Covid restrictions are not only crushing social freedoms and grounding businesses to a halt in the financial hub, but they're also making access to basic necessities near impossible for some. CNN's David Culver talks to quarantined expats about what they're experiencing.

Much has been said about how the world's tourism economy won't truly recover until China's citizens are able to travel abroad again.

In 2019, the number of outbound tourists from China hit 155 million, according to the China Tourism Academy, making it the world's largest market for outbound travel.

For now, Chinese citizens are strongly discouraged from traveling abroad and those who do face at least two weeks of quarantine upon return, sometimes more.

But what about foreign tourists willing to put in the quarantine time in return for a holiday?

Those wishing to fulfill their lifelong dream of walking along the Great Wall will have to wait to take those steps. Foreign nationals are not permitted to enter for leisure tourism at this time.

As for a reopening timeline, back in October 2021 the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said China may open its borders after it vaccinates over 85% of its population ""by early 2022.""

Though that vaccination target has been met , the country remains committed to its zero-Covid strategy as it struggles to contain outbreaks in several cities, making it highly unlikely global tourists will be welcomed back in the near future.

Bad news for travelers wanting to hit the tables in Asia's most famous gambling destination and enjoy some Macanese cuisine . There haven't been any signs that Macao will be opening its borders to the world anytime soon.

Tourists are still prohibited from entering the special administrative region, with the exception of visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. And even those who can enter have to quarantine for two weeks, with the exception of those arriving from certain Chinese cities

According to one government news release issued in mid-April, business travelers and students from outside mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong will also be permitted to enter in the near future. But few details have been given.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong officials have announced that from May 1, the city will allow non-residents to enter for the first time in over two years. Though technically it will be possible to visit as a tourist, a 7-day quarantine awaits and flight cancellations are a regular occurrence

Taiwan, one of Asia's favorite culinary destinations , has been easing its travel restrictions over the last two months.

Foreign business travelers have been allowed to visit the island since March 7. From April 12, foreign relatives and Taiwan residents with a valid alien resident certificate have been able to apply to visit as well.

Other travelers now welcome include those with a work/study visa, those coming for investment or business purposes, or visitors entering on humanitarian grounds.

And they're all subjected to 10 days of hotel or home quarantine

Leisure tourists, however, are still unable to visit.

As more destinations are reopening their borders, Chen Shih-chung, Taiwan's Minister of Health and Welfare, said in February that the island had to consider easing travel restrictions so it wouldn't lag behind in terms of economic development.

Without offering a concrete reopening date, Chen also said that the current restrictions would be further lifted and non-business travelers will be allowed entry if the spread of the virus remains under control.

Several Pacific islands remain off limits

According to a report titled ""Asia's Travel-Ready Index 2022,"" released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) last week, island nations including Vanuatu and Fiji are among the most dependent on tourism in the region.

Fiji, where tourism accounts for 40% of the economy, reopened in late 2021 . It tops the EIU's travel-readiness index, which looks at the three factors that might affect international tourists' sentiment: vaccination coverage in the destination; the ease of traveling to the destination; and quarantine requirements when they return to their place of residence.

Other Pacific island destinations that have reopened to tourists include Tahiti, Palau and the Cook Islands.

242,Green jet fuel is here -- so why are airlines not using it?,"(CNN) — There is a small chance that your next flight will be powered, at least in part, by used cooking oils or agricultural waste.

These are among the ingredients of SAF -- Sustainable Aviation Fuel -- a new type of jet fuel that promises to curb carbon emissions by 80% on average, according to IATA , the International Air Transport Association.

The first commercial flights using SAF took off in 2011, and it has since grown to become a key element in making air transport more sustainable.

The aviation industry has pledged that, by 2050, its global carbon emissions will be half that of what they were in 2005. It then hopes to reach net zero, or the complete absence of emissions, as early as a decade after that. That's an extremely ambitious plan, and one in which SAF accounts for 50% to 75% of the total reduction in emissions , depending on the different scenarios that can play out between now and then.

And yet in 2019 -- the last year of business as usual before the pandemic -- SAF accounted for just 0.1% of all jet fuel used worldwide, according to the World Economic Forum . So why aren't airlines using more of it?

Scaling up

SAF is a ""drop in"" fuel, which means it can be used now, in existing aircraft, with little or no modifications.

""This is critical and very beneficial for the aviation industry, because there is no need to invest in new infrastructure or new aircraft, and it's great for airports too, because they can use the same storage and fueling infrastructure -- from that perspective, SAF is excellent,"" says Andreas Schafer, a professor of energy and transport at University College London.

In its bid to become more sustainable, aviation is also looking at next-generation technologies like hydrogen and electric-powered flight, but these require transformational changes that are still many years away. As Boeing's CEO David Calhoun put it , SAF is ""the only answer between now and 2050.""

Related content An A380 superjumbo just completed a flight powered by cooking oil

SAF has a low carbon footprint because it's made from waste products, where the carbon has already been emitted, or from plants that use up CO2 to grow.

The problem is that it's currently much more expensive to produce than regular jet fuel, even with today's elevated oil prices.

""There's no real business case for the sector to invest in it at the moment,"" explains Schafer, meaning that airlines have no incentive to use SAF other than to reduce emissions -- but at current prices and amidst a global crisis brought on by Covid, that is a luxury they can't afford.

To make the price go down, production needs to ramp up significantly and new types of SAF must come to the market.

Today, most SAF comes in the form of biofuel produced from waste fats such as used cooking oil, or from oil trees purposely grown on degraded land. However, there is not enough of these raw materials right now to supply the industry at a meaningful scale.

Powered by trash

In the near future, higher-cost biofuel could be produced from agricultural waste products, such as plant stems or husks, and residues from wood processing, as well as non-edible plants grown on purpose like miscanthus, similar to bamboo.

Even municipal waste, the household trash that often goes to landfill, has the potential to be turned into SAF.

Finally, further ahead, we will be able to make another type of SAF called ""power to liquid."" This method uses renewable energy to extract hydrogen from water and then mix it with CO2 taken directly from the air. The result is a synthetic liquid fuel that is carbon neutral and comes in a potentially endless supply -- enough to satisfy the demand of the entire aviation industry.

According to a cost analysis run by Schafer and his team, current SAF made from waste oils costs at least 50% more than regular jet fuel.

The second type, the higher-cost biofuel, can go for up to three times as much, and the ""power to liquid"" one comes at nearly four times the price of jet fuel. And that's based on oil prices of $100 per barrel -- the difference will only increase if oil prices go back to lower levels.

How can we bring these costs down?

""We need to expand the production of low-cost biofuels and then invest into the production of high-cost ones and power to liquid,"" says Schafer.

""Several thousand production plants need to be built. And that's not all, because you need the renewable power generation infrastructure for power to liquid. And that's gigantic: half the electricity produced today globally would be required for the aviation sector in 2050. So the scale is enormous, and we better get started soon.""

A challenging future

The first commercial flight that used a blend of biofuels and regular jet fuel was operated by KLM in 2011, but test flights date back to 2008, with Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand among the earliest adopters.

Since then, many major airlines have used SAF in commercial flights, including SAS, Lufthansa, Qantas, Alaska and United, among others: according to IATA , over 370,000 flights with SAF in the fuel mix have taken off since 2016 alone. Aircraft and engine manufacturers are also conducting tests, signaling a global interest. In March 2022, for example, Airbus flew an A380 for three hours powering one of its Rolls-Royce engines entirely with SAF made from cooking oil and other waste fats.

However, progress has slowed down due to the pandemic, and the industry's pre-Covid goal of reaching 2% use of SAF by 2025 -- from 0.1% in 2019 -- now seems doubtful.

""We're certainly behind the 2025 goal and I think it's unlikely that we'll get there naturally,"" says Glenn McDonald, an aviation analyst at Aerodynamic Advisory, suggesting that outside intervention is needed to make SAF more attractive, either via subsidies that make it cheaper or via a carbon tax that makes traditional jet fuel more expensive.

It doesn't help that aviation is a global and fragmented industry with rules and regulations that vary from one country to the next. It's likely that progress will be uneven: Norway, for example, has mandated since 2020 that 0.5% of all jet fuel used domestically must be SAF, a share that must grow to 30% by 2030.

Preference shift

Airbus has flown the A380 superjumbo for three hours powered by SAF. Airbus

According to McDonald, there are encouraging signs.

""Airlines are starting to take it more seriously because they see a shift in consumer preferences, especially among younger travelers, and they know they will have to meet these goals in order to be a viable industry in the 2050s,"" he says.

""A common refrain we hear in the aerospace and aviation sector is that we don't want to become the new tobacco industry, where the business model isn't aligned with public policy and consumer attitudes.""

For passengers, the shift to SAF might be entirely unnoticeable, because no visible aspect of a flight is affected by the change in fuel.

However, as airlines feel more pressure to use SAF before its cost aligns with regular jet fuel -- no sooner than the 2030s according to the World Economic Forum -- they might offload some of the costs on passengers, resulting in an increase in fares of up to 15%, according to Schafer.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/saf-jet-fuel-green/index.html

(CNN) — With pandemic travel restrictions easing in much of the region, the annual Asia's 50 Best Bars ceremony took place in front of a live audience for the first time since 2019 on Thursday evening.

A celebration of the region's best bars and the people behind them, the 2022 event was held at Bangkok's Mandarin Oriental hotel.

As usual, it was a showdown between Hong Kong and Singapore for the top spot, with last year's winner, Coa, holding onto first place for the second year in a row.

The Hong Kong bar, set in a candle-lit space with industrial-style interiors, is named after a machete-like tool used to harvest agave -- the plant from which mezcal and tequila are distilled. Both of these spirits feature prominently in Coa's cocktails, including La Paloma de Oaxaca, which includes a blend of grapefruit-spiked mezcal and tequila.

Singapore's Jigger & Pony, located in the city's Amara Hotel, grabbed the number two spot. Named after the double-coned measuring device used by bartenders, it offers a menu of 24 cocktails -- many of them fresh interpretations of classic drinks such as the Yuzu Whiskey Sour, made with Maker's Mark Bourbon, yuzu marmalade, St Germain, lemon and egg white.

Four Seasons Hong Kong-based Argo came in at number three on this year's list. Its unique cocktail menu includes drinks fueled by spirit innovations, such as an AI-produced gin and molecular-aged whisky.

Meanwhile, the only bar in the top 10 not based in a major city, Tesouro opened during the pandemic in the beach village of Colva in Goa, India. Number four on this year's list, it features Goan-Portuguese design elements and cocktails made with fine rum, craft gins, agave spirits and the local Goan-distilled spirit feni.

Tokyo's Bar Benfiddich earned the number five spot, Taipei's Indulge Experimental Bistro came in at number six, while Charles H in Seoul landed at number seven this year.

Though Singapore missed out on the top spot, it has more bars in the top 50 than any other city. Eleven venues on the 2022 Asia list are based in the city-state, including this year's number 8, MO Bar, and former number one, Manhattan, which came in at number 9 this year.

Bangkok's new BKK Social Club, located in the Four Seasons at Chao Phraya River, rounded out the top 10 list.

Part of the World's 50 Best Bars brand owned by William Reed Ltd., the Asia list is based on the votes of the Asia's 50 Best Bars Academy, which is made up of members of the bar industry, media and mixology experts in the region.

""Asia's bars have shown remarkable resilience and growth in spite of the challenges of the past two years, and we continue to be proud to celebrate the talent and creativity on display in bars all across Asia,"" said Mark Sansom, content director for Asia's 50 Best Bars, in a statement.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/asia-best-bars-2022/index.html
244,The delicious snack you can only find in Venice,"Editor's Note — The new season of "" Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy "" starts this Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Don't miss the premiere where Tucci travels to Venice to try the local delicacies from baccalà mantecato to squid ink risotto.

(CNN) — ""Cicchetti is the glue that holds Venice together,"" says mask maker Sergio Boldrin of Bottega dei Mascareri . ""It is impossible to think of finishing work without stopping for a drink and a snack on the way home, meeting friends, catching up on the news of the day.""

Ask a Venetian to define cicchetti and you will get as many answers as there are varieties of the tasty finger food. In a town that moves by foot or by boat, munching on cicchetti while having a glass of wine called an ombra and chatting with friends in a bar called a bacaro is a fundamental part of life in Venice.

Cicchetti can include everything from squiggly sea creatures impaled on toothpicks, and fried meatballs called polpette, to colorful toppings spread on slices of baguette called crostini -- and that's just for starters. Traditionally, you eat them standing at a bar, or just outside the door. The ritual of having a drink and a snack in a welcoming setting is what's key -- this is not street food to be eaten while strolling around town.

Related content Venice to charge daytrippers up to €10 to enter in 2023

Cicchetti are inexpensive, costing about €1 - €5 ($1.10 - $5.50), depending on the ingredients. Each cicchetto is as creative as the individual who invents it, which makes going on a giro de ombre -- a bacaro crawl -- a chance to taste the soul of Venice.

Like many Venetian traditions, the actual cicchetti locals consume have transformed throughout the decades, but the ritual remains the same. In Italian, the word ""ombra"" means shadow or shade; ""ombre"" is the plural. According to legend, centuries ago vendors sold wine in St. Mark's Square, following the shade of the Campanile (the giant belltower) with their carts to keep the wine cool. The result? The expression ""un'ombra di vino"" or ""a shadow of wine.""

Venetians don't like to drink on an empty stomach, so ""cichéti"" were born, believed to come from the Latin ""ciccus"" meaning ""small amount."" The initial offerings were simple morsels like boiled octopus or a hard-boiled egg topped with an anchovy. Establishments called ""bàcari"" evolved to serve ombre and cicchetti, said to be inspired by an old Venetian expression to ""far bàcara"" or ""to celebrate"" -- a term which itself might have evolved from Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and pleasure.

Over at Rialto, the one-time headquarters of international trade at the foot of the world-famous bridge, merchants conducted their business in the shade of the Church of San Giacomo di Rialto (known locally as San Giacometo), next to Banco Giro, the circulating credit bank. Cicchetti washed down with an ombra was a type of fast food eaten by traders to complete business quickly while standing on their feet when there was no time to lose. Or so the story goes.

Tuna and cocoa cicchetti

Stanley Tucci went in search of cicchetti in ""Searching for Italy."" CNN

A glass display case filled with a kaleidoscope of sliced baguettes smeared with exotic toppings is the centerpiece of Schiavi in the Dorsoduro district. Also called ""Bottegon,"" the bar started life as a wine cellar at the end of the 19th century. In addition to dozens of fresh cicchetti, it serves about 25 wines by the glass as well as selling hundreds of bottles from the Veneto region, including wines from the estates of the local aristocracy. You will find owner Alessandra De Respinis behind the counter every morning, chatting with her clientele as she prepares her savory snacks.

When De Respinis' father-in-law, Sisto Gastaldi, took over the bacaro in 1945, there were plenty of ombre, but the only cicchetti offered were pickled onions speared by anchovies, mortadella and green peppers, and hard-boiled eggs. De Respinis started working at Schiavi in 1970 after Sisto's death and her husband, Lino Gastaldi, stepped into his father's shoes. Expanding Schiavi's cicchetti menu became her life's mission and she began inventing her own tasty morsels to accompany the glasses of wine.

Related content The flood barriers that might save Venice

De Respinis sliced fresh, crispy baguettes into bite-sized pieces that you could eat with two fingers. Tuna and leek, and gorgonzola and walnuts topped her initial creations. As she found her rhythm, her imagination was sparked by seasonal ingredients. She experimented by mixing and matching colors and flavors, inventing new cicchetti devoured by the locals.

Now in her seventies, De Respinis has a team of offspring providing support, but she still works every day until noon. She has created about 70 different specialties, including her award-winning tartare di tonno e cacao: tuna mixed with egg yolk, capers, mayonnaise, and parsley, then sprinkled with bitter cocoa.

""My motto is to always serve fresh food,"" says De Respinis. ""At the end of the day, we offer whatever is left to the last customers, or eat it ourselves.""

'Cicchetti was humble food'

Modern cicchetti -- baguette slices layered with toppings -- are thought to have been invented by Alessandra De Respinis. CNN

""There are no cicchetti in Venice anymore!"" thunders 73-year-old Franco Filippi. ""The last real bacaro closed in 1980.""

Filippi is the owner of Libreria Editrice Filippi, a bookshop specializing in all things Venetian and the oldest publishing house in town. He can trace his family's roots in Venice back to the year 1340. He doesn't own a television and has spent 40 years trying to decipher the ""Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,"" that mysterious Renaissance book published by Aldo Manuzio in Venice in 1499 that has puzzled great thinkers for centuries.

Related content The island where Venice began

When it comes to cicchetti, Filippi is an old-fashioned purist. In fact, he recently published a book by Sandro Brandolisio entitled ""Cichéti"" (spelled the Venetian way), featuring recipes that the bacari prepared in the 1950s and '60s.

""Cicchetti was humble food made from spienza, the spleen, or trippa rissa, tripe -- no part of the animal went to waste,"" says Filippi. ""It was prepared by the wife and sold by the husband and son. When we went on a giro de ombre, it was because Maria made the best meatball on Tuesday, and Sofia made the best octopus on Wednesday. But all those bacari are gone.""

Today there are hundreds of places to eat cicchetti scattered throughout the bacari and osterie of Venice, but Filippi is adamant. ""Crostini -- spreading a topping on a slice of bread -- is not cicchetti!""

Where (else) to eat cicchetti

Today, there are myriad cicchetti on offer. CNN

Wander through the calli on the western side of the Rialto Bridge, in the San Polo district, and you'll stumble upon several good bacari serving an assortment of cicchetti in various incarnations. Despite Filippi's pronouncements, crostini are ubiquitous, and it seems that the Alessandra De Respinis' recipes at Schiavi may have inspired many bacari to follow her lead, adorning slices of baguette with creative inventions.

Tiny All'Arco is always jammed with locals. Playing in the background is the musical sound of undulating Venetian voices that ebb and flow like the water lapping in the lagoon. There are dozens of ever-changing fresh crostini depending on the season, from shrimp to prosciutto and everything in between, as well as small tables outside to enjoy them.

Cantina Do Spade has been around since 1488 and was one of Casanova's old haunts -- in Chapter 17 of his erotic memoir, ""A Story of My Life,"" he tells the tale of how he and seven of his friends seduced a young married woman in a back room of Do Spade during the Carnival of 1745. You can join the revelers out in the calle for meatballs or grilled squid, or sit down for a meal at the wooden tables inside.

In the next street over is the even older Cantina Do Mori, founded in 1462, which also claims Casanova as a former regular. Here you will find a local Venetian crowd and folk who do business in the area with a dash of tourists, and no seating other than a handful of stools. The dark wooden interior radiates antiquity, offering classic cicchetti and a good selection of wine.

According to tradition, Venice was born at noon on March 25, 421 CE in Campo San Giacomo at the foot of the Rialto Bridge. Five bistros -- Osteria Banco Giro, Ancòra, Osteria Al Pesador, Caffè Vergnano 1882 Rialto and Naranzaria -- share the prime location like one big living room, where you can stand in the campo to feast on one side, or pay more to sit at a table and gaze at the Grand Canal on the other. They all serve different variations of cicchetti. Banco Giro has transformed from 17th-century bank to 21st-century osteria, and stands out with its fluffy homemade baccalà mantecato, a Venetian standard made from Norwegian stockfish, which is creamed and spread on crostini.

The northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, has been under regular heavy bombardment since Russia began its invasion more than six weeks ago.

On Sunday, Mook shared an update from Kharkiv, indicating that the injured staff ""were doing well"" and the restaurant team were in the process of moving ""all food products & non-damaged equipment"" to another location in the city.

""The work doesn't stop,"" he added.

Andrés has also taken to Twitter to address the strike, as well as provide an update on the well being of staff at the restaurant.

The Spanish chef has also spoken out against the Russian attacks and called for a halt to the fighting.

""Please stop killing civilians non-stop day and night. That's why people are afraid, that's why a lot of people are still in bunkers, its why many people, they don't want to be in the comfort homes and many nights, they go to the safety of the subway,"" he said. ""That's why, again, this war needs to end.""

On April 15, Andrés shared a graphic detailing the scale of the organization's operation in Ukraine, including setting up over 300 restaurants and delivering over 300,000 meals a day.

246,9 of the world's best wellness retreats,"(CNN) — Being pummeled by strangers, soaked in aromatic waters, or encouraged to throw yoga shapes in beautiful surroundings isn't going to erase the problems of the past two years.

247,The travelers who created their own cozy campervans,"(CNN) — Search the #vanlife hashtag on Instagram and you'll find millions of posts from travelers on the road in tiny homes on wheels.

While some van lifers will have opted to buy readymade campervans, more and more are choosing to buy a van or bus and convert it themselves.

Of course, this is hardly a new phenomenon. Campervan conversions have been around since at least the 1950s.

However, their popularity has skyrocketed in recent years. Demand had already increasing significantly before the pandemic, partly due to the numerous YouTube channels and Instagram posts devoted to DIY van conversions.

But interest went through the roof as many people found themselves stuck at home with little to do as borders shut down and restrictions were put in place in many destinations around the world.

""People wanted to get out. They wanted to get away from other people and stay safe, and we were all limited in what we could do,"" Brian Jagodnik, marketing and creative director at Outside Van, a luxury van conversion company in Portland, Oregon, told CNN Business last year.

""It pushed people outside and to travel away from others and take the road less traveled, and so the industry just continued to grow.""

As a result, the #vanlife community is expanding further, with an increasing amount of travelers, many of whom may have already been mulling over whether or not to get a van, making the decision to buy one, and in some cases, do it up themselves.

So how difficult is a DIY campervan conversion? And are video tutorials and social media posts really enough to get you through a van build? Here, we talk to a number of travelers who've taken the plunge themselves.

""It's functional and not too fancy""

Dale Comley and Charlie Low spent over a year converting their van into a campervan. Climbingvan

Dale Comley and Charlie Low, both from the UK, purchased a yellow Mercedes Sprinter for £8,000 (around $10,500) in 2019 and spent roughly £6,500 ($8,500) converting it into a campervan. The couple now live in their van Ringo full time and have written a book about van conversions together.

Investing in a van was a no-brainer for Comley and Low who met on a climbing trip and have been together for almost six years.

""It's something that we both always wanted to do since we met,"" Low tells CNN Travel.

""We're both from a climbing background, and climbing and van life are fairly synonymous. If you go to any climbing areas, you'll see lots of vans. We decided to take the plunge in June 2019.""

Like many other travelers, they chose to buy a van and convert it themselves rather than splashing out on a readymade motorhome. That way they could create something that was tailored to their needs and tastes.

""The great opportunity with converting your own van is that you don't need to fall into the trap of essentially buying a motorhome and being stuck with one layout,"" says Comley. ""You can truly create whatever you want.""

Once they'd purchased the van, the couple parked it at Low's mother's house, where they had more space to work, and took time out to plan the design and layout.

""I'd say the most common mistake that people make is, if anything, is spending more time converting the van than actually using it,"" says Comley. Climbingvan

""We're both fairly practical,"" says Comley. ""So we spent a long time designing so that we essentially got it right the first time.""

They completed a lot of research on YouTube, but say they found that everyone had different ideas about the best way of doing things.

""There wasn't really a definitive single source of information,"" says Comley. ""There were hundreds or thousands of opinions that weren't really founded in any sort of fact. It was all personal experience.""

They began by gutting the van, before fitting in windows, as well as skylights and solar panels. The next step was insulating the van, before installing the electrical system and cladding.

They then built their bed, their kitchen, with a Belfast sink, overhead cabinets and other necessary structures, before installing the water and gas systems.

Once all of that was done, they were able to begin decorating their mobile home, which meant painting the walls, putting tiles in the kitchen area and upholstering the seats.

Although they had a few false starts, where they followed someone else's method and found there was ""something fundamentally wrong with what we'd been told to do,"" the pair, who documented the entire process on their Instagram account , say the build went smoothly overall.

""Provided you've got a bit of a process to follow, and you spend some time designing it, there's not really any single job that is very difficult,"" says Comley.

""All of the practical stuff is quite quick and simple. You don't really need any specialist tools and you don't really need any experience.""

If in doubt, travelers have the option to hire professionals to help with parts of the build they're less confident about.

""It's very possible to just outsource one part of your van build,"" adds Low.

The couple say it took just over a year, or the equivalent of around 1,000 hours between them, to complete the van.

""It [the van] is a nice standard. It's functional and not too fancy, which is basically us. So it would be quite easy to spend significantly more [or less] if you wanted to,"" says Comley.

""Our original plan was that once we'd finished the van, we'd go traveling for a year,"" says Low.

""But what happened in reality was that we finished the van, and then a week later, the UK went into lockdown. So it was fairly appalling timing.""

It was at this point that they decided to write a book, "" The Van Conversion Bible ,"" with the aim of preventing others from making some of the same mistakes they did.

""You can kind of fall from one hole into another, into another, into another,"" explains Comley. ""Some cost you financially, and some cost you time.

""So that's really why we wrote the book. To try to help people avoid as many of those holes as possible.""

The couple, who also have a van conversion blog, were finally able to go on the road when travel restrictions eased around the world, and have since traveled to France, Switzerland, Spain, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Croatia.

The couple are now enjoying life on the road, and say they wouldn't change a thing about their van, Ringo. Climbingvan

""It [the van] is going to allow us to explore countries that realistically, we probably would never have gotten to,"" says Comley.

They've been living in their van Ringo for around a year now, and believe that anyone can convert a van, provided they stay focused and think of the project in stages

""When you think about converting a van, it feels quite scary, potentially, and not possible,"" says Low.

""But if you break it down into all of the different things you need to do, and then you kind of learn about each individual thing, it makes it feel a lot more manageable.

Comley also recommends that travelers try going on at least one van trip before even thinking about spending time and money on a conversion.

""Make sure you actually like it,"" he says. ""Irrespective of how good it [the van] is, you're going to spend a lot of time and probably money working on it.

""I'd say the most common mistake that people make is, if anything, is spending more time converting the van than actually using it.""

'I did all of it myself'

Jennifer Mckechnie from Northern Ireland bought a minibus for £2,300 (nearly $3,000) in 2019 and spent around £3,500 (around $4,564) converting it into the campervan of her dreams. The former fitness instructor has since set up her own campervan conversion business and completed six conversions last year.

""I used to go snowboarding every year to Chamonix,"" Mckechnie tells CNN Travel. ""And I remember being in a bar once and I saw a video of a guy who had a van. He was traveling around snowboarding. I thought, 'Oh, I'd love to do that.' ""

One of the biggest attractions of van life for Mckechnie was that she'd be able to travel around with her two huskies in tow.

""I love traveling to different countries and going snowboarding, but I've always wanted to take my dogs with me. So it [getting the van] was purely so that I could drive to Chamonix and bring them along.""

After spending a bit of time watching YouTube videos and reading articles on how to convert a van, she purchased one in 2019.

While Mckechnie had planned to work on the van on weekends mainly, she found herself with a great deal of time on her hands when the pandemic set in and she was unable to work.

""Everything else in the world was closed,"" she explains. ""So I didn't have anything else to do.""

She began by stripping out all of the seats in the van -- there were 17 in total -- before removing the walls and floor.

""I basically stripped it back to a bare metal shell, and then started from there,"" says Mckechnie.

The next step was covering corrosion on the floor with rust converter, then filling in gaps in the walls, floor and ceiling and insulating the van.

After installing the walls, the ceiling and the electrics, Mckechnie took some time out to design the layout of the van.

""The biggest problem was that builders merchants and things like that were closed,"" she says. ""So it was hard to get materials.""

Mckechnie was able to complete all of the labor herself and says she spent a total of 100 days on the build.

""I had my dad help me put the ceiling up, as it takes two sets of hands to do that,"" she explains. ""But I did all of it myself.""

A friend persuaded her to share a video of her renovation work on TikTok, and Mckechnie was soon inundated with messages from travelers asking her to build them a van.

""Everyone was saying, 'I want one. Can you build me one?'"" she says. The post went on to receive around 14 million views.

Once she'd mulled things over, Mckechnie eventually said ""yes"" to one of the van build requests.

""I decided that I'd give it a go,"" she says. ""And if it didn't work, I'd just go back to doing what I was doing.""

However, Mckechnie went on to receive so many bookings that she decided to quit her day job and set up a bespoke van company. She now spends her days building custom campervans for other travelers and says business is booming.

""This was never the plan,"" she says. ""But here we are.""

Once her own van was complete, Mckechnie went on her first road trip with her dogs and says everything went smoothly.

""I did have a couple of people ask 'what happens if you hit a speed bump? Does it all fall off?' she says. ""But it actually went really well and the dogs enjoyed it. The only thing that probably moved would be the cushions.""

Ironically, the success of her company, Custom Conversions NI , has meant that she hasn't been able to travel in her van much over the last few years.

""The last time that I used my van was August of 2020,"" she admits. ""I'm fully booked for the next 12 months. It's madness.""

However, there's nothing she enjoys more than sending travelers off in a campervan that's been customized just for them.

""They tell me what they want and I build it that way, as opposed to them buying a motorhome or a van that's already been converted and may have things in it that they just don't need,"" she explains.

According to Mckechnie, the most unusual request she's had so far is a sliding wardrobe.

""I did manage to put that in there,"" she says. ""But I think sometimes people forget that we are in a little square box, so you have to think about the necessities.""

Although each traveler will have different ideas on what they consider essential, for Mckechnie the basics tend to be ""a bed, a kitchen, somewhere to charge your phone, a couple of lights, and if you have the space, a portable toilet.""

Mckechnie occasionally helps her customers find a van before beginning a conversion and has noticed that prices have shot up in the three years since she converted her own van.

""They're like gold dust at the moment,"" she says. ""Everyone knows how popular it [van life] is.""

'Our partition wall is quite controversial'

Claire Falconer and Luke Morris spent around four months working on the build for their campervan conversion. Luke Morris and Claire Falconer

In January 2020, Claire Falconer and husband Luke Morris left Dubai and relocated Down Under, where they bought a Mercedes Sprinter for 32,000 Australia dollars (around $23,740) and spent roughly $13,470 converting it into a fabulous home on wheels.

They were both living in Dubai when they first got together, but after several years in the emirate, Falconer and Morris decided to pack up and move to Falconer's native Australia.

""Luke and I have always loved traveling, it's in our blood,"" Falconer tells CNN Travel via email. ""We have seen a lot of the world and it was always my dream to return to Australia one day and finally travel my home country.""

Once they began investigating the different ways they could travel Australia, they decided to go down the van route.

""I didn't really know about the whole van life movement in much detail until I started looking into it, and realized how big and how amazing some of the vans are,"" says Morris. ""I really had no idea what I was getting myself into.""

They say they opted to go with a van instead of a caravan, ""just for the flexibility of being able to park up at the beach and things like that,"" and were keen for something with a high roof so that Morris, who is six foot two inches tall, would be able to stand in it.

The couple purchased a Mercedes Sprinter just a week after arriving in Melbourne, and got started on the build pretty much immediately.

They were working out the layout and some of the finer details when the pandemic hit, and Melbourne went into lockdown in March 2020.

Thankfully one of the few shops that remained open in the city was a hardware store, so they were able to get hold of many of the materials they needed and ""just cracked on with the build for the whole of the lockdown.""

Before the conversion, Falconer and Morris say they'd done very little DIY work other than putting furniture together. However, they threw themselves into the build completely, sharing their experiences on their Instagram account

""It was honestly great; we work super well together as a team,"" says Falconer, who works as a health coach and a yoga teacher. ""Obviously building the van had its tough moments, but for the most part we loved doing it.""

Falconer had been following various van life accounts on social media for a while and says she'd picked up lots of design inspiration.

""When it came to color schemes, she wanted it all white, beachy and quite premium,"" says Morris, who own and runs eco-friendly accessories company Wild Wood.

After a bit of deliberation, they chose to put in a partition wall between the cab and the living space rather than keep the space open.

""That [the partition wall] is quite controversial in the van life world,"" says Morris. ""I guess it's because people generally want access from the cab to the living space, but we didn't see the need for that.""

Although much of the build process went to plan, they found themselves in a sticky situation when they settled on putting up real tiles in the kitchen area and used the wrong type of adhesive, which meant they had to rip them out and start again.

""That was a bit of a nightmare for a couple of days, just because it was so time consuming,"" says Morris.

While Morris was initially determined to complete all of the work himself, he eventually chose to outsource the electrics and the plumbing work to experts so that he could focus on the parts of the build that he felt more comfortable with.

""You need to get an electrical certificate, and a plumbing certificate to actually sign it off as a motor home anyway,"" he adds.

If they happened to be struggling with any part of the build, Falconer and Morris say they would reach out to others for advice.

""People in the van life community are extremely helpful with that kind of thing, they are willing to give you advice and actually help you out,"" says Morris.

The couple say it took around four months to complete the van, with their total spend came to 52,207 Australian dollars (about $38,732) including registration, stamp duty and insurance costs, which was more or less what they'd estimated before beginning.

""Some of the things were a little more expensive [than we thought],"" says Morris. ""But nothing too crazy.""

Falconer and Morris welcomed their son Beau in April 2021 and admit that living in a campervan with a baby has proved to be extremely challenging.

""Our lil' man doesn't stop,"" says Falconer. ""He's so, so active, so we have struggled with that a bit on the road, as its hard to always keep him out of trouble.

""We can't just leave him to play like we would in a house. One of us constantly needs to be on him. But we absolutely love traveling with him and having him by our side at every moment.

""There is something so special about seeing the world through his eyes.""

Due to the regional Covid-19 border restrictions in Australia, they haven't been able to explore as much of the country as they'd have liked, or see many of their family and friends for the past two years.

They're due to visit Asia to see family and friends the coming weeks, but will be taking off in the van again once they return to Australia in a few months time.

""It will be winter here, so we'll be driving north pretty quickly to get into some warmer weather,"" says Morris. ""Then we can finish off doing everything that we missed while borders have been closed. That will be really exciting.""

'My heart and soul went into it'

Van lifer Cori Geiger is hugely proud of her campervan, Cadia. Emily Brianne Photography

Cori Geiger bought a used Ford Transit in 2020 for $36,000 and spent around $19,000 converting it into a campervan that she could live and work in remotely while traveling around the country. She is now based in her van, named Cadia, full time.

Geiger, from Massachusetts, had often dreamed about going on the road in a campervan, but it wasn't until the pandemic set in and her job as a senior project manager went fully remote, that she felt ready to give van life a try.

""I really didn't want to be paying rent in a city,"" Geiger tells CNN Travel. ""I wasn't going to be commuting into an office anymore, and I wasn't ready to buy a house -- prices are crazy in the US right now. So this made the most sense for my life.

""I could work remotely and travel around and see the country at the same time.""

According to Geiger, one of the main reasons she decided to convert the van herself was because pre-built van conversions were significantly more expensive.

""They can be over $100,000,"" she says. ""So I didn't want to go that route, and I wanted the challenge of building it myself. That way I could actually control how much I was spending during the build.""

Geiger had already been watching online videos about van life and tiny homes for a couple years before deciding to build her van, so she had an idea of the type of layouts she liked, as well as how much work she'd need to do.

Once she'd purchased the van, Geiger began the conversion, working her way through the project step by step.

""It starts with building the insulation and prepping the van for everything that you're going to be putting on to it,"" she explains

""That means putting down the floor and the framing that you're going to be drilling the walls into and putting things on the outside.""

Although she had little experience with renovation work before starting the build, Geiger found that she picked things up relatively quickly for the most part.

""My skills were very basic,"" she admits. ""So learning how to use power tools and measuring stuff, that was definitely a learning curve. But it was really fun working through it all.""

Aside from calling on her family to help with tasks that required ""multiple hands,"" Geiger was able to complete the build on her own.

""It was really important to me that my van felt like an apartment or a cozy home,"" she adds. ""The layout was also really important, I had a really big dog at the time -- I now have two dogs.

""So I wanted an open layout where she would be comfortable while I was working full and I wanted an open space.""

Aside from calling on her family when she needed extra hands, Geiger completed the whole conversion herself. Cori Geiger

Geiger was able to achieve this by building a Murphy bed design, which folds out of a wall or cabinet, into the van.

""That really changed the game for me,"" she says. ""It goes down while I'm sleeping, but then it goes back up against the wall, which means I have a lot more space. I have a full living room area.""

Geiger also has a full sink with a large faucet, which she uses as an outdoor shower. She says she spent $3,192 on the exterior accessories, including a ladder, roof racks, and a security system, and an extra $4,236 on building supplies, along with tools, wood and other materials.

The electrical system set her back around $5,667, which included power sockets and wiring, and the plumbing costs worked out to $1,253. Finally, the cost of interior accessories, paint and other design elements came to $5,528.

""I love showing people my van, because my heart and soul went into it,"" she says.

Geiger says she bought the van for $36,000 and spent around $19,000 converting it into a tiny home. Cori Geiger

Geiger set off on the road back in September 2021 and says she hasn't looked back. While she admits that a few issues have cropped up with the van along the way, such as her water pumps freezing up, she's been able to deal with them thanks to the skills she learned during the build.

""Just living van life, there's so many problems that you have to solve every day,"" she says. ""But you get used to it because you built the van, and you had to problem solve through the build.""

Geiger has found being part of van life truly life changing and urges others who are keen to try it out not to wait too long.

""Don't wait for retirement,"" she says. ""I talk to so many people on the road. And the number one thing they say to me is, ""it's awesome that you're doing it so young, I wish I had done it earlier in my life.'

""So if it's something you want to do, you should do it. There will always be hard days and tough days, but you will be so much stronger, happier, fulfilled and proud of yourself after you finish a project like this.""

'Gem's the interior designer, I'm the laborer'

Matthew Dacombe and Gemma Hitchcock show off their van, the Happy Hoppa. Matt & Gem

Matthew Dacombe and Gemma Hitchcock bought a green wheelchair accessible minibus for £4,500 (around $5,868) in 2020. It took them around eight months to convert it into a campervan, at a cost of around £5,500 ($7,170). The couple, who are both teachers, got engaged during their first trip and plan to incorporate their van, the Happy Hoppa, into their wedding.

When their plans to travel around Europe by train fell through due to the pandemic, Dacombe and Hitchcock began searching for alternative ways to see the world together once borders reopened.

While they'd previously discussed the possibility of getting a campervan, they say it was witnessing another couple relaxing in a converted van during a trip to the beach that helped them finally make the decision.

As the UK went into a second lockdown in 2020, Dacombe and Hitchcock drew up a plan for the layout of their dream van on the back of a brown envelope and began the project.

""We've still got the envelope now,"" says Hitchcock.

They originally setting themselves a budget of £8,000 (around $10,430) but realized they were likely to go over when they began looking into vans, and found a minibus for about $5,868 that they couldn't resist.

""I remember just staring at the back of this bus, thinking 'oh gosh. What have we done?"" admits Hitchcock.

Dacombe and Hitchcock worked tirelessly on the bus in order to get it into shape. Matt & Gem

The couple say they didn't really plan out the build in much detail before beginning, but would take on something new week by week and reach out to other van lifers for advice.

Determined to keep costs down, they completed the entire renovation using just a jigsaw, a drill, a hand saw, a spirit measure, a screwdriver, a sander and a workbench.

""We tried to go as minimal as possible,"" says Dacombe. ""We pretty much built the whole van on just wooden battens and plywood. Even the doors of the cabinets and all our drawers.

""They all came from plywood. We kept it cheap, but we've got good quality products.""

Not only has this method saved them money, it's also helped to keep the weight of the van down.

The maximum weight restrictions for motorhomes and campervans within the UK and Europe tends to be 3.5 tons. If a vehicle is over the legal weight limit, owners are required to upgrade their driving license or they could face fines.

While Dacombe and Hitchcock did the majority of the work themselves, the couple used a specialist company for their electrical system.

""Going into it, I was quite confident with the appearance of converting a van,"" says Dacombe. ""But electricity was another ballgame. You don't want to get that wrong.""

They also brought in professionals to help remove some metal flooring that had been glued to the floor of the van.

In order to keep costs down, they built most of the inside furniture and compartments from plywood. Matt & Gem

Once they'd cladded the walls and the ceiling of the van, built a bed frame and cut their mattress to size, the next big task was building an L-shaped kitchen with a sink in the remaining space, and constructing their sofa areas.

""That's when it got really exciting,"" says Hitchcock. ""Because we could actually see what we'd planned on the brown envelope.""

The conversion took eight months in total. Hitchcock says she was very particular about how she wanted the van to look and would come up with new ideas at the last minute.

""I wanted it to be very beachy, very wooden and fresh,"" she says. ""We really wanted to maximize all of the windows on the bus.""

A few days before they were due to leave on their first trip in the van, Hitchcock decided they needed a wine rack for their fridge.

While this proved to be a tricky task, Dacombe created one that could fit inside by cutting a double wine rack in half, and both say it has come in extremely handy.

""Gemma's the interior designer and I'm the laborer,"" he admits. ""But I don't think we'd have been able to do it without both of us chipping in on both sides.""

Dacombe bought an engagement ring shortly before they set off, and was waiting for the right moment to propose.

He ended up popping the question on the beach later that same evening after they'd parked up at Durdle Door in Dorset, a coastal beauty spot in southwest England, and were watching the sunset together.

""I had the ring, I had asked Gem's mum and dad for permission and I knew I would be doing it during our travels,"" says Dacombe.

""But the first evening, with the surroundings of Durdle Door, the sunset, the feeling of what we had just achieved together... It was the perfect moment.""

After putting so much time and energy into creating their van, the couple, who also detail their adventures in the van on their Instagram account , are hugely proud of it, and say they often get compliments from onlookers.

""We'll be parked up and sitting on the bed having a glass of wine or whatever and people are constantly coming to ask if they can have a look inside,"" says Hitchcock.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/travelers-who-converted-campervans/index.html

279,Why Europe's fight against the pandemic is about to get much more dangerous,"Paris (CNN) ""Despite months of persuasion, despite intensive media campaigns, despite discussions in various media we have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated."" Those were the words of former Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg last month as he announced the first nationwide vaccine mandate in Europe.

Others have made vaccines mandatory for parts of the population and imposed restrictions that increasingly explicitly target the unvaccinated, as Europe battles the twin challenges of sharply rising Covid figures and plateauing vaccination rates.

Nearly one year into the EU's vaccination campaign, and with around one in three Europeans still unvaccinated, it is not so much hesitancy that European governments are now facing as outright opposition, with the danger that as governments get tougher so too will popular anger towards them.

The crucial question of trust

Only 19% of Europeans include their government among their most trusted sources of reliable information on Covid-19 vaccines, according to a survey conducted in May 2021 by the European Barometer, a collection of cross-country public opinion surveys conducted regularly on behalf of the EU's institutions.

Even before the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy in Europe was strongly correlated to a populist distrust of mainstream parties and governments.

One study published in the European Journal of Public Health in 2019 found ""a highly significant positive association between the percentage of people in a country who voted for populist parties and the percentage who believe that vaccines are not important and not effective.""

What the pandemic has provided is a Europe-wide real-time test of that correlation. Nearly two years in and with most countries having exhausted what means they had of encouraging people to get vaccinated, the map of those who remain unvaccinated shows that where there is distrust in government and traditional political parties -- as measured by the strength of populist movements -- many people have yet to get vaccinated.

Essentially, people who trust institutions need no convincing in the face of a pandemic; people who don't are unlikely to be influenced at all.

Difficulties with vaccine rollouts and in reaching more remote and elderly rural populations are also to blame in Eastern Europe, but in some of the countries where vaccine take-up has been lowest, populist parties are either in power or strong electorally.

Further west, lower vaccination rates are also to be found in countries and regions with either popular or voluble populist or extremist movements, as in Germany, Austria and Northern Italy.

In a paper published by the journal Psychological Medicine in October, Michele Roccato and Silvia Russo from the University of Turin argue that their study shows ""people with a populist orientation tend to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine, in line with previous research showing that vaccine refusal is often politicized, but that its politicization is not limited to the traditional left-right cleavage.""

A new common enemy

Sophie Tissier, who organizes protests against Covid-19 restrictions and vaccines in France, says that these protests have created a new political force that is radical but goes beyond party political lines.

She says her group seeks to ""create a citizens' opposition which is beyond electoral considerations and much more like a watchdog that sits outside the world of politics to be able to tell it: 'Look here, you are no longer protecting our rights, you are no longer protecting our rights under the law.'""

Demonstrators march during a protest against coronavirus measures in Brussels, Belgium, on December 5, 2021.

In August, more than 230,000 people took to the streets across the country in one day after France became one of the first European countries to announce the use of relatively strict vaccine passes.

""It really set things alight because people realized that life as it was, was coming to an end,"" she said. ""People would no longer be free, or able to go out as they did.""

Since then, protests have tapered off in France, partly because no mainstream party has been openly encouraging its supporters to join them. France's vaccine rates are among the highest in Europe, suggesting that even in countries where there is strong vaccine hesitancy -- as there was in France even before the pandemic -- far-right or populist parties' stance on the vaccine can have an impact.

Elsewhere in Europe, such groups are clearly fanning the anti-vaccination flames. In Austria, several protests planned since the government announced its nationwide vaccine mandate last month have been planned by the far-right Freedom Party.

The mandate is due to come into force in February 2022.

Even as he announced the move, Schallenberg accused the Freedom Party of being responsible for the country's low vaccination rates and of having stirred up vaccine hesitancy.

""We have too many political forces in this country that are fighting against [vaccination] vehemently, massively and publicly. That is irresponsible,"" Schallenberg said , adding: ""Incited by these radical opponents of vaccination, by specious fake news, unfortunately too many of us have not been vaccinated. The consequence is overcrowded intensive care units and enormous human suffering.""

In other European countries, populist parties have also jumped on the bandwagon.

And the divide in opinion over pandemic measures is no longer about extreme left and extreme right, said French political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, but ""between the mainstream and the periphery.""

""It's much more about the extreme,"" Camus said. ""The most extreme fringe groups taking advantage of the pandemic to say: 'This virus is fake, there is no pandemic and you are being tricked by your governments. It's a worldwide conspiracy of your national governments. They are using the pandemic to infringe on your individual rights and using vaccination passes to have your personal data,' and so on.""

In parts of Eastern Europe, but also in and around Germany -- from Northern Italy to the Netherlands and Austria -- parties which once focused on immigration or Europe have been tapping into the widespread anger of those opposed to vaccines and Covid-19 restrictions, shifting their attention to an issue far more likely to appeal to the apolitical and to cut across traditional party political lines.

Their new enemy is far more federating: The Covid-19 measures and vaccination campaigns that they say threaten their freedom.

Vaccine mandates

The World Health Organization has cautioned against vaccine mandates , because of their potential impact on public confidence and public trust. Dr Hans Kluge, WHO's Europe Director, said they should be used as ""an absolute last resort , and only applicable when all other feasible options to improve vaccine uptake have been exhausted.""

In a part of the world where the fight against the pandemic has already been hampered by vaccine hesitancy, such mandates could fuel more resistance.

""The worry is that anti-vaxxers could come to hold even more extreme positions,"" said Russo, of the University of Turin. ""That's one risk. But we should also consider that where vaccines become mandatory, there will need to be controls and that could further undermine institutional trust. ""

In other words, forced vaccination might push people into vaccination centers but it will also drive some of them to the streets, confirming and further fueling their deeply held suspicion of ""the system.""

The fight against the pandemic may one day come to an end, but the fight against populism in Europe could be just beginning.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/14/europe/europe-covid-vaccines-opposition-populism-intl/index.html
280,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel . Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Most passengers don't want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Texting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

281,"'Hamlet' in the skies? The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX","(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market.

And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir.

Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang.

But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's ""Prince Hamlet"" by local media.

This Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.

Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will.

A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot.

But being the youngest son and the only child of Chang Yung-fa's second wife, Chang Kuo-wei's promotion ignited a family feud. He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members.

A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines.

""He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'""

Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan.

The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.

But according to the team at STARLUX, Chang isn't out for retribution.

""He doesn't think that he is 'Hamlet',"" K.W. Nieh, STARLUX's chief communication officer, tells CNN Travel. ""This has nothing to do with revenge.""

""Because of his passion for aviation, Chang merely wants to build an ideal airline that reflects his style after breaking from the shackles of Evergreen Group. He is building STARLUX to fulfill the expectations of his late father.""

CNN Travel has reached out to EVA Air for comment.

Whether or not Taipei-based STARLUX can outdo the other major players on the island remains to be seen, but it's certainly upped Taiwan's aviation game.

The airline is introducing a new generation of passenger aircraft, including the A321neo and A350-1000, ""both debuting for the first time in Taiwan,"" says Nieh.

Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021. STARLUX signed Taiwan's largest single Airbus purchase agreement, purchasing 17 A350XWB aircraft in March 2019.

Chang himself piloted STARLUX's first A321neo to Taipei from Hamburg last month.

""The fleet will grow to 27 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2030,"" adds Nieh.

The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes.

Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system.

Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.

Local touches abound as well. A unique cabin scent -- with notes of woods, leather and florals -- has been created by Taiwan-grown fragrance brand P.Seven. The airline's crew uniform, which bears themes of retro-futuristic travel in the 40s and 50s, is the product of local designer Sean Yin.

No fare war: STARLUX will charge more than competitors

Aspiring to be the Emirates of Asia, STARLUX vows to provide premium service, too.

At a recent press event, Chang said STARLUX Airlines will not start a fare war. Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors.

""We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,"" adds Nieh. ""We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.

""We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market. We have introduced the most advanced aircraft models with the latest aviation technology and seats. We offer exquisite service items so the fare will be slightly higher than the other airlines.""

According to aviation expert CK Law, senior adviser of the Department of Aviation Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this unique positioning is a clever move for STARLUX.

""Many new airlines have been tapping into the low-cost sector in the market, particularly in this part of the world,"" says Law.

""That's definitely the major trend. There should be reasonable demand for the high-end passenger segment of the market.""

But he expects the new airline will still have an impact on airfares in the long run.

""From the passengers' point of view, there will be new and substantial benefits for them to have new choices and possible new fare reductions in the longer term. There'll be competition for better services on the plane,"" says Law.

Potential cut-throat competition

Taiwan has been enjoying healthy passenger growth numbers as well as flights in recent years.

Boeing has estimated that Taiwan's aviation demand will be stronger than the Northeast Asia region's annual average -- 2% over the next two decades -- as a whole.

But is there enough space to accommodate another major airline?

""A new full-service airline would definitely introduce a lot of new competition to a traditional aviation market like Taiwan,"" says Law.

""Whether the new airline or even the existing airlines can survive because of this will mainly depend on how fast the market will grow and whether the new demand could absorb or balance with the new supply capacity.

""Otherwise, that could be a cut-throat competition and there could be casualties.""

Related content World's longest airline routes

One of the biggest questions is: Can a newcomer carve a spot for itself in the long-haul and transit markets, the two markets STARLUX plans to explore?

""I would expect a good, high load factor being achieved for the short haul tourism markets but the long haul destinations, which have [major competition in Taiwan,] would definitely be more challenging,"" says Law.

""It won't be easy for new airlines to join a reputable alliance, to start with. Without being a member of an alliance, it won't be easy at all to get transit passengers. But it can be a long-term goal,"" says Law.

Nieh, on the other hand, is confident.

""The development of STARLUX doesn't solely rely on the Taiwan market. Taipei has a superior geographical location -- you can reach major Asian cities within five hours"" he says.

""Located in a central position connecting North America, North Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan has the best foundation to develop as an aviation hub. By introducing and building its hardware and software, the aviation industry of Taiwan will hopefully become the transportation hub of Asia, strengthen its transit services and bring a large number of international passengers to Taiwan.""

Nieh points to a recent study by the Taiwan government's National Audit Office, which claims only 10% of the island's inbound travelers are transit passengers.

""Comparing to Hong Kong, Incheon, Shanghai and Tokyo, there is room for market development,"" says Nieh. ""We're very certain about this part.""

The initial rush for ticket sales has been good news for STARLUX.

""Tickets to Macau sold out in six minutes; tickets to Danang sold out in nine and tickets to Penang sold out in 11 minutes,"" Liwen Liu, director of STARLUX's corporate communications division tells CNN.

""All 188 seats on each of the three flights.

""We're very happy about it. We had our expectations but the response has been better than what we expected,"" says Liu.

282,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle.

Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.

While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.

In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.

Greater accessibility

Cityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations — now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters.

The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.""

Courtesy The Copenhagen Metro

Public squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.

""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen.

Building the line was not without its challenges.

Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said.

Technical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.

Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.

""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.""

In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.

Shiny, new rails

The new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

The line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.

The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).

Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.

Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes.

Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level.

Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds.

Bike-friendly

The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen.

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.

While these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.

The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro.

With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.

While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/metro-cityring-copenhagen-denmark/index.html
283,Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"(CNN) — One of the first things you'll notice on entering the Mystery Hotel Budapest is the Aladdin-style magic carpet ""floating"" above the reception desk.

This is the first indication there's much more to this boutique hotel than meets the eye.

Then there's the countless light boxes on the walls displaying animated pictures that change several times a day and the elevator, which is partially hidden by velvet curtains.

Depending on which room you're staying in, you could find yourself lying against a headboard with a version of Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" where the ""girl"" has an iPhone in her hand, or a ""party girl"" interpretation of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" complete with VIP passes to Budapest's Sziget Festival.

And if you happen to book visit the ""secret"" Pythagoras meeting room, you'll have to figure out how to open it yourself (hint -- there's an unassuming box involved).

Located in Budapest's Terézváros district, the Mystery Hotel is arguably one of the most thrilling hotels in the city thanks to the intrigue that lies inside its walls.

It's set inside what was once the main headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons, providing the inspiration for its enigmatic theme, along with movies such as ""The Da Vinci Code.""

While it lacks the dramatic city views and central location of some of Budapest more famous hotels, the property, which opened in May 2019, is fast becoming one of the most Instagram-friendly places to stay in Budapest.

This is certainly no accident. In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had ""likes"" in mind when conceptualizing the property.

""Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,"" Varró tells CNN Travel. ""Around 20 years ago, people wanted to go to big names because they felt safe with them.

""Now the most important thing is to stand out. Everyone is looking for something special. Social media is vital.

""When a guest sees something amazing and takes a picture, it can be shared with the rest of the world in seconds.""

Viktória Berényi, director of business development at the Mystery Hotel, says social media has helped to bring in a large number of bookings.

""First impressions are everything,"" says Berényi. ""There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first.

""But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.""

One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.

Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.

Freemasonry past

The grand staircase is among the elements preserved from the old building. Courtesy Mystery Hotel Budapest

One of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.

After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital.

It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.

Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.

""After communism, the room was destroyed,"" says Varró. ""The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.

""I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.""

Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.

Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.

At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.

Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.

You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.

Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.

Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.

However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.

""As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,"" she says.

Unique suites

There are three different suite styles, Doric, Ion and Corinthian. The Doric rooms, which overlook the hotel's courtyard and the Secret Garden Spa, hold English Victorian style features and are decorated in various shades of green.

The Ion rooms are based on the upper floors of the hotel and possess a French mansard style, while the Corinthian rooms hold Baroque style furnishings, such as burgundy velvet curtains.

Located on the sixth floor, the Atelier Suite is the most unique suite in the building. Designed to resemble a painter's studio, it holds a marble staircase, brick walls, huge paintings and dozens of rugs. Even the TV stand takes the form of an art easel.

""The original plan was to have this room as a storage area, because it only has two small windows,"" explains Varró.

""When I decided to make it one of the biggest suites, the owner thought I was crazy. But it's been very popular.""

The suite is often requested for private gatherings, with the likes of Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&Gabbana hiring it for private events.

While the Great Hall is a tough act to follow, not to mention rooftop bar the Sky Garden, which provides views of the Royal Palace, the hotel spa is another stand out spot.

There are plenty of beautiful thermal baths to choose from in Budapest, which means any hotel spa here has to be pretty impressive in order to entice visitors.

However, the Secret Garden Day Spa definitely doesn't disappoint.

Situated in the hotel's enclosed courtyard, it has a Baroque garden feel, with dramatic palm trees and a beautiful fountain.

Guests have the option to relax on day beds, slip into the sauna and steam room, or opt for some of the many cosmetic, body treatments and massages on offer.

The lighting in the spa is also fantastic due to its courtyard position, along with an array of crystal chandeliers.

""This was an empty place,"" says Varró. ""I wanted to create something different. I think this [the courtyard] is the perfect place for a spa. Budapest is not a very sunny city, but it's always summer here.""

Its center piece is undoubtedly the magnificent whirlpool, which provides a fantastic view of the facade of the building.

285,How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.

New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.

Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.

Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.

There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?

Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.

With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.

""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.""

Culinary movement

Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine.

Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.

Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.

""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.

""Everything is completely different now.""

Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.

He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.

Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.

""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.

Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""

""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""

""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""

While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.

""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.

""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.""

Modern interpretations

Chef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.

Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.

Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.

""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.

""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""

Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together.

""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""

Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash.

""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.

Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched.

In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.

""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.

Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.

Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,

""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""

Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.

Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.

It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.

Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.

Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.

""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""

""I'm never scared about new things.""

According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.

""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti. ""I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.""

Basic ingredients

Salt is tipped to become the next Budapest restaurant to receive a Michelin star. Courtesy Salt Budapest

Hoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.

It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.

Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.

""We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,"" Toth tells CNN.

""This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.""

The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.

Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.

The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.

""We have a course called greasy bread,"" says Boldizsar. "" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.

""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.""

Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.

""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.

A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.

Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.

""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.

""I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.

""It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.'",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/fine-dining-budapest/index.html
286,Flame Towers: Luxury atop one of the world's tallest hotels,"Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — From traditional souks, mosques and UNESCO World Heritage sites, to futuristic skyscrapers, Baku, capital of Azerbaijan , offers an eclectic mix of old and new.

Among the most startling additions to the modern skyline are the Flame Towers, a trio of sky-high structures that resemble tongues of fire reaching high over the Caspian Sea.

Designed by US architecture firm HOK, and with Tower 1 standing at 182 meters, they're the tallest buildings in Azerbaijan.

And visitors can stay in them -- one building's residential, one is for office use, while the third, the 165-meter-tall Fairmont Baku, is a contemporary five-star hotel.

Related content The mud volcano capital of the world

Enter the flame

The towers can be seen from almost anywhere in the city, but night is when they truly come alive. Orange, red and pink LED lights dance across the towers like burning flames.

For some in Baku, they're now a symbol of home.

""You can see Flame Towers as you fly into the airport, lit up with multicolored lights and shining the way,"" fashion designer and media professional Nina Zandnia tells CNN Travel. ""They're the sign that lets everybody know they've reached Azerbaijan.""

So what's it like to stay in one of the country's most familiar landmarks? It's certainly no ordinary hotel.

The bold, sometimes bombastic statements begin with the dramatic exterior and keep going all the way inside.

The venue's seven-story lobby is dominated by an extravagant chandelier, using five kilometers of strands, decorated with 840 lights and more than 600,000 crystal beads, and weighing a whopping two metric tons.

Taking pride of place below is a limited edition black and red Fazioli, one of the most expensive pianos in the world. The M Liminal , designed by NYT Line and Philippe Gendre, was purportedly accompanied Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimov in the performance that took Azerbaijan to victory in the 2011 edition of the annual Eurovision song contest.

Guests shouldn't expect to hear it used in any casual jam sessions, it's now only played by top pianists on special occasions.

Come evening, the Flame Towers put on a light show enjoyed across the city. Courtesy Fairmont Baku

Sea views

The tower is home to more than 300 rooms, suites and serviced apartments, that range in price from $170 to upwards of $5,000 a night.

Even the most basic offer ceiling-to-floor windows and sumptuously large double beds. The décor is a contemporary luxury mix, with plush carpets and modern furniture. Spacious and comfortable, each room in the hotel either looks out over the city or across the bay into the sea.

Crisp and glamorous as it is, it does have an edge of corporate blandness that falls short of the regal vibes felt, for example, in the nearby Four Seasons.

A typical one-bedroom suite on the 17th floor offers views of the Caspian Sea and, if eligible, access to the Fairmont Gold lounge on the 19th floor, which comes with a private check-in area and concierge service.

The super-fast elevator to the 17th opens onto a spectacular landing with views across the bay. Once inside the suite, there's a lobby area, are more jaw-dropping views, an office-slash-dining room, with wooden desk and a four-seater dining table.

Then there's a generous, richly carpeted lounge with an oversized sofa and jazzy signature chair. The separate bedroom has a huge king-sized bed. There's an enormous walk-in closet stacked with hangers, drawers and laundry essentials that leads into a large bathroom complete with bath and shower room.

In both of the suite's two bathrooms, there are bespoke toiletries -- yes, your name is printed on the shampoo, moisturizer and conditioner bottle. It's a souvenir just asking to be taken home.

The royal suite

Nice touches, but does the hotel have celeb appeal? Yes, says, Zumrud Ismayilova, the hotel's PR and marketing manager. Names are not named, but the list apparently includes leaders, royals and celebrities.

""We have had many VIP guests stay at the hotel, but we would never disclose who they are,"" she tells CNN Travel. ""When our guests come to stay with us, they expect privacy and confidentiality and that is exactly what we give them.""

Positioned at the very tip of the flame, the Royal Suite offers panoramic views of both city and sea. There are two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms, a lounge, private dining room, study, a guest bathroom, a kitchen and a grand hallway with chandelier -- 375 square meters (4,036 square feet) of living space in total.

""The VIP or family will stay in the suite, but the rest of their party tends to take over the entire floor. We have additional rooms for security and staff, and a suite for extra family members,"" explains Ismayilova.

There's an open-plan living area, private study, a dining room fit for for 12 or more guests and a fully equipped kitchen (for the servants, of course). But the main attraction is the grand en suite bathroom with a vast oyster-shaped bath complete with window view over the bay.

Wellness

The hotels amenities are a mixed bag. There's an elegant spa spread over two floors of the hotel with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, hammam and spaces to unwind. There's also a fully equipped gym.

The beautifully designed Sky Garden allows guests the luxury of relaxing on the sundeck or taking advantage of the poolside sauna while looking out at the sea. There's an S-shaped rooftop pool and outdoor bar, which look better from a distance than close up.

It's best visited come evening. When the sun's up, the towers reflect the sun and magnify its heat, making this area a frying pan.

Food and entertainment

As you'd hope from a fancy hotel inside one of the country's biggest landmarks, the main Le Bistro restaurant offers an array of local Azerbaijani wines and delicacies. The Balcon café offers specialty teas and cakes, as well as sushi in the afternoons.

There's also the Nur lounge which is a funky setting serving cocktails and snacks, and is a good pre-drinks site to soak in the atmosphere before moving onto the hotel's Jazz Club, a local institution.

""We always recommend people to check out the Jazz Club after 9 p.m., because that's when it really gets going. It's very popular with both the hotel guests and the locals, and we always offer something new to keep people entertained,"" Ismayilova says.

There are two things that most hotels are unable to provide -- a shopping mall and cinema. Fairmont Flame Towers offers both.

Park Cinema provides guests (and members of the public) with six screens, including IMAX, showing the latest Arabic, English and Russian language films.

Next door is the Flame Towers Shopping Mall, due for completion in early 2020. Luxury brands, high street names, cafes and restaurants are all set to take up residency.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/fairmont-baku-flame-towers-azerbaijan/index.html
287,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents.

There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan

The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians.

In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life.

The Museum of Longevity

The two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants.

It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age.

And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade.

Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop.

The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define ""centenarian"" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old.

However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.

Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping.

Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800.

The tale of the 168-year-old man

Is this the world's oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla Rzayeva

Lerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168.

The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived.

Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born.

Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.

Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, ""Dear Grandpa.""

This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt.

'Stillness of the mind'

When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran , but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father).

Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as ""vulnerable"" by UNESCO.

She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, ""15.""

""Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,"" the museum guide says. ""They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.""

Good nutrition and natural remedies

Halima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla Rzayeva

Qambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. ""I get up as soon as my eyes open,"" she says.

She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back.

Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance.

Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea.

It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik.

""The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,"" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication.

Generations living side by side

Beyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families.

Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes.

At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them.

Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.

'Whatever God gives'

Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva

""He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,"" his son says.

In terms of food, he eats ""whatever God gives"" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol.

Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body.

Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity.

The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor.

2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain , found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer

The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/long-life-lerik-azerbaijan-wellness/index.html
288,Eternal flame: How Azerbaijan became the 'Land of Fire',"Editor's Note — Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — ""This fire has burned 4,000 years and never stopped,"" says Aliyeva Rahila. ""Even the rain coming here, snow, wind -- it never stops burning.""

Ahead, tall flames dance restlessly across a 10-meter stretch of hillside, making a hot day even hotter.

This is Yanar Dag -- meaning ""burning mountainside"" -- on Azerbaijan 's Absheron Peninsula, where Rahila works as a tour guide.

A side effect of the country's plentiful natural gas reserves, which sometimes leak to the surface, Yanar Dag is one of several spontaneously occurring fires to have fascinated and frightened travelers to Azerbaijan over the millennia.

Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote of the mysterious phenomena when he passed through the country in the 13th century. Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would trave l to other lands.

It's why the country earned the moniker the ""land of fire.""

Ancient religion

Such fires were once plentiful in Azerbaijan, but because they led to a reduction of gas pressure underground, interfering with commercial gas extraction, most have been snuffed out.

Yanar Dag is one of the few remaining examples, and perhaps the most impressive.

At one time they played a key role in the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which was founded in Iran and flourished in Azerbaijan in the first millennium BCE.

l e v a r t

For Zoroastrians, fire is a link between humans and the supernatural world, and a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom can be gained. It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.

Today, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.

The experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila.

Despite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it. The center offers only a small cafe and there's not much else in the area.

Ateshgah Fire Temple

For a deeper insight into Azerbaijan's history of fire worship, visitors should head east of Baku to Ateshgah Fire Temple.

""Since ancient times, they think that [their] god is here,"" says our guide, as we enter the pentagonal complex which was built in the 17th and 18th century by Indian settlers in Baku.

Fire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for ""home of fire"" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.

A natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.

The temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.

Merchants and ascetics

Built like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.

These were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.

The temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/yanar-dag-azerbaijan-land-of-fire/index.html
289,"Beijing shuts Universal Studios, bans restaurant dining in major escalation of Covid restrictions","(CNN) Beijing has banned all restaurant dining, shut down Universal Studios and ordered residents to provide proof of a negative Covid test to enter public venues in a major escalation of restrictions as a five-day holiday gets underway.

The Labor Day holiday, which started on Saturday this year, has traditionally been a busy time for mass travel and gatherings in China. But there is little holiday spirit this year, as the Chinese government doubles down on its zero-Covid policy to fight the country's worst outbreak since Wuhan.

Many local governments have ordered residents not to leave their cities unless absolutely necessary and have imposed lengthy quarantine requirements for people coming from areas where Covid caseshave been reported. The Chinese Transport Ministry expects 100 million journeys to be made over the holiday -- a 62 percent plunge from last year.

As a month-long lockdown continues in the financial hub of Shanghai, the Chinese capitalof Beijingis grappling with a new Omicron outbreak that has put officials and residents on edge.

Many Beijing residents have rushed to stock up on food and daily necessities over the past week, fearing a Shanghai-style lockdown could cause shortages.

Beijing authorities have already rolled out several rounds of mass testing, locked down dozens of residential communities and suspended schools, but restrictions were tightened further at the start of the holiday.

On Saturday, Beijing officials announced that dining-in services at restaurants would be suspended during the holiday period.

After the holiday, workers and students will be required to present a negative Covid test -- taken within the previous 48 hours -- to return to work or school. And starting from May 5, residents must provide a negative Covid test -- taken within the previous seven days -- to enter all public venues, including taking public transport. All residents are required to take a Covid test at least once a week, according to officials.

On Sunday, Universal Beijing Resort said its Universal Studios theme park and CityWalk shopping zone would be closed immediately after receiving ""guidance"" from disease control authorities. It did not say when the park would reopen.

Beijing reported 59 local infections on Sunday, the highest number of daily cases in its current outbreak. The city has reported more than 300 cases since April 20.

Meanwhile, in Shanghai, officials said Sunday that community transmission in the city had been ""effectively controlled,"" following more than a month of stringent lockdown that confined most of its 25 million residents to their homes.

Shanghai reported 7,872 local cases Sunday, continuing a general downward trend since April 13, officials said at a news conference. The city also reported 38 new deaths, bringing the total death toll of the current outbreak to 422.

290,China grapples with political challenges as Covid death toll mounts,"Hong Kong (CNN) For two years, China's Communist Party has enforced a costly regime of strict border quarantines, snap lockdowns, and mass digital tracking in the service of a single goal: Zero Covid cases.

And Beijing points to the past successes of this strategy -- including only two reported Covid-related deaths for all of 2021 -- to burnish its claims of superiority over Western governments.

""No effort should be spared to attend every case, save every patient, and truly respect the value and dignity of every human life,"" Chinese leader Xi Jinping -- who has explicitly reiterated his support for the ""zero-Covid"" policy in recent weeks -- said at a global health summit last year.

Now, that picture is changing, as for the first time in nearly two years China's Covid death toll is rising on a daily basis, amid an outbreak in Shanghai that has seen the city of 25 million placed under a seemingly unending, stringent lockdown

Since April 17 , city officials have reported 238 Covid-related deaths -- largely elderly people, all of whom, authorities say, died of underlying conditions in an outbreak that has spread to more than 500,000 people since March 1.

The deaths mark a new phase of loss for China as well as a high-risk political challenge.

Reporting death figures is ""something of a two-edged sword for the authorities,"" according to health security expert Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at City University of Hong Kong.

""If the numbers are too low, not only is there a problem of trust, but also it will make the quarantine restrictions seem excessive. If the numbers are too high, then the lockdowns are justified but the authorities have failed to contain the virus.""

To date, government officials have prioritized the suppression of the virus over all else, even as public resentment and economic risks grow under blunt lockdown restrictions.

So far, there's no sign of a change in policy, with Beijing instead ""doubling down on its messaging of stopping the virus,"" even as outbreaks spread, according to Thomas.

And as the zero-Covid policy continues to be explicitly linked to Chinese leader Xi, it's clear ""this line is going to be held for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

By the numbers

As the number of deaths and severe Covid cases has risen in Shanghai in recent days, city health officials have spoken with increasing urgency about further strengthening critical care response and upping vaccination in the elderly -- though lockdowns and mass testing appear to have taken priority over vaccination so far.

""We need to coordinate the city's medical resources, increase critical medical teams ... reduce the proportion of severe patients ... and try our best to reduce the fatality rate,"" Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Health Commission, said Sunday.

""Eligible elderly people should be vaccinated as soon as possible,"" he said.

Shanghai officials earlier this month said 62% of those over 60 are vaccinated in Shanghai, with 38% boosted, but that number fell to just 15% fully vaccinated for the most vulnerable over-80 age group, according to state media. Of the 238 deaths in recent days, only 13 have been vaccinated, authorities said on Wednesday, without specifying details regarding full vaccination or booster shots.

Now, as authorities have upheld expectations that death rates in the country will remain low, they have no choice but to rely on lockdowns to protect the vulnerable.

But already, an unknown number of fatalities appear to be linked to stringent controls in the city, as restrictions have thrown up challenges in access to medical care -- a disruption city officials have repeatedly vowed to address.

One fear has been that Shanghai could see a similar crisis to that of Hong Kong, where an outbreak that began at the start of the year pushed the city's fatality rate to among the highest worldwide since the pandemic began.

Hong Kong, too, faced low vaccination rates within a large elderly population, with just 48% of people aged 70 or older fully vaccinated as of early March, and only 25% of residents aged 80 or over vaccinated at the start of this year.

Counting cases

But the Hong Kong comparison also raises questions of how Shanghai has managed to keep its death rates so low.

Hong Kong reported more than 9,000 Covid-19 deaths out of 1.19 million total cases since January this year.

By that rate, Shanghai should have seen as many as 700 deaths for every 100,000 cases, according to infectious diseases physician Peter Collignon, also a professor at the Australian National University Medical School.

Workers disinfect a residential community during the Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai.

Experts have also pointed to a lack of transparency around the criteria used by Chinese officials to classify a Covid-19 death.

""If there is no black-and-white definition for Covid deaths or Covid-related deaths or how these deaths should be reported then everything is just up to that expert panel to decide,"" said Jin Dongyan, a professor at University of Hong Kong's School of Biomedical Sciences. ""That's the reality.""

Some of these mirror concerns over whether there was a full accounting of infections and deaths during China's initial 2020 outbreak in Wuhan, which overwhelmed hospitals -- though China has defended its transparency throughout the pandemic.

China's Foreign Ministry said in a 2020 statement: ""China calculated and reported its confirmed cases and fatalities based on facts ... the relatively low number of confirmed cases and deaths can be attributed to the comprehensive and strict measures taken by the Chinese government.""

But experts also warn that it's difficult to draw comparisons between places with different testing and disease control strategies, social factors and demographics.

For example, Shanghai's intensive testing has picked up hundreds of thousands of asymptomatic cases, some of which may have been missed in case counts in other places, potentially skewing comparisons.

Bureaucratic processes and the time it takes for positive cases to succumb to the disease can also cause reported deaths to lag, with some experts suggesting the worst in Shanghai may be yet to come.

Meanwhile, understanding the overall toll -- not only of the virus -- but of the lockdowns rolled out across Shanghai and other cities is critical to evaluating the true cost of China's control measures, experts say.

Xi Chen, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the long-term fallout from the Shanghai lockdown, including missed cancer screenings or mental health strain, will take time -- and data -- to become clear, and even then may be hard to measure.

""We will often look at two kinds of negative shock,"" he said of the fallout past the initial burden of death. ""One, for those people who died eventually, and, the other, those who survived but live with trauma attached to them.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/china/shanghai-deaths-covid-19-underreporting-questions-intl-mic-hnk/index.html
291,Boeing's problems in China go far beyond the latest grounding,"New York (CNN Business) Another Boeing plane has been grounded after a fatal crash, this time in China . That may be the least of the company's problems in a crucial market.

The decision to ground the Boeing model 737-800 was made by China Eastern Airlines, which operated the jet that crashed March 21, killing all 132 on board. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined, and the grounding could be lifted soon if it turns out the cause was not mechanical.

But Boeing has plenty of other troubles in China, the world's largest aviation market. It is on the verge of being virtually shut out of the region as trade tensions between the United States and China have basically halted Boeing sales in the country for the last four years. The company has not announced any sales to a Chinese passenger airline since November 2017. Only six months ago, Boeing projected the Chinese market would be worth $1.5 trillion in commercial aircraft purchases over the next 20 years.

It takes a long time to build and deliver planes after they're ordered, and Boeing continued to deliver jets to China's airlines and leasing companies in 2018 and early 2019. But only 40 of them have been delivered since March 2019. That's when aviation authorities around the globe grounded Boeing's bestselling jet, the 737 Max, after two fatal crashes were found to have been caused by a design flaw. That grounding stretched on for 20 months

The US Federal Aviation Administration cleared the plane to carry passengers again in November 2020, with most other countries' aviation authorities following close behind. Airlines that owned the 737 Max were soon flying the plane again.

But not in China, where the aviation regulator — one of the first to ground the Max after the second accident — waited another year to clear the plane to fly. Chinese airlines that own the planes still have not returned them to service.

""We would now expect further delays to Chinese reinstatement of the 737 Max while this accident is investigated, at least until a likely cause is identified,"" said a note this week from Melius Research.

Key market

China would be a devastating blow to Boeing BA Losing a market as important asChina would be a devastating blow to, which has been hit by one problem after another over the last three years, starting with the 737 Max crashes and then the pandemic , which all but obliterated demand for flying and devastated the finances of its airline customers. More recently, there have been issues with its latest model, the 787 Dreamliner , halting deliveries.

In 2017 and 2018 China accounted for more than 20% of Boeing's global deliveries, but since the start of 2020 the percentage has dropped to below 5%. (Boeing gets most of its revenue when a plane is delivered.)

Some experts believe Boeing has reached agreements to sell some planes to Chinese airlines in the last four years, either through a leasing company or via sales in which the name of the buyer is not made public. But no aircraft orders are official without approval from the Chinese government, which views plane sales as leverage in its negotiations with the United States on overall trade issues, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in October, ""We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences.""

The longer the current grounding drags on, the more Boeing is at serious risk of losing out on the Chinese market, analysts say.

Airbus EADSF Typically, an airline is reluctant to switch between aircraft manufacturers because such a pivotal change increases the cost of pilot training and makes spare parts more costly. If Chinese customers with Boeing planes in their fleets were to start buying jets from rival, it would be a long-term shift not easily reversed, and one made by the Chinese government rather than the airlines.

""Boeing has its fans over there. But a political mandate in China is a political mandate,"" Aboulafia said.

He and other experts expect Boeing will eventually get back some sales and deliveries in China, but at a much lower number than it was counting on just a few years ago.

China ""can get some planes they need from Airbus, but they can't get all their planes from Airbus,"" said Ronald Epstein, aerospace analyst with Bank of America. Aboulafia describes the relationship between China and Boeing as a ""bad marriage with no possibility of divorce.""

The only good news for Boeing is China's aviation sector is not as important as it appeared it would be a decade ago, when experts were projecting the market would account for 30% of all global commercial jet purchases. China's aviation industry was slowing even before the pandemic, Aboulafia said, from a 12.2% growth rate in 2018's fourth quarter to 5.3% a year later, just before the outbreak of Covid came to light.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/business/boeing-china-problems/index.html
292,"Why this Chinese tea costs more than $184,000 per kilogram","Hong Kong (CNN) — A sumptuous three-course afternoon tea at Glassbelly Tea Lab , a fine-dining restaurant in Hong Kong, has just begun.

But neither the abalone nor the A4 Wagyu ribeye are the stars of the show.

It's the eight glasses of tea that lure patrons to this dark, wood-paneled space in the city's busy Causeway Bay neighborhood.

On the left, three shot glasses contain three different varieties of hot tea: plum-scented raw Puerh tea, Gold Needle Dian Hong (a relatively new black tea from Yunnan) and a peat-scented Rougui -- a type of oolong rock tea from the Wuyi Mountains in China's Fujian Province.

On the right, we have ice drip Full Blossom Rougui tea, served in five Riedel glasses.

""Please have a sniff,"" says the server. ""With the cognac glass, you can get more of the fruit smell. With the Burgundy glass, you pick up more floral flavors.""

It's an unusual and modern way of sampling tea. But I'm here on a mission -- to find out why just a few handfuls of some types of Chinese tea leaves cost thousands of dollars.

Glassbelly specializes in oolong rock tea from Wuyi, which is one of the priciest tea varieties on the planet. It's a specific kind of oolong tea that grows on rocks on eastern China's Wuyi Mountains -- hence the name, ""rock tea.""

Famous rock tea varieties from this area include Rougui, Da Hong Pao and Shui Xian -- which translates to Cinnamon, Big Red Robe and Narcissus, respectively.

Glassbelly's most prized item is the Niu Lan Keng Rougui, a rare variety of Rougui tea from a valley brook of the same name in the Wuyi Mountains.

The retail price? HKD36,000 ($4,560) for 25 grams, or $184,615 for a kilogram, at the time of writing. Enjoying one brew of the tea at the restaurant costs HKD28,000 ($3,577).

To put this into context, a small 150-200 ml pot of tea is usually made with about five grams of tea leaves.

Tea auctions

Rare teas have long been commanding sky-high prices in China. This isn't a new trend.

In 2002, 20 grams of Da Hong Pao -- also a Wuyi Mountain tea, once reserved for the emperor's lips only -- was auctioned for RMB180,000 ($28,000) in Guangzhou.

In 2009, a 100-gram Taiping Houkui (green tea from Anhui) was auctioned for RMB200,000 ($31,300) in Jinan.

More recently, in December 2021, Sotheby's Hong Kong launched its first-ever tea auction, focusing on vintage Puerh tea. A 330-gram tea cake (compressed tea leaves in a cake form) sold for HKD562,500 ($72,150).

Initially, I set out solely to find out why these teas continue to come with such high price tags. But during my research I discovered just how wonderful, secretive and complex the Chinese tea world really is -- and met some new players on the scene who are making bold moves to shake things up.

Making sense of Chinese tea

First, let's start with the basics. There are six main types of Chinese tea: green, white, yellow, oolong, black tea and dark tea.

Each of them is categorized by how the leaves are processed and how long they are fermented. (Green tea is unfermented while dark tea is double fermented.)

Under each category, there are different varieties of teas named for a number of reasons. It could be the location it was harvested. Puerh tea, for example, can only come from certain places in Yunnan.

The leaves are important as well. Lapsang Souchong uses the entire tea leaf while Jin Jun Mei uses only the buds of the leaves.

Glassbelly says that boiling water in a silver pot helps ionize it, making the tea silkier. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

""To understand why some teas are expensive, first, you have to understand what a good tea is,"" explains Wing Yeung, founder of Glassbelly.

This a surprisingly challenging question to answer in spite of the fact tea is one of the most popular beverages in the world.

""A major problem with Chinese tea is that there is no subjective answer to what good tea is. There are many sentimental stories and artistic elements when it comes to selling tea, but so little about the actual flavors of the tea,"" says Yeung, who has worked in the wine industry as well, specializing in Burgundy.

""If you look at wine and coffee, both are plant-derived beverages that have been doing so much better than Chinese tea in the commercial market.""

Lack of a widely recognized system

The lack of a well-recognized standardization system contributes to the pricing confusion.

Compared to wine or coffee, the market is less transparent, making it harder for consumers to know how much a particular type of tea should cost and why.

Yeung claims that her team has poured HKD40 million (around $5 million) worth of tea in pursuit of finding an answer to that question in the last decade, leading them to open Glassbelly in 2021.

The name Glassbelly was inspired by an ancient Chinese semi-mythological character, Shennong (the Divine Farmer).

According to legend, Shennong had a translucent belly. To help the world test the usage and toxicity of vegetation, Shennong would sample every herb he came across and record how it changed in his body, including tea.

Yeung hopes that her Glassbelly restaurant will help shine some clarity on the market, thanks to its modern and scientific approach to tea.

""The tea industry may have changed but the selling technique was stuck like it was 1,000 years ago. There were a lot of hushed business talks and secret deals,"" says Yeung.

Her comments ring true. Several years ago, I took a taxi ride in the city of Wuyi at night. The driver, knowing I was a tourist, slowed down his car to around 20 kilometers per hour, giving him more time to attempt to convince me he had some secret connections who would help me score some Da Hong Pao tea at a good price.

He was just one of several people who tried to sell me tea on that trip.

""Everyone in Wuyi would try to sell you the 'authentic Da Hong Pao' but there are only six mother Da Hong Pao trees -- and they aren't for sale. Authentic Da Hong Pao bred solely from the original trees is also very limited. So it's very hard to find out whether a tea is what the seller claims it is,"" says Yeung.

""We've had sums of money spent on exclusive 'high-end' tea leaves that turned out to be horrible. We learned along the way.""

The flavor wheel

Glassbelly's flavor wheel. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

After a decade of traveling between Hong Kong and mainland China -- mostly to Wuyi Mountain -- Yeung has accumulated thousands of tasting notes to develop Glassbelly's version of a flavor wheel for Chinese tea.

""Wuyi tea is the Burgundy of tea, with so much complexity. It is what the industry calls a 'raw tea' (not fully fermented) so it keeps changing in your glass as well as in your mouth,"" says Yeung.

Rock teas contain over a dozen types of flavor profiles but there are a few your taste buds should be looking for -- citrus, sandalwood and cinnamon.

One Glassbelly workshop invites patrons to compare raw and aged Puerh tea, which is highly prized among tea connoisseurs.

""Raw Puerh tea smells like plum. Aged Puerh tea often comes with the smell of camphor mothballs and old newspaper, which some would say is normal. But if you sample it objectively by taste, your body will naturally repel these smells. I think it is a good sign that it isn't a good tea, like what marketers have been claiming,"" says Yeung.

""It's the smell of a Puerh tea aged in an unnatural way -- by adding humidity to speed up its aging process. It is an accepted practice in the industry but doesn't mean it is good.""

A post on the restaurant's Instagram page says drinking aged Puerh is a "" slow suicide .""

This contrasts the many long-held beliefs in the market that aged Puerh is mild on one's body, while raw Puerh is shunned as too ""cold"" and harmful to one's stomach, according to traditional Chinese medicinal wisdom.

The untold truth

Puerh tea is another highly prized Chinese tea in the market. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

Glassbelly's contrarian views have raised a few eyebrows in the industry.

But, Yeung says, ""truth is always controversial. Controversy makes people reflect and think. Cultural progress usually comes after controversy.""

Wanting to dig more into Glassbelly's claims, I approached respected Puerh tea collector, Raymond Ray.

""I totally admire their outspokenness. So gutsy,"" gasps Ray. ""They actually said something not many in the industry are willing to say.

""But I'd say, good raw Puerh tastes like more than just plum. And not all aged Puerh is bad -- only those that aren't aged in a natural way, which is quite common."".

The story behind Ray's rise in the Hong Kong tea industry has made him a bit of a legend. About a decade ago, he fell sick from a spine disease, leaving him temporarily immobile.

A long-time wine lover, Raymond remembers taking his first sip of a good rock tea.

""It was like my tongue was coming back to life again. I now had something to live for,"" recalls Ray. With a sore back and weak legs, he traveled around Yunnan in search of the best Puerh tea.

""Some historians have confirmed that Yunnan is the origin of tea,"" says Ray. ""I would sit in a car for a four-hour rugged journey to the mountains, then walked with a cane with my bad back.""

That's where he got acquainted with the area's many small Puerh farms.

""You know, really good tea comes from old trees. When it can grow organically with roots big and strong enough that they don't need any chemicals and fertilizers. Farmers will have to climb up the tree to handpick these leaves,"" says Ray.

Raymond Ray, founder of Yuencha Land, says that drinking Puerh tea has restored his once-frail health. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

Today, Ray stands tall and walks without any aid. He founded Yuencha Land , an appointment-only tea studio in Hong Kong that serves mostly organically grown raw Puerh sourced from mountain trees that are more than 400 years old.

""I think everyone should find a tea that's good for their bodies. Puerh is what works for me,"" says Ray, who credits the drink with restoring his health.

Marketing, rarity and tastes

Much of the problem with artificially aged Puerh dates back to the post-WWII period.

Once a tea served to emperors, Puerh lost its luster over time. It was even dubbed ""coolie tea"" in the Canton area, suggesting it was a drink reserved for low-income workers.

Rather than aging it and letting it ferment naturally, sellers relied on the humidity in the Canton area to accelerate the process, which intensified the flavors. New techniques were developed to add extra moisture to the leaves and developing cultures to further speed things up.

The resulting musty, camphor smell became the signature of aged Puerh.

Today, there are different schools of thought attached to Puerh tea and its often high price tags, like with other Chinese teas.

""It is hard to untangle the history behind it,"" says Ray. ""Marketing definitely plays an important role in many of these record-breaking prices.""

Rarity is another factor, not just for Puerh tea but all varieties.

Some of the tea is so rare that there is no price tag -- the leaves are not for sale. For example, the original Da Hong Pao trees are state-protected. meaning they aren't harvested for commercial purposes.

""There is also a price for commercial tea and another price for artisanal tea. It's like the difference between house wine and collectors' wines,"" says Yeung.

What makes a tea good?

For customers sampling these high-end brews, Yeung has an important reminder.

""Have a piece of food, or you will get tea drunk,"" she says.

Tea has a similar effect as alcohol, but with arguably fewer side effects. Consuming too much tea can make one relax and feel light-headed: tea drunk.

""Tea helps expand your palette during a meal. So I'd argue it is a more suitable drink to pair with food than coffee and wine. Your tongue will be more sensitive as you drink tea,"" says Yeung.

According to both Ray and Yeung, the senses will play an increasingly important role in the future of tea as more people disregard the classic tales and marketing techniques, purely wanting to pursue the all-important question -- how should a good tea taste?

""I'd look into these six categories: color, fragrance, taste, aftertaste, chi and nature,"" says Ray.

""The latter two are more abstract. Chi is the liveliness and complexity of a tea -- how it will change in your mouth, whereas nature is how the tea reacts with your body,"" says Ray.

Yeung doesn't give me an answer right away. Instead, she goes into the kitchen and returns with a server and a pot of tea leaves.

Water boils in a vintage silver pot -- which is said to boost the ion in the water and make the water's texture silkier.

The tea is brewed in a violet clay pot that helps keep the leaves warm. Once the temperature drops, the leaves will contract and release fewer flavors.

The brewing is quick. The tea, a clear red hue, is poured out almost as soon as the pot is filled.

Consuming too much tea can make one feel light-headed. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

""Drink it. This is the Niu Lan Keng Rougui,"" says Yeung. She gathers the team around to have a sip of the next brews. (A batch of good tea leaves can be brewed up to 10 times on average.)

""We don't brew a Niu Lan Keng Rougui every day so everyone is excited,"" she says with a smile, pouring about HKD28,000 (or $3,577) worth of tea into everyone's mini tea cups.

The first sip numbs the tongue. Then the flavors of the citrus and the wood we sampled earlier come in slowly but in a much more condensed and gentle form.

""It should be clear, fragrant, 'gan,' harmonious and alive -- it changes on your tongue,"" says Yeung.

Gan, often translated as sweet, is a Chinese word that describes a specific kind of sweetness and freshness that's accompanied by a hint of bitterness.

293,China's zero-Covid policy is showing signs of strain. But ditching it now could be a disaster,"Hong Kong (CNN) For nearly two years, China's daily Covid caseload rarely extended into triple digits, and often weeks went by without a single case.

Even as the rest of the world struggled to contain new, more transmissible variants, China remained an island -- its borders shut and population largely untouched by the virus.

All that changed this month, as multiple outbreaks across the country saw the largest surge in China's local infections since it brought its initial outbreak in Wuhan under control in early 2020.

Some 12,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days alone, according to health officials, who have warned the country's defenses are facing the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant BA.2 for the first time.

These numbers may seem small in a population of 1.4 billion and when compared to the rest of the world. But to the ruling Communist Party -- which has sought to promote its ability to control the virus as evidence for its superior model of governance -- the outbreak represents a significant political challenge.

But this approach, known broadly as ""zero-Covid,"" is showing signs of strain.

Already authorities have moved to revise their rule for hospitalizing all patients, in a sign they are worried their own stringent measures could quickly overwhelm the health care system. And there are also indications that the patience of the general public, which has been broadly supportive of the measures, is starting to wear thin.

For now, anyway, China's leaders may have few other options. Authorities have spent two years focused on keeping Covid-19 out of its borders and quashing its spread. But now, as more questions are raised about the sustainability of ""zero-Covid,"" experts say the country remains unprepared for the alternative of ""living with the virus.""

Shanghai physician Zhang Wenhong -- often likened to top American epidemiologist Dr. Anthony Fauci for his straight-talk and expertise -- alluded to this dilemma last week, writing in the business journal Caixin: ""We haven't prepared anything of what we need to prepare. How could we possibly dare to 'lie down' (and allow the virus to spread)?""

Not prepared

To be sure, China has undertaken massive efforts to protect its people from the virus, pulling off what's been called the largest vaccination campaign in history -- developing vaccines at record speed and doling out 2.8 billion doses domestically in 2021 alone.

But despite this, there are both critical gaps in Beijing's vaccination effort and -- though the vaccines are thought to remain effective against severe disease and death from Omicron -- unresolved questions about how just how well they can protect, especially for vulnerable groups. That poses significant concerns for any transition away from zero-Covid for a country that had grown used to seeing no Covid-19 deaths.

While the vast majority of China's cases have been mild or asymptomatic, the government reported the first Covid-19 deaths in more than a year on Saturday. Health authorities said the deceased -- two elderly Covid-19 patients in northeastern Jilin province, one vaccinated, one not -- had mild cases and succumbed to their underlying conditions.

But experts say the risks of a more serious situation have been made starkly clear for Beijing by the events over the border in Hong Kong, where a rampant outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals and morgues, leading to more than 5,500 deaths so far this year, largely due the low vaccination rate among the elderly.

While one is a city of less than 8 million and the other a nation of 1.4 billion, experts say parallels have raised alarms in recent weeks.

A temporary hospital for the Covid-19 patients in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province in March, 2022.

""Both have pursued a 'zero-Covid strategy,' both have a large unvaccinated elderly population, and in addition (both) have not invested in public health surge capacity building before the Omicron wave arrived,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.

""And in China, you have a large percentage of the general population that have not been exposed to the virus, because of zero-Covid, or that are vaccinated with vaccines that (studies show) are not effective in preventing infection.""

While China's overall vaccination rate tops 87%, immunization among the elderly, and especially the most vulnerable over 80s, lags that of countries like the US or Britain, as these groups were not originally prioritized in China's vaccination campaigns.

An estimated 40 million Chinese over the age of 60 have yet to receive a vaccine, according to data from China's National Health Commission. While some 80% of China's 264 million elderly people are fully vaccinated, that percentage falls to only around half for the group most vulnerable to Covid-19, those over 80 years old.

""We have been ringing the alarm bell again and again about this -- it's a hard-learned lesson not only for Hong Kong, but also for China,"" said Jin Dongyan, a professor at the University of Hong Kong's School of Biomedical Sciences.

A medical worker takes a swab sample from a resident for nucleic acid test at a community of Jiutai District in Changchun, northeast China's Jilin Province on March 18, 2022.

China's potential problem is further compounded by its reluctance to approve a foreign mRNA vaccine , which could be used as a booster dose, despite securing an option on 100 million doses of a widely used vaccine by Germany's BioNTech in late 2020.

""(Not approving the BioNTech shot) was also a missed opportunity for Chinese policy to out-evolve the virus,"" said health security expert Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at City University of Hong Kong, who called the decision a ""clear example of vaccine nationalism"" in favor of China's domestic shots.

""Had they (approved the BioNTech vaccine last year), given the impressive resources that China deployed with their earlier vaccination program, it is unlikely that they would now be facing the same threat from the Omicron outbreak,"" he said.

While several homegrown mRNA vaccines are in development -- with at least one in the final phase of clinical trials -- it remains unclear when or whether those doses will ultimately be approved, or if they'll measure up the existing shots in use around the world.

Potentially compounding these risks is that many of China's elderly live in the countryside, where health care is significantly less advanced than in cities. China's ability to handle a crush of severe cases could also be hampered by its ICU capacity, which falls well below that of many Western countries.

There are signs that China is seeking to fill the gaps. In recent days health authorities have given updates on efforts, for example, to enlist mobile clinics to get elderly people vaccinated and stress the importance of their booster drive. They've also included the foreign Covid-19 antiviral pill by Pfizer in the latest guidelines -- a new addition to China's medicine cabinet -- and said that Omicron-specific vaccines are in the works.

End game?

The problems that China faces are not necessarily unique: countries across the world have battled Covid-19 with low vaccination rates in the elderly and ailing health systems.

In China, because heavy-handed tactics have so far allowed the population to steer clear of the worst effects of the virus, experts say relaxing those measures could come as a shock.

""The pressure to maintain zero-Covid is not only from the central government but also the general public,"" said Xi Chen, a professor at Yale School of Public Health, pointing to public support for the government's measures in the past two years.

While there are signs that people and experts in China are beginning to look more toward policies in the rest of the world to ""live with the virus,"" this may also require a significant shift for official messaging that has focused on the gravity of health crises outside China's borders, even after mass vaccination campaigns reduced deaths in developed countries.

""The problem is that if you continue to highlight the danger of the disease and demonize the pandemic response efforts of other countries, it means that the fear in the public won't fade away, and that makes moving away from a zero-Covid strategy difficult,"" said CFR's Huang.

And even if this outbreak is brought under control, these questions will continue to rise to the fore in China, as containing Omicron amounts to a ""Sisyphean effort"" for China's leaders and its people, he said.

""They are not going to eradicate all the Omicron cases in China...they are just waiting for the next round.""

294,"Rocket Lab catches, then drops booster in helicopter capture attempt","New York (CNN Business) Rocket Lab, which aims to launch satellites into space quickly and cheaply, said it just used a helicopter to catch part of a rocket in mid-air. But the rocket was dropped into the ocean shortly after, ending up having to be fished out of the water.

This mission, labeled ""There and Back Again,"" took off at 6:50 pm ET.

Company communications advisor, Murielle Baker, after initially declaring success, came onto the companies webcast to acknowledge the pilot of the helicopter dropped the rocket ""at his discretion"" after experiencing a ""different load characteristic"" than he had during test runs of the catch.

Still, Baker called the initial catch ""a monumental step forward.""

""We witnessed a spectacular catch,"" she said.

The webcast showed the helicopter snag the rocket's parachute about 15 minutes after launch, and a cheer arose from mission control, but moments later a disappointed sigh could be heard and the feed cut out.

""They did release it after hook up as they were not happy with the way it was flying,"" Peter Beck, CEO of Rocket Lab, added on Twitter

""It demands extreme precision. Several critical milestones need to align perfectly to ensure a successful capture,"" Baker had said earlier in the webcast.

The Electron rocket, Rocket Lab's small rocket which had launched nearly two dozen successful missions prior to Monday's launch, did successfully complete its primary objective: It deployed 34 satellite payloads for a number of commercial operators, bringing the total number of Electron-launched satellites in space to 146.

After separating from the first-stage booster, the Electron's second-stage continued to orbit to fulfill the satellite deployment while the booster fell back to Earth at nearly 5,150 miles per hour. Once near enough to the Earth's surface, the booster deployed parachutes to slow its descent. A helicopter waited to snag the booster's parachute with a hook.

Catching the rocket booster mid-air is a big part of Rocket Lab's eventual goal of reusable rockets.

said that the future of space tourism and people living on other planets would depend on reusable transport after Other companies have used reusable rockets as a way to make the space business more cost effective. In 2015, Blue Origin was the first company to land a reusable rocket on a landing pad. The companysaid that the future of space tourism and people living on other planets would depend on reusable transport after sending founder Jeff Bezos to space. Elon Musk's SpaceX uses reusable boosters in its Falcon 9 rockets.

Rocket Lab, however, says it has other reasons for focusing on reusability than just profit. ""Our biggest problem is building rockets fast enough to support all our customers,"" Beck told CNN Business in 2019. Rocket Lab wants to launch satellite payloads more frequently — 50 times or more a year. That kind of volume requires rocket reuse.

NASA has retrieved spent rocket boosters from the Atlantic Ocean after a Space Shuttle launch. Rocket Lab plans to pursue the helicopter technique to recover its boosters. The company has said Electron is not large enough to carry the fuel supply needed for an upright landing, and a saltwater ocean landing can cause corrosion and physical damage.

A customized Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, a large twin-engine chopper usually used for search and rescue missions and offshore oil and gas transportation, was used in Monday's grab. After the successful capture of the booster, the company planned to fly the machinery to an at-sea recovery vessel before moving to the company's production complex for assessment. But, ultimately it was jettisoned into the ocean and recovered form there. Ocean landings aren't optimal — the sea water can cause corrosion, which is why Rocket Lab hopes to snag the booster before it meets the water.

The launch was postponed several times due to weather conditions. ""For our first mid-air helicopter capture, we want ideal weather conditions so we can focus on the catch,"" Rocket Lab tweeted on Monday. ""Just like our weather tolerances for launch have increased over time, so will our tolerance for weather in the recovery zone. For this first one though, we want to eliminate weather as a consideration so we can focus solely on the catch and supporting operations.""

The California-based company also released a video showing a successful practice run in the days leading up to launch, with a helicopter capturing a dummy booster as it fell to the ground.

Rocket Lab has previously fished boosters from the ocean in three of Electron's 25 earlier missions. This was the first attempt at a mid-air catch.

This isn't the first time humans have attempted to catch an object falling from space with aircraft. During the 1960s, the United States would use planes equipped with long hooks to grab film canisters containing film from spy satellites out of the sky. The Cold War-era technique was similar to the one attempted by Rocket Lab: the film canister fell to Earth from outer space and used parachutes to slow its descent so that planes could nab the intel. NASA also attempted in 2004 a mid-air grab of a capsule carrying samples of particles that had streamed off the sun, but the helicopter recovery attempt failed when the capsule's parachutes failed to release, causing it to crash into the Utah desert.

Since its start in 2006, Rocket Lab has deployed satellites to orbit for customers including NASA, the US Space Force, the National Reconnaissance Office and Canon.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/tech/rocket-lab-helicopter-booster/index.html
295,The S&P is having its worst start to a year since 1939,"New York (CNN Business) The S&P 500 fell more than 13% between January and April of this year. That's the worst four-month start to a year since 1939, when longtime legendary investor Warren Buffett was just nine years-old.

Comparing today's stock market to 83 years ago isn't an entirely apples-to-comparison — for one, the S&P was made up of only 90 companies back then. But it has clearly been an abysmal first third of the year for investors from any reference point. The Dow was down 9% through April and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 21%.

Stocks finished higher on a wild day of trading Monday. The Dow rose 84 points, or 0.3%, after falling more than 525 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 increased 0.6% while the Nasdaq gained 1.6%.

There is an old Wall Street adage that many investors ""sell in May and go away."" It's a pithy reference to the theory that bullish traders take a break during the summer and early autumn months and that stocks will typically fall until just before the winter holidays.

But this year the big sell-off may already have happened, as there appears to have been a fair amount of panic-induced stock selling recently. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index , which measures seven indicators of market sentiment, was in Fear mode after briefly falling into Extreme Fear territory Monday.

Investors already have gone away ... and might now come back

But there's another pithy saying among traders: ""Stocks climb a wall of worry."" Markets often rally in troubling times, partly because investors are looking ahead to a rosier future when all those fears diminish.

So is the worst for stocks still yet to come, or is the market finally close to bottoming? Some strategists see reasons for optimism.

""The markets are likely giving too little credence to supply chain progress, anti-inflationary policy moves and energy market resilience — all of which appear to be moving in the right direction and could improve sentiment and valuation in due course,"" Robert Teeter, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, said in a note Monday.

Teeter added that the jobs market remains healthy and that earnings reports for the first quarter have mostly been ""respectable"" despite ""several prominent stumbles,"" mainly in tech.

""With much of the bad news out in the open and the prospect of better news in store, investors may be prudent to extend their time horizon as problem-solving takes hold,"" Teeter added.

Stagflation worries persist, but so far, it's all 'flation' and no 'stag'

American consumers aren't showing signs of being too worried just yet.

Although confidence and sentiment measures have been declining due to inflation concerns, retail sales remain strong, a phenomenon that some economists have dubbed ""revenge spending"" following two brutal pandemic years. And as far as corporate profits go, actions speak louder than words.

""After two years of Covid restrictions, people want to get out and have the means to do it. Household cash has exceeded debt for the first time in three decades,"" said Linda Duessel, senior equity strategist with Federated Hermes, in a report last week.

""Corporate America is in great shape, too,"" she added. ""Profits and cash flow are at record highs. Profit margins are at or near record highs. S&P 500 earnings estimates keep rising. And corporate balance sheets are flush with cash.""

There are legitimate reasons to be worried that the combination of rising interest rates and higher oil prices could eventually lead to a recession or stagflation, the combination of slow growth and surging consumer prices. But we don't appear to be there yet, which is good for investors.

What's more, the whole selling in May and going away strategy has not held true over the past few years.

It's a quaint idea to think that stocks should stumble in the summer because traders are supposedly hopping on the Jitney to the Hamptons and throwing their phones in the Atlantic Ocean. But last year, the S&P rose 10% between the start of May and the end of October.

According to data compiled last year by LPL Financial, the S&P 500 has averaged a 5.7% gain between May and October over the past decade. The only time the market fell in that period was in 2015.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/investing/stocks-sell-may-go-away/index.html
296,These numbers are bad news if you're trying to buy or refinance a house,"New York (CNN Business) Bad news for anyone trying to buy a house or refinance an existing loan: The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, which influences how much consumers pay for mortgages and a variety of other loans, briefly topped the 3% level Monday for the first time since December 2018.

Long-term bond yields have nearly doubled this year, largely due to worries about inflation and the likelihood of supersized interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The 10-year yield started 2022 at a little above 1.5%.

Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, so the big increase is a sign that fixed-income investors are growing more nervous.

The Fed has already raised its key short-term interest rate once this year, by a quarter of a percentage point, in March. That was the first hike since late 2018 and pushed up rates from zero for the first time since the Fed slashed rates in March 2020 due to worries about the pandemic.

But the central bank is now expected to move more aggressively with rate hikes starting this week. The monetary policy-making arm of the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and traders are pricing in a nearly 100% chance of a half-point increase.

297,Germany will support an EU oil embargo on Russia,"London (CNN Business) Germany is ready to support a European ban on imports of Russian oil , and won't be "" blackmailed"" by Moscow into paying for natural gas in rubles.

Speaking to CNN's Julia Chatterley on Monday, finance minister Christian Lindner said Germany would agree any new sanctions on Russia with its partners in the European Union.

""Germany stands ready for new sanctions, including an oil embargo,"" he said.

The European Union has already agreed to phase out Russian coal imports as part of a fifth wave of sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

But the bloc has found it much harder to reach consensus on joining a US-led embargo on Russian oil despite weeks of talks . Hungary reiterated its opposition to an oil embargo again on Monday, Reuters reported.

JUST WATCHED These maps show how natural gas is behind Russia's power Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These maps show how natural gas is behind Russia's power 03:25

Lindner said he did not want to speculate on whether some EU member states, such as Hungary, would have to be given exemptions or carve outs from an oil embargo.

""I can assure you that Germany is ready to reduce oil imports, we know others are considering this question carefully,"" he added.

Last year, Russia accounted for about 27% of EU oil imports. It also supplied about 40% of Europe's natural gas. EU leaders have already promised to slash Russian gas imports by 66% this year, and to break the bloc's dependency completely by 2027.

""We have prepared ourselves to be less dependent on Russian energy imports,"" Lindner said. ""We can reduce the imports, starting with coal, then oil. It will take more time to be independent from Russian natural gas imports, but we will continue so in the end we will be completely independent from Russia.""

Moscow raised the stakes in a tense energy standoff with Europe last week by cutting off supplies of natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria. State gas giant Gazprom said neither country had agreed to President Vladimir Putin's demand that customers in ""unfriendly"" countries must open two accounts at Gazprombank — one in euros and the second in rubles, from which payments for the gas would be made.

The vast majority of Gazprom's contracts with its European customers stipulate payment in euros or dollars. The Kremlin's ultimatum regarding ruble payments is widely seen as a move to bolster its war chest and boost the Russian currency.

Is Germany next?

German gas distributor Uniper said last week it would continue to pay for its Russian supplies in euros but added that it believed a ""payment conversion compliant with sanctions law"" was possible. It said it was examining the matter carefully in close coordination with the German government.

Lindner said he expected Germany's utilities to honor the terms of their contracts, which require payment in euros or dollars.

""Germany can't be blackmailed, we know there is a dependency on natural gas from Russia, it is a reality. We need time to reduce this dependency,"" he told CNN. ""This is the situation of the contracts and we do not change because Putin needs rubles for his war chest.""

Germany has reduced its consumption of Russian gas to 35% of imports from 55% before the war in Ukraine, but says it needs to keep buying from Moscow at least until next year to avoid a deep recession.

Uniper said that it cannot cope without Russian gas in the short term.

""This would have dramatic consequences for our economy,"" it said in its statement.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/energy/germany-russia-oil-embargo/index.html

299,Amazon workers vote against New York union drive,"(CNN Business) The grassroots labor union that made history last month when it formed the first union at an Amazon warehouse in the United States has lost a union election at a much smaller facility just across the street.

The election, held last week at the Staten Island sorting facility known as LDJ5 and the votes of which were counted Monday, was the second to be organized by the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a newly established union, started by a local group of Amazon warehouse workers and led by a fired employee.

A public tally of the vote, held Monday at the National Labor Relation Board's Brooklyn office and broadcast over Zoom, heavily favored not unionizing. There were 618 votes against unionizing and 380 in favor. Out of approximately 1,633 eligible voters, 998 votes were counted. There were no challenged ballots. Two ballots were voided.

In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the company is ""glad that our team at LDJ5 were able to have their voices heard. We look forward to continuing to work directly together as we strive to make every day better for our employees.""

While the ALU did not immediately respond to CNN Business' request for comment, it tweeted : ""The organizing will continue at this facility and beyond. The fight has just begun.""

Both parties have five business days to file any objections.

The LDJ5 election drew significant attention from prominent labor leaders, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who rallied with Amazon workers on Staten Island a day before the election started.

The ALU's unlikely success in its first election at Amazon's JFK8 warehouse, which employs more than 8,000 workers and is also located on Staten Island, is viewed as a milestone event with potential broader implications for Amazon's sprawling network of facilities. The win quickly drew praise from advocacy groups, established labor unions and the White House.

Following the LDJ5 result, Teamsters general president Sean O'Brien, who recently met with ALU leaders following the JFK8 victory, signaled a continued focus on organizing Amazon workers. ""The fight at Amazon continues. The only thing this greedy, abusive company won today is a guarantee that Amazon workers everywhere will not give up until they have a union,"" said O'Brien in a statement. AFL-CIO presdient Liz Shuler tweeted that it ""stands in solidarity"" with the ALU worker organizers ""who are changing the world and just getting started.""

According to John Logan, a professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, the results are no doubt a disappointment for the union. ""If it had won, things could have solidified for the union in a big way,"" he said. But the stakes were higher for Amazon, Logan argued.

""A second defeat could have proved fatal to the company's efforts to stop the organizing from spreading like wildfire, just as it has done at Starbucks,"" he said.

ALU's organizing efforts grew out of tensions between Amazon and Staten Island workers over the company's pandemic response along with existing frustrations about working conditions. Amazon's workplace has been under scrutiny for its high turnover rates and on-the-job injuries in recent years.

Christian Smalls, who was fired by Amazon at the start of the pandemic and is now ALU's president, called the JFK8 win ""a catalyst for a revolution with Amazon workers, just like the Starbucks unionizing effort"" in an interview with CNN last month . ""We want to have the same domino effect.""

Following Monday's result, Smalls tweeted : ""Despite todays outcome I'm proud of the worker/organizers of LDJ5 they had a tougher challenge after our victory at JFK8.""

He added that ALU ""will continue to organize and so should all of you""

Amazon has repeatedly said in statements that its ""employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union,"" while spending millions on consultants to combat unions last year alone and running an anti-union campaign inside the facilities. Amazon said it was ""disappointed"" with the JFK8 results and laid out a number of objections to the previous Staten Island union vote as it called for a do-over; an NLRB hearing on the matter is scheduled for later this month. (A tally of votes last month in a separate re-election at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama organized by an established labor union were too close to call. The NLRB expects to hold a hearing on the matter but it has not yet been scheduled.)

""All the issues are the same. Of course there are differences between the buildings, but we need the union at JFK8. We need the union at LDJ5. We need the union at all Amazon warehouses all across the world,"" said ALU's treasurer and LDJ5 employee, Madeline Wesley, at a union rally ahead of the LDJ5 election. ""This is just the beginning.""

As ALU organizers focused on rallying support for the vote at the JFK8 election, Amazon was messaging its stance on unionizing to workers inside LDJ5, several workers told CNN Business last week at the rally ahead of the election. After the JFK8 result, the ALU's attention turned to LDJ5.

Justine Medina, a JFK8 warehouse worker and ALU organizer, told CNN Business last week that due to the smaller size of LDJ5, Amazon's efforts may have been more effective. ""It is just so much more intense,"" said Medina.

LDJ5 worker Andrew Perez told CNN Business last week that he was pulled into required meetings in recent weeks where company representatives offered their stance on unions, including harping on union dues. Perez said at the time he anticipated the election results would be close.

In recent weeks, there have been a number of new developments and attention paid to Amazon's treatment of, and relationship to, its warehouse workforce.

Amazon disclosed in a filing last month that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch would lead a racial equity audit of its US hourly employees to ""evaluate any disparate racial impacts"" of its policies and practices. The move comes as Amazon faces shareholder pressure to undergo a racial equity audit in a proposal slated to come up to vote at the company's annual meeting later this month.

Meanwhile, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo issued a memo taking issue with one of the ways employers like Amazon seek to combat union drives — through so-called captive audience meetings, or required meetings where companies convey their anti-union stance. While currently legally permissible, Abruzzo called on the agency to reconsider the legality of required attendance at such meetings. Amazon previously declined to comment on Abruzzo's memo.

And in a win for the ALU, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Amazon had violated labor law in its firing of a JFK8 employee named Gerald Bryson, who is an ALU organizer. Bryson, like Smalls, was fired by Amazon in March 2020 after protesting pandemic-related workplace safety precautions. While Amazon has denied retaliating against Bryson, the judge ordered Bryson be reinstated and paid his lost wages. (In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said, ""we strongly disagree with the NLRB judge's ruling,"" and that it plans to appeal.)",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/tech/amazon-labor-union-election-staten-island-ldj5/index.html
300,"America will recover all jobs lost during Covid by this summer, Fitch says","New York (CNN Business) The United States is rapidly approaching a major jobs milestone that highlights the historically strong economic recovery from Covid-19.

By the end of August, the labor market will have fully recaptured all jobs lost during the pandemic, Fitch Ratings projects in a new report shared first with CNN.

If that happens, it means payrolls would have returned to pre-crisis levels in barely two years. By comparison, Fitch said it took a staggering six years and five months for the jobs market to fully bounce back during the painfully slow recovery from the Great Recession.

The late summer target for recovering all the jobs lost from Covid-19 looks doable. The United States is only about 1.6 million jobs shy of February 2020 levels.

That means payrolls would need to grow by about 400,000 jobs per month to get back to pre-pandemic levels. The economy added 431,000 jobs in March and Friday's jobs report is expected to show another 405,000 jobs were gained in April.

301,Opinion: The Fed can't afford to make the wrong moves again,"Desmond Lachman is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He was a deputy director in the International Monetary Fund's Policy Development and Review Department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Economist Milton Friedman famously taught us that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags. By this he meant that it takes time for the Federal Reserve's actions to affect the economy, in much the same way as it takes time for a room's temperature to adjust to changes in a thermostat's setting. If the Fed waits for inflation to manifest itself before raising interest rates, it will have waited too long to prevent inflation from becoming a real problem.

Last year, however, the Federal Reserve chose to ignore Friedman's fundamental teaching and kept monetary policy too loose for too long. At the time, the economy was recovering strongly and receiving its largest peacetime budget stimulus on record, but that did not stop the Fed. And now the central bank is in the uncomfortable predicament of trying to tame inflation that's at a 40-year high while reining in equity, housing and credit markets that are experiencing bubble-like conditions.

Hopefully, when the Fed meets this week, it won't commit to raising interest rates or reducing its balance sheet too aggressively and overcorrect for last year's policy mistakes. If it chooses to do so, we should brace ourselves for a particularly hard economic landing.

The net result of the Fed's monetary policy largesse is that consumer price inflation is now running at its fastest pace since 1981.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/perspectives/fed-monetary-policy-interest-rates/index.html
302,Why the food crisis sparked by Russia's war hasn't hit Gulf states yet,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here .

Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) When Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered an international food crisis, some Middle Eastern importers were hit particularly hard. An economically shattered Lebanon is fighting to avert a bread crisis, war-torn Yemen is already grappling with ""alarming heights"" of food insecurity, and Egypt, which last year imported 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is capping bread prices to dodge hunger at home.

But elsewhere, in an even more arid part of the region, other countries appeared to be relatively unscathed.

The leaders of Gulf Arab countries -- where less than 2% of land is cultivated and 85% of food is imported -- seem to have met this food crisis well-prepared. The secret, analysts say, lies in their decades-long strategy for food security and resources to implement it.

Qatar is the 24th most food secure country in the world as of 2021, ranking highest among Gulf Arab states, according to the Global Food Security Index . Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain follow respectively. Saudi Arabia, the last among them, ranks at 44.

The Gulf states are located in the most arid parts of the Arabian Peninsula, unfit for wide-ranging agriculture due to high temperatures and water scarcity, the effects of which are increasingly worsened by climate change.

Gulf nations have little choice but to rely on imports, exposing themselves to the vulnerabilities of supply disruptions and price rises.

While Gulf states have been planning for food security since the 1990s, the wakeup call came in 2008, analysts say, when import bills skyrocketed amid global inflation after that year's financial crisis. Food supplies hung in the balance after some exporting countries issued export bans to safeguard their own supplies. The shock had ""a strong impact on the region's food and agriculture policy,"" according to the Economist Intelligence Unit

Today, Gulf states are taking a different approach toward self-sufficiency, especially after further food security concerns were triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

""It's been a consistent government security concern given the heat and arid climate,"" said Karen Young, senior fellow at Washington's Middle East Institute. ""But now, there are many other options, and more money to pay for alternatives.""

From energy-efficient desalination plants and water-efficient agriculture to increased hydroponic farming that plants directly into nutrient-rich water, and the controversial practice of buying farmland in export-oriented developing countries, Gulf states have been preparing for an emergency -- a strategy that served them well in the current crisis.

A strategy that gained popularity and unwelcome attention after 2008 was the purchase of cheap farmland abroad. Saudi Arabia was among the leading Gulf states investing in overseas agriculture in countries like Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia after reducing wheat production by about 12.5% annually in 2008 to save the kingdom's scarce water supplies. The practice has been criticized by activists for allegedly denying impoverished farmers access to farmland and resources.

Some of these methods can be expensive, and experts question their reliability and sustainability, especially in the wake of a potential globe-spanning food crisis.

""It is not clear that in case of a real global food crisis they could prevent exporting countries from imposing rationing or an export ban even if they own assets in them,"" said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of Economics.

Apart from food security strategies, GCC states are in a much more economically robust position than their Middle East neighbors, analysts say, and so are able to better fend off food supply disruptions.

""Inflation has been more muted in the Gulf, because of tied currencies to the US dollar,"" Young told CNN, adding that the recent windfall triggered by rising crude oil prices ""is creating a buffer that is keeping these economies and governments in better position.""

Food purchases also comprise a lower proportion of consumer spending for most people in GCC countries compared to other economies in the region, says Young.

The UAE has dedicated an entire ministry to food security, launching a national food security strategy in 2018 that is aimed at placing the country in the Global Food Security Index's top 10 by 2051.

Planting salt-tolerant superfoods in the desert, building indoor vertical farms and smart greenhouses in the Dubai desert are just some of the UAE's efforts to boost local production.

Qatar, which in 2017 was the target of an economic embargo by neighboring countries, launched a national food security strategy that stresses source diversification and contingency planning. Having relied heavily on food imports from neighboring countries, with 400 metric tons of fresh milk and yogurt imported per day through its border with Saudi Arabia, Qatar resorted to building dairy industries in the desert to produce its own milk.

The dairy investments, ""while not necessarily competitive without state support, increase the country's strategic autonomy from its neighbors,"" said Hertog.

Food security has been one of primary causes of political unrest in the Middle East, especially in North Africa where the 2011 Arab Spring uprising toppled longstanding regimes.

""The GCC can be buffered from the kinds of inflation that we see in places like Turkey and Egypt,"" said Young, ""which have pressure on their exchange rate regimes that is pressing up local prices.

""So it's much less of an economic issue for governments, and certainly less of a political issue for populations.""

Saudi Arabia records highest growth rate in a decade on oil boom

Saudi Arabia's economy grew by 9.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, achieving the highest growth rate since 2011, according to government data published in the Saudi state news agency SPA.

Background: Flash estimates of the Saudi Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for the first quarter of 2022 showed the highest growth rate in the past decade, driven by increased oil and non-oil activities, said SPA, citing data from the General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT).

Why it matters: The Middle East's oil exporters have been cashing in as skyrocketing oil prices following the Ukraine war added billions to their coffers. Saudi Arabia's refusal to accelerate increasing oil production beyond its agreement with OPEC+ amid a tightened market has rejuvenated its economy after an eight-year slump that was compounded by the pandemic.

Saudi Arabia feels ""let down"" by US, says senior royal

Saudi Arabia feels ""let down"" by the United States with regards to tackling security threats by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, said Prince Turki al-Faisal on Sunday, a senior member of the Saudi royal family and former intelligence chief.

Background: Speaking on the Saudi news outlet Arab News, Prince Faisal discussed Saudi Arabia and the US' strained relations amid what Gulf allies perceive as the Western power's waning security presence in the Middle East. ""Saudis consider the relationship as being strategic, but (feel) as being let down at a time when we thought that America and Saudi Arabia should be together in facing what we would consider to be a joint, not just irritant, but danger to the stability and security of the area,"" said Prince Turki al-Faisal said, referring to Houthi attacks.

Why it matters: Ties between Saudi Arabia and US President Joe Biden have been strained due to several disagreements about oil production and regional security. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the two allies' differences. Biden, who has thus far refused to speak to the kingdom's crown prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman, has struggled to persuade Saudi Arabia to accelerate the increase of oil production beyond agreements with OPEC+ (of which Russia is a member), which could drive down prices. US allies in the Middle East, mainly Gulf monarchies and Israel, have also repeatedly expressed worry about an emboldened Iran following a nuclear deal, saying that the US needs to do more to fight off Houthi attacks.

Israeli security guard, Palestinian killed amid continued West Bank tensions

An Israeli security guard was killed on Friday at the entrance of Ariel, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. Shortly afterwards, the Palestinian Health ministry said that Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian man in the northern West Bank village of Azzun.

Background: The Israeli guard was shot and killed by two Palestinian gunmen who opened fire after arriving at the entrance to the settlement in a vehicle, said the IDF. In a video statement, the Palestinian group Al Aqsa Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack. Two Palestinians suspected of the Israeli guard's killing were arrested, Israeli security agencies said in a joint statement Saturday. In the West Bank village of Azzun, a 27-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces in clashes that began shortly after the guard was killed.

Why it matters: The shooting came amid an uptick in violence between Israelis and Palestinians since early March, after Israeli police entered the Al Aqsa compound earlier this month to counter what they described as riots by Palestinians, which left more than 200 wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. However, celebrations at Al Aqsa Mosque were peaceful on Monday morning as some 200,000 Muslim worshipers marked Eid al Fitr with prayers.

Around the region

Dubai-based Palestinian-Egyptian Mohamed Sarour knew he had made it as a musician when his tracks were featured in a hit Marvel television series.

Not only was he introducing a relatively new genre of Middle Eastern tunes to an audience of millions, but he also mixed them with classical Arabic songs sung generations ago by giants of the region's music industry.

The series, ""Moon Knight,"" stars Oscar Isaac, Ethan Hawke, and May Calamawy. It follows the story of a mild-mannered shop employee who discovers he has dissociative identity disorder and shares a body with mercenary. The first and third episodes heavily feature music from the Arabic trap creations of Sarour, who is known as DJ Kaboo (trap is a subgenre of hip-hop).

The two tracks that were used in the series, ""Enta"" and ""Made in Egypt,"" were released years before the show aired. It was Egyptian-American writer and producer Sarah Goher, wife and creative partner to the show's director Mohamed Diab, who was responsible for many of the music selections for the show, Sarour said.

Kaboo sampled the popular songs ""Khosara"" by Egyptian Abdel Halim Hafez and the 1952 classic ""batwanes beek"" by Warda for the music that was featured. ""Why can't I take something from our music library and bring it back to life in a new modern way,"" he told CNN. Kaboos's multicultural crowds in Dubai have prompted him to mix music from different cultures.

Kaboo sees the way that his music was used on the show as a step forward from the stereotypical use of Arabic music in Hollywood movies. ""A lot of people didn't know that there is a new genre called Arab trap."" All eyes are on the Middle East music scene now, but there is work to be done, he says. ""The only way for us to export our music to the globe is by us trying to support the local scene first before importing the music scene from abroad.""

303,Has inflation reached a peak? Three signs that prices could soon come down,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here

New York (CNN Business) Inflation is at a 40-year high , and Americans are feeling it.

A gallon of gas costs about double what it cost in January 2021. Home prices were up a whopping 19.8% year-over-year in February. And, in March, groceries cost 10% more than they did a year earlier.

'Puts me on the street': Americans forced out of homes as rents skyrocket

Thankfully some analysts think that the burden could soon ease, and that we've reached an inflationary top.



This week, the Federal Reserve will meet and likely announce plans to raise interest rates, a tool used to combat rampant inflation. However, investors fear that accelerating the pace of interest rate hikes could drag the economy into recession.

Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, thinks it's likely that inflation has already reached a peak on its own, and that the Fed could start to pull back on interest rates by the second half of the year.

The core personal consumption expenditures index , which the Federal Reserve closely watches to measure the price of goods and services, grew by 5.2% in March, excluding food and energy prices, coming in below economists' expectations and falling on a monthly basis for the first time since October 2020.

Analysts at UBS also said this month that they expect inflation will likely peak in March and then fall ""sharply.""

Detrick points to three key economic indicators for that belief: a drop in used car prices, a lack of ""sticky"" inflation, and a relative easing in supply chain chaos (though China's Covid-related shutdowns could put an end to that).

The chip shortage caused by supply chain kinks and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has made getting a new car very difficult, and the prices of used cars and trucks have correspondingly soared. In February, the price of a used car was up about 45% year-over-year, according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index . But it has since come down to about 25%. Two months of declines show that the prices of used cars, which make up 4% of the consumer price index, could finally be reverting back to pre-pandemic levels.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta breaks inflation into two categories: sticky and flexible. Sticky inflation is a basket of goods that tends to change more slowly and permanently in price, things like the cost of education, public transportation and motor vehicle insurance. Flexible inflation includes items that move up and down in cost more quickly: gas, clothing, milk and cheese.

During the stagflation of the 1970s, both sticky and flexible inflation grew. But so far sticky inflation has remained relatively flat compared with flexible inflation, a good sign that this could still be temporary.

Of course, it could take some time for sticky inflation to play catch up, but Detrick says he's optimistic. Flexible inflation is like a rubber band, he said, you can stretch it pretty far and it will still snap back.

And though shutdowns in China could hurt the global supply chain, it does appear that problems are easing -- at least for now. If businesses can easily obtain more supplies, the prices of materials go down and consumers won't be charged as much for goods and services, said Detrick.

Shipping rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles, New York and Rotterdam are down 28% on average from the peak last year, according to LPL Financial's data. Schedule reliability for container ships is also continuing to improve, according to new data from analytics firm Sea-Intelligence . March also marked the third consecutive month of declines in average delays for container ships.

The move lower in inflation could be sudden as a result, especially for durable goods, said Detrick. Still, he warned, it's hard to tell if we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel — or an oncoming train.

Buffett and Munger's big day

Investors flocked to Omaha this weekend for Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, the first since 2019.

There, they watched market gurus Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger deliver remarks about the state of the economy and the stock market. They also enjoyed sweet treats provided by Berkshire-owned See's Candies and Dairy Queen, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports

Between all of the ice cream cones and caramels, Berkshire disclosed Saturday that it bought more than $51 billion in stock during the first quarter of 2022, even though Buffett described his current investing mood as ""lethargic.""

More than $3 billion of that was their own stock, but other big names included Chevron, Apple, Bank of America and American Express. Together, those four stocks are approximately two-thirds of the fair value of Berkshire's nearly $388 billion portfolio.

Charlie Munger used his platform Saturday to speak out against bitcoin and cryptocurrency, which he compared to a ""venereal disease"" earlier this year.

Munger said Saturday that if an investment advisor wants you to put retirement money in bitcoin, ""Just say no,"" in an apparent knock at Fidelity's recent announcement that it is planning to let investors buy bitcoin for their 401(k) accounts

He also attacked what he called a ""disgusting"" surge in gambling-like attitudes toward investing, popularized by meme stocks. ​​Munger said the recent ""unraveling"" in the online trading platform Robinhood's stock price was ""some justice.""

304,EU says Apple Pay restrictions may harm competitors,"Washington (CNN Business) The European Union is warning Apple about possible antitrust violations after an investigation into the iPhone maker's dominance in mobile retail payments.

Apple AAPL The European Commission said Monday that it believeshas unfairly blocked competitors from using the wireless communications technology behind Apple Pay's tap-to-pay capabilities.

According to a statement of objections the European Commission sent to Apple, the company has restricted access to its devices' near-field communications (NFC) equipment, and only Apple Pay may use it.

That means rivals that want to create apps or wallets utilizing the tap-to-pay features on iPhones can't do so, a rule by Apple that's harmed innovation, the Commission's executive vice president, Margrethe Vestager, said.

""Developing a mobile payment application is costly,"" Vestager said in a statement. ""Investment may only be worth it if developers can reach both Apple and Android customers. Evidence on our file indicates that some developers did not go ahead with their plans as they were not able to to reach iPhone users.""

305,Putin keeps the ruble surging as Russia makes 11th-hour effort to avoid default,"New York (CNN Business) Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to support the ruble continue to pay off — and then some.

Russia's currency hit a two-year high against the US dollar Friday. The ruble gained ground after the country said it managed to pay back creditors with dollars as Russia tries to avoid a default

The country's finance ministry said in a statement that it made a $565 million eurobond that was due this year, as well as an $84 million eurobond that was set to mature in 2024. Both payments were made in US dollars, the finance ministry claimed, as required by the bond's contract stipulations.

""The payments were made in the currency of issue of the corresponding eurobonds — in US dollars,"" Russia's finance ministry said in a statement. ""In this way, the obligations of servicing sovereign eurobonds are being carried out in observance of the conditions laid out in the issue documentation.""

On April 6, Russia said it had made the payments on those bonds in rubles, leading S&P to declare three days later that Russia was in default on its foreign debt obligations. Although the dollar payments are already overdue, Russia's late payment in dollars serves as a last-ditch effort to avoid default.

306,Why car shopping is so bizarre in the United States,"(CNN) The way we buy cars in America is just weird.

Just think about it for a moment. When you want to buy a refrigerator, you don't go to a Whirlpool store, then a Maytag store and a Bosch store. You go to an appliance store. And even if there is a store that only sells clothing from one company -- like Gap, which only sells clothing from Gap -- that store is owned and operated by Gap.

But when you want to buy a new car you have to go to different stores for different brands. The Ford store isn't owned by Ford, though, and the Toyota store isn't owned by Toyota. They're owned by other companies, some big and some small, but very rarely are they owned by the company that has its name over the front door.

Most new cars today are purchased from franchised dealers, a system that's enshrined in law. Why is that?

What's even more bizarre, if a new car company wants to open its own store and sell directly to customers, it's illegal for them to do that in many US states. If an established automaker wants to start doing that, it's illegal virtually everywhere in America.

But how did it get to be this way? Why is this system so resistant to change?

The reasons have to do with the complexity of the transaction (buying a car is more complicated than purchasing a refrigerator or pants) but also with the industry's explosive growth in its early years.

A specific solution to a specific problem in a specific time

To understand why we buy and sell cars unlike other goods in America requires a look back at the crazy and often brutal early days of the American auto industry

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, you might see a car parked outside of the general store and the clerk inside would happily take your order for one.

Some companies even sold cars on a literal installment plan. Customers would order one or a few parts at a time that were delivered through the mail and, over the course of months, could assemble their own car.

Some enterprising businesspeople became full-time car dealers. William Metzger, who started selling electric and steam-powered cars of various makes in Detroit in 1898, is usually credited as the first car dealer.

""That was one of the big issues in the first 10, 15 years or so of the American automotive industry, "" said Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford museum. ""What is the best model to sell cars to the public? And all sorts of different things were tried.""

Bertha Benz drove around in her husband Karl's creation, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, taking order from curious onlookers. (This print shows a slightly later model of the Patent Motorwagen being driven by a man.)

In those early days, car companies were popping up all over, although many quickly went bust. But with the few that succeeded, car production skyrocketed. US auto production went from 4,000 units in 1900 to 1.9 million in 1920, according to a 1985 article by Thomas Marx in the journal Business History Review.

One company in particular was making so many cars that even more innovations were needed to handle all the sales. That company was Ford Motor Co. and the car was the Model N.

Produced from 1906 to 1908, Ford made 6,000 Model Ns in one year, an astounding number in its day. (The Model N. was a predecessor to the far more more famous Ford Model T.)

Even though Ford hadn't yet started using a moving assembly line, it was still building and selling so many cars -- including other letters of the alphabet -- that the company began recruiting a network of dealers to handle it all.

While Henry Ford oversaw engineering and production of cars, his famously irascible business partner James Couzens handled finances and sales. He recruited independent dealers believing that someone would work hardest when working for themselves.

But he didn't make it easy for them.

Henry Ford (right) and David Gray, a Ford Motor Co. board member, in a Ford Model N outside the company's Piquette Ave. plant.

Dealers were required to pay 50% of a car's value up front when ordering for their inventory and the other half when it was delivered to them, according to Douglas Brinkley's book ""Wheels for the World."" (Other automakers offered more lenient terms.) He also demanded the dealers sell Fords exclusively, said Ford Motor Co. historian Ted Ryan.

Henry Ford himself demanded that dealers keep on hand a ready supply of parts to instantly service Ford cars when needed and, further, that Ford dealerships be kept presentable and clean.

Given the money to be made, dealers were happy to jump in and to sell only Fords. Like canals that had been dug to receive water, these sales channels were largely in place just as the Model T, which would be made in the millions, began flooding the American market.

There were 253 active automakers in the United States in 1908, the year the Model T went on sale, according to the book ""The Automobile Age"" by James Flink. By 1929, there just 44. Even with 44 automakers, 80% of all cars sold in the US that year were made by just three companies, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. They all followed Ford's example of selling through franchised dealers that sold only their brands. Continuing demand for cars and their relatively high cost made that viable.

By the mid-20th century, car dealers had real political influence and helped pass laws that protected their independent businesses from encroachment by big automakers. Here, a salesman shows off the engine of a 1937 Chevrolet Master.

""They had the power to demand brand exclusivity partly because a dealer could survive on just one brand,"" said Brian Allan, a longtime auto retailing executive and now president of Hyrecar, a company that serves rideshare drivers. ""That's very doable compared to other types of products.""

The complexity of the auto sales transaction, what with trade-ins, resale of the owner's used model, and on-going service, also lends itself to reliance on an outside specialist company, as the famous past GM CEO Alfred Sloan, Jr., explained in his book ""My Years with General Motors.""

""Organizing and supervising the necessary thousands of complex trading institutions would have been difficult for the manufacturer,"" he wrote in his memoir published in 1963.

The power of dealers

For a long time, car dealers were largely at the mercy of automakers. A car company could decide, virtually on a whim, to allow another store selling its cars to open right down the street from an existing location. Or the carmaker could just decide to cut a dealership off from new inventory.

But, after a few decades, car dealers began taking advantage of their own power, said The Henry Ford's Anderson.

A car dealer was usually among the biggest local businesses in its area. Car dealers paid taxes, they sponsored local functions like the Little League team and the Fourth of July Parade. And they contributed to political campaigns and the owners even ran for office themselves. Before long, state legislatures across the country were passing laws to protect them from abuse by those big car companies.

""In the forties and fifties you had these sort of mom-and-pop car dealers complaining that they were being taken advantage of by the 'Big Three' [Detroit automakers],"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. ""And so this led to this series of dealer protection laws.""

These corresponding financial and political forces have created a sort of mutual gravitational pull that has bound car dealers and car companies together for many decades since.

It has also kept others out.

These laws were intended to keep big automakers, like General Motors and Ford, from opening their own stores. In many states, the laws are interpreted to keep start-ups like Tesla, Rivian and Lucid from opening their own stores, too, said Crane, even though they wouldn't be competing against already established franchised dealers.

Some say there are very good reasons traditional franchised dealerships should be protected. Car dealerships remain important economic pillars in their communities, said Erin Kerrigan, managing director of Kerrigan Partners, a financial firm that advises auto dealership owners. All that stuff about sponsoring the local Little League team and other community events remains true.

And auto dealerships, especially ones with commissioned sales staff, offer some of the few jobs left at which people can make a comfortable middle class income without getting advanced degrees.

Breaking the model

Some new car companies, like Rivian, Tesla and Lucid, are working to change this system.

They're selling online and opening showrooms in shopping malls where customers can see the cars and use VR goggles to try out different interior designs.

Tesla has had some success and is now able to sell its cars directly to customers in many states. Other start-up automakers are now joining in, looking to break the hold that the entrenched franchised sales model has had on the industry for over half a century.

Rivian is selling directly to customers because, given how new electric vehicle technology is to most Americans, the company wants to ensure consumers understand the product, said James Chen, vice president for public policy.

Lucid, another startup EV automaker, takes a similar stance and is also selling its cars directly to customers through showrooms, often through ""studios"" in shopping malls. Lucid customers can order the cars online in a manner similar to Teslas.

Meanwhile, the industry is also adapting to the age of Internet as even traditional automakers roll out websites to enable online ordering and even purchasing of cars. Delivery of the car to the customers, however, still takes place through a traditional auto dealer.

Adapting to change and incorporating it will be the best way for auto dealers to fight back, said Crane. Instead of fighting the start-ups, they could work with them.

""There needs to be a big multi-stakeholder discussion that leads to some kind of a framework for going forward that allows a lot more flexibility,"" he said. ""It also gives the dealers real hope of being able to be participants going forward.""

308,China silences prominent market analyst as economic slump deepens,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Chinese social media have shut down the accounts of a prominent market analyst who drew attention in recent weeks to the dramatic slowdown in the country's economy and the effects of government policy on the tech industry.

Over the weekend,WeChat froze the public account of Hong Hao, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International, the investment banking arm of Bank of Communications, a state-owned bank and China's fifth largest.

The move came after he posted about huge outflows of capital from the country and made bearish forecasts about the Chinese stock market on social media.

""All content has been blocked. The user is banned from using the account,"" a notice posted on the WeChat account said. It added that the account had ""violated"" government's internet rules, without going into details. It also did not specify which post had led to the suspension.

Hong's account on, which had more than 3 million followers, has also been removed. A search by CNN Business for the account resulted in a message stating that the user ""no longer exists.""

Covid lockdowns have taken a heavy toll on the world's second biggest economy. The latest government survey data — released Saturday — shows activity across manufacturing and services slumping to its lowest level since February 2020.

Beijing's zero-Covid policy, coupled with a crackdown on Big Tech, a real estate slump and risks related to Russia's war in Ukraine, has triggered an unprecedented flight of capital by foreign investors in recent months. The yuan recently plunged to its lowest level in 17 months.

Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co., speaks at the Bloomberg Year Ahead Asia Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017.

Chinese leaders have made repeated reassurances in recent days about fixing the economy. President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for an infrastructure spending spree to promote growth. And the Communist Party's Politburo on Friday promised ""specific measures"" to support the internet economy

Hong and BOCOM International did not respond to requests for comment on the social media suspensions. Weibo didn't reply either.

He's not alone in expressing growing concern about the health of China's economy and markets.

Shan Weijian, founder and chair of Hong Kong-based private equity firm PAG, recently criticized the government for policies that resulted in a ""deep economic crisis,"" according to the Financial Times , citing comments he made at a meeting with brokers. PAG did not respond to a request for comment.

Chinese regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of social media amid rising public discontent over Covid lockdowns in the country.

In a move to reduce people's online anonymity , Weibo told users on Thursday it would start to publish IP locations on their account pages and when they post comments, in a bid to combat ""bad behavior.""

Chinese tech giants have been clamping down on people making negative comments about the economy since last year. In October, Tencent suspended more than 1,400 WeChat accounts after the government launched a crackdown on internet posts that it deems are harmful to the economy.

Tencent said the accounts had made bearish calls about financial markets, ""distorted"" the interpretation of economic policies, or spread rumors. A public account run by Chen Guo, chief strategist for Shenzhen-based Essence Securities, was among them.

Likely trigger for the social media ban?

It's not entirely clear which of Hong Hao's posts triggered the most recent ban.

The last reports posted on his WeChat public account were titled: ""Be wary of capital flight"" and ""What should Chinese ADRs worry about."" ADRs are securities issued by Chinese firms listed in the United States.

Hong warned in those reports about foreign investors dumping Chinese stocks and called attention to the most severe capital outflow since the pandemic began. He also blamed China's tech crackdown, rather than new US rules on listings by foreign companies, for being behind an epic sell-off in Chinese ADRs in March.

In another note on March 21, Hong also predicted the Shanghai Composite would drop below 3,000 points.

Last Monday, the Shanghai Composite fell below 3,000 for the first time in 21 months, as rising Covid-19 cases in Beijing sparked fears that the Chinese capital could join Shanghai and other major cities in lockdown.

311,India's young investors prefer crypto to gold and 'boring' stocks,"New Delhi (CNN Business) Indian businesswoman Swati Daga first bought bitcoin in 2017, when the cryptocurrency was trading well under $3,000. Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family, she recalls.

""The elders in my family told me not to throw my money away,"" said Daga, who runs a food business near New Delhi.

But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision — bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then — and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum.

""I find stock markets boring,"" she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the ""thrill"" and ""recklessness"" that comes with investing in volatile currencies.

She is not the only one.

India has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even flirted with banning them. Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with 750 million users , and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time.

India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than 20 million crypto investors

The growth is driven by younger investors — mostly under the age of 35 — and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business.

According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started ""their investing journey with crypto.""

While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters ""are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,"" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts.

Buying gold is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the World Gold Council . It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies.

Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34.

The CoinDCX app is seen on a phone screen in West Bengal, India, in August 2021.

Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a "" phenomenal year "" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by Binance , one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019.

Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a ""700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.""

Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India.

In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of $68,990 , but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added.

Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base.

Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen ""a massive upside"" in the past 18 months and is ""fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.""

The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women — which is the global trend as well.

On-again, off-again relationship

The excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies.

The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to ""prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.""

rupee in the coming months. This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. Earlier this month , the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digitalrupee in the coming months.

""Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,"" Gupta said at the time of the announcement.

Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry.

WazirX's website is shown in New York, USA, in April 2021.

""I'm getting LinkedIn messages"" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations.

But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country.

""I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. ""Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.""

""I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,"" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India.

""It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.""

Rastogi added that the ""extraordinarily high"" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors.

""This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,"" he said. ""So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.""

For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year.

Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a ""superpower in the next five to 10 years,"" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said.

312,India wants to launch a digital rupee and tax crypto profits,"New Delhi (CNN Business) India is planning to launch a digital version of the rupee, becoming the latest country to join the rush to create state-backed virtual currencies.

The country's central bank expects to introduce the currency ""using blockchain and other technologies"" some time in the new fiscal year, which begins in April, according to Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Presenting India's annual budget to parliament on Tuesday, Sitharaman said the digital rupee would ""give a big boost to the digital economy."" She did not give any further details about what the launch would entail, how widely a digital rupee might be used initially, or what impact it might have.

The announcement comes as other major economies move forward with their own plans to launch virtual versions of their own currencies.

313,India's billionaire vaccine prince held the key to ending the pandemic. His plans went awry,"As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.

Adar Poonawalla — the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker — pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine.

That vaccine, created by Oxford University and, was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work.

""It was a calculated risk,"" Poonawalla told CNN Business. ""But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.""

Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.

To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal.

As the world gave its money — and trust — to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India.

""It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another."" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccine

But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic.

His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations — the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer.

From horse breeders to vaccine makers

It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla.

Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company — which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago — produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII.

The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.

Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets

To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune.

Gates Foundation, which SII other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid byother countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.

All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would ""just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,"" Poonawalla said.

Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.

A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business.

""The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,"" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320

After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII.

India's Covid-19 tsunami

But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher.

At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.

India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.

A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021.

""I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,"" Poonawalla said. ""There was no two ways about that.""

warned India's hold on exports could be "" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example,warned India's hold on exports could be "" catastrophic "" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.

When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options.

At the start of 2021, ""very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it was ""natural"" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size.

But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan.

""Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,"" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

Being held to account

While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling — chief among them, India's massive outbreak — his detractors have questioned parts of his approach.

They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.

""There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,"" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business.

In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020.

But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year.

SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it ""very unreasonable and naive"" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.

The global media coverage also turned unfavorable , with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.

He also insists he was realistic about his goals. ""We always underpromise,"" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver.

Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a "" philanthropic gesture "" — leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.

""AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,"" Aisola said.

According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices.

SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a ""very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world"" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine.

about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October —about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.

SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October.

SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/business/adar-poonawalla-risk-takers/index.html
314,"India's got the next big thing in tech, and it could be worth $1 trillion","New Delhi (CNN Business) More than two decades ago, India began its transformation into a global IT powerhouse , ushering in an era of wealth and job creation never before seen in the country.

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack.

The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, according to a KPMG survey

SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include, SAP Concur and, the American behemoth that owns workplace messaging app Slack

India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a recent report compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders.

There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said.

India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an ""This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,"" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks,India's best-known SaaS company. It filedfor an IPO last month, joining a string of other major Indian tech unicorns that are going public this year.

Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn.

Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. OtherIndian SaaS firmshave found traction by focusing on niche businesses. Zenoti for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry.

Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report.

Bullish investors

Investors are excited about SaaS because of the ""massive adoption"" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India.

Girish Mathrubootham, CEO and founder of Freshworks, a ""SaaS"" or ""Software-as-a-service"" company founded in Chennai, India.

While India is a small player in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them.

Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most sought-after career options in the country.

""India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,"" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies.

Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product.

He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs.

""We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,"" Asthana told CNN Business.

Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion.

International clients, Indian engineers

operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by The low cost ofoperating in India is a big plus. According to a report by consulting firm Bain & Company , the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States.

Abhinav Asthana, CEO and co-founder of Postman in India.

""If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,"" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. ""When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.""

similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and Infosys INFY since most of India's oldest unicorns — from Flipkart to Paytm — have focused primarily on the domestic market. Most SaaS companies focus on global clients,similar to the strategy that was followed byIndia'sIT giants such as TCS and. Investors see this as a welcome change,since most of India's oldest unicorns — from Flipkart to Paytm — have focusedprimarily on the domestic market.

Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia.

SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times.

""For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,"" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere — they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory.

Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs ""mastered"" the art of ""remote sales"" fairly early. ""Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,"" he added.

Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise.

Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company.

In IT services, ""you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,"" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added.

And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a ""global tech powerhouse product brand.""

But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that.

315,2021 was a dramatic year for Indian IPOs. The hype won't go away next year,"New Delhi (CNN Business) India's stock market celebrated an extraordinary year as some of the country's buzziest tech firms made their public debuts. And while one high-profile blunder cast a chill over the festivities, that's probably not enough to stop the excitement in 2022.

By December, more than $15 billion had been raised in Mumbai through initial public offerings, a record amount, according to Dealogic. About $6 billion, or nearly 40%, went to tech companies — another record.

This year was historic for another big reason: It's the first time any of India's tech unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion, have gone public.

Those milestones indicate how much of a shift happened this year for tech darlings tapping investment in Asia's third largest economy. India's unicorns have in the past focused on exclusively raising funds from private markets , fearing that the country's conservative investors would not understand their business models.

Most of these high-profile startups are losing money, which was making retail investors leery, Piyush Nagda, head of investment products at Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, told CNN Business.

But that all changed after food delivery giant Zomato made its red hot debut this summer. Nagda said the IPO sent a clear signal that ""perception is changing"" among investors.

The party that started with Zomato's $1.3 billion IPO — the company popped 65% on listing day to reach a market value of $13 billion — swept up a handful of other tech firms as well. E-commerce company Nykaa and online insurance marketplace Policybazaar each surged on their debuts.

came to a screeching halt with The euphoriacame to a screeching halt with Paytm's disastrous IPO last month. The mammoth listing from the digital payments firm crashed 27% on its first day of trading, and hasn't come close to reaching its offer price again.

Despite that fiasco, which analysts blamed on the lack of a clear pathway to profitability and an overly high valuation, other Indian tech firms likely won't be stopped from going public in the coming years. They'll just have to be careful about how they price themselves and whether they're buying too much into the hype.

Why the party could keep going

There are a few reasons to remain hopeful about the Indian tech sector.

Many of the country's digital startups saw a big jump in growth during the pandemic, both in terms of customers and funding.

Coronavirus-related lockdowns have encouraged people outside of major cities to spend money online, speeding up digitization of businesses and opening up more opportunities for technology entrepreneurs.

Tech firms in India have raised nearly $25 billion this year, the highest annual amount ever, according to data platform Tracxn. Some 34 companies have reached unicorn status.

India has also attracted more attention from top global investors this year due to the crackdown on tech firms in China , where authorities have imposed sweeping curbs on private enterprise that have eaten into share prices and triggered concerns about future growth.

As a result of those regulatory actions, ""growth investors have shifted funds to India"" said Tom Masi and Nuno Fernandes, co-portfolio managers of the emerging wealth strategy at GW&K Investment Management. They told CNN Business that the performances of the two countries have diverged this year, ""with India up about 20% and China down 20%.""

Nagda also said that interest in Indian tech from global investors has made the sector more attractive to India's tech-savvy millennials. He estimates that India added about 20 million retail investors since April 2020, and between 30% to 40% of them are under the age of 40.

They've been piling into the stock market since the pandemic started, and are eager to invest in the country's internet giants, he added.

And, they should be getting plenty of opportunities next year, with some of India's biggest startups gearing up for IPOs, including Walmart-owned Flipkart and hotel chain OYO

Young investors don't look at companies in a ""traditional"" manner ""where profitability and those kind of ratios were heavily looked at,"" Nagda said, adding that there is a ""revolutionary change"" underway in stock trading in India.

A wake-up call

Even those investors may have their limit, though.

Paytm raised $2.5 billion during its IPO, with almost half of that coming from foreign investors.

The company was valued at $20 billion when it launched its public offering — even though it lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seemed far from ready to turn a profit.

""Paytm was overpriced,"" said Masi and Fernandes. ""It required investors to make growth assumptions well into the future for a business model that has not been firmly established.""

Some analysts describe Paytm's flop as a much-needed wake-up call for companies that need to rethink their valuations.

""Some rationality will prevail,"" Nagda said. To see Zomato-like ""success stories,"" you need to ""price the stock rightly,"" he added.

After Paytm's historically terrible debut, some companies in fintech sector are rethinking their IPOs. Paytm's smaller rival Mobikwik said it would defer its IPO, originally planned for November, by a few months.

""The company is witnessing strong business growth, has a clear path to profitability and will list at the right time,"" it told CNN Business.

Some tech entrepreneurs have urged caution while chasing big money in public markets.

Zerodha, Nithin Kamath, founder of India's largest retail brokerageZerodha, tweeted recently that his firm won't be filing for an IPO, even though he ""can potentially get ridiculous valuations.""

""We are in a world where companies are getting priced to perfection based on all the future growth potential. For a stock to do well, you have to outperform,"" he wrote. ""As CEO, I dread to think how you can outperform the already really high expectations that growth companies have today.""

Along with managing overwhelming expectations, startups that go public will also have to adjust to the amount of company information they'd be expected to regularly reveal to their new shareholders.

Privately held tech giants are less beholden to such transparency. And many investors think those requirements would be a welcome change.

There will be ""visibility into this for the very, very first time,"" said Karthik Reddy, co-founder of venture capital firm Blume Ventures. ""Even I don't know what was going on in all these companies, even though I'm an industry person.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/22/investing/india-tech-ipos-2021-2022/index.html
316,Buffett says Berkshire's success is more about being 'sane' than 'smart',"New York (CNN Business) Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has beaten the broader market so far this year. But the Oracle of Omaha wasn't willing to declare himself an investing genius during Saturday's annual shareholder meeting.

Buffett simply said that thestrategy is all about making rational decisions and investing for the long haul.

""It's not because we're smart. It's because we're sane,"" Buffett said during the meeting ofinvestors.

Buffett brushed off compliments from one questioner about how he times the stock market so well. Buffett said that he never really knows what stocks or the economy will do in the short-term.

He also joked that his bullish bets on the market often look bad at first, saying that he spent a big portion of his net worth in 2008 during the Great Recession buying stocks at ""a terrible time ... a really dumb time."" Berkshire made investments inand, among other blue chips, before the market finally bottomed in March 2009.

""We have never timed anything,"" Buffett said, adding that the success of the company's long-term ""buy and hold"" investment strategy is ""simple.""

Both Buffett and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger lamented how speculators have seemingly taken over Wall Street. Munger described the casino-like atmosphere and Buffett called the market a ""gambling parlor.""

Worries about inflation but praise for Powell

Buffett didn't talk at great length during the meeting about this year's market volatility. But he did say that inflation is a big problem, one that ""swindles almost everybody.""

And he gave big plaudits to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for his actions to battle the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, even though some argue that the Fed's low rates have helped fuel inflation pressures.

Buffett said Powell was a ""hero"" for being aggressive and quickly slashing rates at the start of the pandemic instead of sitting by and ""thumb sucking.""

Buffett also hinted that Berkshire could take advantage of sell-offs, saying that the firm ""depends"" upon market behavior creating mispriced opportunities for the company.

Activision's stock price is below the proposed takeover price. Buffett said that he made the decision to buy more of the stock as an ""arbitrage"" bet that the deal will eventually get done.

These moves come just a few weeks after Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter that he was having difficulty finding stocks to buy at attractive prices. But following the Berkshire buying binge, its cash on hand has fallen from about $147 billion at the end of 2021 to around $106 billion at the end of the first quarter.

317,Elon Musk sells $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares,"New York (CNN Business) Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold $8.5 billion of the electric automaker's stock in the three days after the Twitter board agreed to sell the company to him.

Musk sold 3.7 million shares of Tesla stock on Tuesday, for a total of $3.3 billion, and another 735,000 shares on Wednesday, bringing in $654 million, according to filings he made with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday.

Friday morning he disclosed that he had sold an additional 5.2 million shares for a total of $4.5 billion. All told, he received an average price of $883.09 per share.

The sales represent only 5.6% of the Tesla shares he held outright at the start of the day Tuesday, and less than 4% of his total holdings of Tesla if stock options he controls are included.

The filings do not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appears to be raising funds to buy Twitter.

In a tweet Thursday evening, after the initial filings but before the disclosure of Thursday's sales, Musk said, ""No further TSLA sales planned after today.""

Company insiders, such as Musk, must report purchases or sales of their company's stock to the SEC to inform the broader investment community of their activity. But they have a couple of days to make that filing and still comply with the rules.

Musk's sales of Tesla shares were large enough to sink the company's stock price. The 3.7 million shares sold on Tuesday represented 17% of the normal daily trading value in Tesla shares so far this year before Tuesday. Tesla shares lost 12.2% of their value during the course of trading Tuesday, the biggest one-day drop in the company's stock since September 2020. The stock's decline prompted a selling spree by other investors, as 45 million shares traded hands -- about twice the volume of trades from the day before.

Tesla investors could also have sold shares this week out of concern that Musk would be unable to give as much time and attention to Tesla . The company has ambitious growth plans and growing competition.

Shares of Tesla hardly changed Wednesday and Thursday. The stock was up 3% in early afternoon trading Friday, as his tweet apparently assured investors that his sales were complete.

""How much he's going to have to sell now appears to be known. That's the reason for the bounce in the stock,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures. ""I actually thought he'd have to sell more shares than this.""

But Tesla shares are still down nearly 18% since the day before Musk revealed he became Twitter's largest shareholder . The uncertainty of what the Twitter deal will mean for Tesla and Musk's commitment to the company has become an overhang on Tesla's stock, said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.

""Besides the distraction issues, it brings the circus-like situation back into a Tesla story that has nothing to do with Tesla,"" said Ives. The uncertainty about the Twitter deal -- shares are trading about 8% below the agreed-upon purchase price -- only adds to the uncertainty for what Musk will do with his Tesla shares, Ives said.

""He says it's the end and that makes me believe it likely is,"" Ives said. ""But the Street will be watching closely to see if it truly is the end.""

Musk is expected to use his massive Tesla holdings as a way to finance his purchase of Twitter. But that doesn't mean he needs to sell all his shares to raise the full purchase price. Instead he can use the shares as collateral for loans to raise the cash

But there are limits to how much money he can raise simply by pledging his Tesla shares as collateral. He can raise more money by selling some portion of his Tesla shares. Tesla corporate rules state that officers and directors of the company can raise only 25% of the value of the stock being pledged as collateral.

As of June 30, 2021, company filings show Musk already pledged 88.3 million of his Tesla shares as collateral, but those shares were pledged years ago when Tesla shares were worth a small fraction of their current value. He would likely be able to borrow more money even against some of those shares.

Even if Musk doesn't use those shares as collateral, the estimated 67 million unpledged shares that he owns after this week's sales could be used to borrow nearly $17 billion — even with the recent decline in Tesla's share price.

But Munster said Musk probably doesn't want to go right up to that maximum, because if Tesla stock falls further he could be forced to sell some shares in the future.

""This is a pretty volatile stock. It's up 10 times in value in just the past few years. Those stocks can go back down,"" he said.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the initial number of Tesla shares Elon Musk sold, the value of the shares, and when he sold them.

318,Venmo owner PayPal is one of the worst stocks of 2022,"New York (CNN Business) Sending money to pay for things via Venmo may be all the rage among smartphone-addicted millennials and Gen Zers. But it hasn't been enough to boost Venmo owner PayPal as of late. The digital payments giant is one of the worst performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Shares have plunged more than 55% so far in 2022.

warned back in February that its sales and new active user growth would be below forecasts. Chief financial officer John Rainey said the combination of inflationary pressures, supply chain issues and the lack of any new stimulus from the federal government was hurting consumer sentiment and spending.

PayPal reported its first quarter results after the closing bell Wednesday. Sales grew 8% from a year ago, slightly ahead of forecasts. Year-over-year earnings dropped sharply and guidance was below estimates. The stock was up a bit after hours.

Making matters worse for PayPal is the fact that Rainey is planning to soon leave the company after seven years there. The tech firm surprised Wall Street earlier this month when it announced that Rainey is going to become the new CFO atand will be leaving PayPal at the end of May.

PayPal in Wall Street's penalty box

The company is looking for a permanent replacement. But until one is found, Gabrielle Rabinovitch, PayPal's senior vice president, corporate finance and investor relations, will be interim CFO.

""PayPal is in an awkward kind of purgatory with John Rainey leaving,"" said Andrew Bauch, senior analyst with SMBC Nikko Securities America.

Investors are also nervous that the company may need to lower its outlook again.

""This seems like a situation where current management may need to reset the guidance further in order to set the bar lower for when a new CFO comes in,"" said Jordan Kahn, chief investment officer of ACM Funds.

Kahn said his firm sold PayPal shares in January before the last earnings report due to concerns about growth. But he still likes the long-term prospects for the stock and said he's waiting for the right moment to potentially get back in.

Another concern? Consumers are starting to go back to brick and mortar retailers to shop as fears about Covid subside thanks to vaccinations and less lethal — albeit more transmissible — variants of the virus.

That means that consumers may look to make more purchases with credit and debit cards or cash in physical stores and make fewer digital payments for online shopping, said Christopher Vecchio, senior strategist at DailyFX.

As digital payment rivalry grows, should PayPal do a deal?

Block SQ Bank of America BAC JPMorgan Chase JPM Competition is intensifying as well and it's not helping. PayPal and Venmo are in a fierce battle for users with the likes of, the parent company of Square and Cash App, as well as Zelle , the fintech owned by a consortium of seven of the country's top banks, includingand

PayPal could benefit, though, if Block CEO Jack Dorsey looks to become more involved with Twitter in the wake of Elon Musk's acquisition. Dorsey used to be CEO of both companies and some believe that a distracted Dorsey was good for PayPal.

""If Dorsey were to become a part-time CEO who was back at Twitter, that could help PayPal and open up the door for them to gain ground,"" Vecchio said.

Kahn agreed that Dorsey focusing more on Twitter would be ""great for PayPal"" but he thinks that is unlikely to happen. Which means PayPal will have to work harder to revitalize user growth.

Pinterest PINS Its sluggish prospects could push the company to look towards more acquisitions to rejuvenate sales and earnings. Late last year, there was speculation that PayPal was looking to buy social media firm, but PayPal has said no deal is in the works.

Some analysts also have suggested that PayPal could make a play for struggling online brokerage Robinhood , which just announced layoffs Tuesday. Bauch said he would not be surprised to see PayPal try to engage in ""some creative M&A"" in order to boost growth.

The question is whether PayPal investors, which have firmly put the stock in Wall Street's penalty box, would approve.

But Kahn said the good news is that following this year's market slide, most fintech companies are in the same boat as PayPal. That means they are all a lot cheaper — and potentially ripe for a takeover.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/investing/paypal-stock-earnings/index.html
319,Boeing delays its newest jet as losses soar,"New York (CNN Business) The bad news keeps piling up for Boeing. The company is delaying the debut of its newest passenger jet to 2025, and it reported a much bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.

The aircraft builder announced Wednesday it would temporarily pause the start of production for its 777X passenger jet, which it planned to start delivering to customers by the end of 2023. Demand for long-range and widebody passenger jets, a key to Boeing's commercial jet business, continues to be hurt by weak demand for international flights during the pandemic.

But Boeing attributed much of the delay to a longer certification process by the Federal Aviation Administration than in the past. Boeing said it didn't want to start production before the certification process was complete or near complete and then have to a large inventory of planes that required changes before it could deliver them.

""They take a little longer than they used to,"" CEO Dave Calhoun said about regulators during a call with investors. ""They're a little more thorough than they used to. Boeing is better for it in the long run.""

Demand for Boeing's freighter aircraft has remained strong, so it will go forward with the recently launched 777X freighter before it starts production of the 777X passenger jet. Boeing will continue to build both the earlier passenger and freighter versions of its 777 jet, known as the 777 Classic. Those models are due to be replaced by the 777X.

320,China may be getting ready to wind down its crackdown on big tech,"New Delhi (CNN Business) Shares of Chinese tech companies soared on Friday after Beijing signaled that it may throw the beleagured industry a lifeline and promised again to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 4%, while the Shanghai Composite was up 2.4%, after Chinese state media reported that the country's top leaders had vowed to boost growth.

They also promised to ""promote the healthy development"" of the internet economy and ""introduce specific measures"" to support the sector, the Communist Party's Politburo said Friday, according to state-run Xinhua News Agency.

The pledge follows a sweeping crackdown on some of the country's biggest private enterprises that began in 2020 when the government slammed the brakes on Ant Group's plan to go public at the last minute.

Analysts took Friday's statement as a sign that the government may dial back its dramatic regulatory offensive, which has slammed industries ranging from tech and finance to gaming, entertainment and private education.

321,These apps are trying to put car dealers out of business,"London (CNN Business) City dwellers are used to switching between apps to decide the best way to get from A to B. Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter?

It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars.

""Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,"" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business.

According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for 24% of global energy-related CO2 emissions , most of which come from passenger vehicles . If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen.

Car competition

He admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. ""The car represents freedom of mobility,"" says Hietanen — even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a ""freedom insurance.""

To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters).

The app was launched in Helsinki but is now available in several European and Asian cities.

Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs €62 ($73) in Helsinki — where the app is most established — for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from €55 ($65) per day.

While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city ""does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place"" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London.

She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm MarketsandMarkets predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030.

MaaS movement

BP BP Mitsubishi MBFJF Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such asand Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch.

But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities.

According to Whim, public transport and micromobility are the most popular ways to travel using the app.

money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat recently reported that the company had spent €50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says themoney was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app.

""We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,"" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment.

Greener travel

Though the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A recent report from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, ""people must choose it over other travel options"" such as private motor vehicles.

This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. ""People want the more sustainable solution,"" he says, ""but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/business/whim-app-helsinki-spc-intl/index.html
322,"Electric robots are mapping the seafloor, Earth's last frontier","(CNN Business) For centuries, humans have explored the Earth's mountains, jungles and deserts. But despite covering more than 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about the sea floor; just over 20% of the ocean bed has been mapped.

Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the ""blue economy,"" projected to be worth $3 trillion by 2030.

Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea.

A five-year-old startup called Seatrec is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing ""the naturally occurring temperature difference"" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business.

Greener and cheaper

The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite.

Seatrec's float uses differences in ocean temperature to power itself.

As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator.

""They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,"" Chao said.

A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said.

But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range.

Picking up the pace

New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project

""One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,"" said McMichael-Phillips. ""Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.""

Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade.

Some companies, such as XOCEAN , are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform.

Bedrock Ocean Exploration uses an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers.

The challenge ahead

Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge.

Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised $2 million in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system.

But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be ""somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,"" according to McMichael-Phillips -- ""pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.""

Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet.

""If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,"" he said, ""we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/26/tech/seatrec-bedrock-robot-seabed-mapping-climate-spc-hnk/index.html

325,Two dead in new Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo,"(CNN) Health authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo are scrambling to contain an Ebola outbreak after a second person died from the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday.

The country declared a new outbreak of the disease last week after the death of a 31-year-old man, who was diagnosed with the disease in Mbandaka, in the DRC's northwestern Equateur Province, after being sick for more than a week. His sister-in-law, a 25-year-old woman, was the second victim. She died on April 25.

""This is very sad news, and we must continue to put all our effort into saving the lives of anyone else who may have contracted the virus. So far, at least 145 people have been listed as contacts,"" Dr. Fiona Braka, the team lead for emergency responses at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, said in a statement sent to CNN.

The conflict in northern Ethiopia broke out in Tigray between the TPLF and the forces of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed 's central government in November 2020, and spilled over into neighboring regions. The TPFL expanded into Afar last year.

The spokesperson, Getachew Reda, said that the Ethiopian government and regional authorities were using the TPLF's presence in Afar as an excuse to block humanitarian relief there, and other neighboring regions, an accusation they deny.

""Now that excuse has gone, we can expect humanitarian needs to be accessed,"" Reda said.

327,Meet three Black climbers taking representation to new heights on summits across Africa and around the world,"(CNN) — Andrew Alexander King will never forget the first time he took on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest peak and the world's largest freestanding mountain, in 2018.

But it wasn't the summit that surprised the climber. It was the greeting he received when he came down, as local mountain guides gathered around him in a celebratory dance.

""It turns out they were excited because they'd never seen an African American climb,"" he tells CNN. ""And I was kind of just blown away by that.""

According to the American Alpine Club's inaugural 2019 State of Climbing report only 1% of surveyed climbers identified as Black. ""No one should be surprised to hear that climbing is dominated by White men,"" outdoor guide and author James Edward Mills wrote in the forward of the report; of the club members surveyed, 85% were White and 72% male.

While this is a US-based poll, and the first of its kind, the lack of non-White climbers is seen and felt worldwide -- from Mt. Kilimanjaro to Mt. Everest.

CNN recently spoke with King and two other Black climbers on what it will take to make the sport more diverse and inclusive across Africa and beyond.

The trailblazing mountaineer

Saray N'kusi Khumalo - CEO, Summits with a Purpose

Sarah N'kusi Khumalo became the first Black African woman to summit Everest in 2019.

Near-death accidents and summit failures have not slowed down mountaineer Saray N'kusi Khumalo. The Zambian-born mother of two holds a corporate job, hosts a podcast, has climbed some of the tallest mountains around the world -- and still has the time to run a non-profit that focuses on education in Africa.

""My grandfather always used to say, 'if you don't live a life of service, that's a life wasted,'"" she tells CNN.

In 2013, she founded Summits with a Purpose in South Africa -- with every climb, she raises funds to help build schools and libraries.

Saray N'kusi Khumalo “I'm not going to just climb and take a selfie. I'm going to climb and then make a difference.”

Khumalo's climbs are also making a difference in the name of diversity. After she successfully completed her first big summit in 2012 -- Mt. Kilimanjaro -- Khumalo knew she was meant to be a mountaineer. And while she took note of the lack of diversity in her sport -- ""very much White-male-dominated,"" she says -- she never let that discourage her.

""I am an African, a very proud African when I'm on the mountain. And I'm told that the (other climbers) don't think that I belong,"" Khumalo says. ""I make sure that (when) they see an African, somebody that looks like me, they remember that we are capable.""

As the first Black African woman to summit Everest, Saray Khumalo believes the only way up is to pay it forward. Through her organization, Summits with a Purpose, she helps bring education to communities in South Africa.

Not long after her first-ever summit, she turned her eyes toward the world's tallest peak: Mt. Everest, located in the Himalayas.

The first three attempts were grueling and heartbreaking for Khumalo: she experienced everything from natural disasters to losing consciousness in the "" death zone ,"" Everest's top stretch over 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) above sea level, where oxygen is dangerously low.

""I have a love/hate relationsship with Everest,"" Khumalo recounts. ""I don't know if it was my greatest achievement more than just getting myself up every time I fell.""

She's currently working on completing the Explorers Grand Slam, the quest to summit the seven highest mountains in the world and reach both the North and South Poles. To date, she has accomplished five of the summits.

Khumalo is humbled by what she's achieved so far, but she notes, ""I don't think that I've broken those stereotypes yet; there's still a lot more work to be done,"" adding that representation should extend beyond the mountain tops, too.

""It's not just about Everest; representation ... is a gift that we need to leave for the next generation wherever we are,"" she says, calling on her peers to step outside their comfort zone to show that Black people belong in all spaces.

Andrew Alexander King - CEO, The Between Worlds Project

Andrew Alexander King is a Black American mountaineer aiming to tackle some of the world's largest peaks as well as increase representation on the rock. Andrew Alexander King

Andrew Alexander King says the first mountain he ever climbed was getting out of the projects in Detroit, Michigan.

Today, the avid explorer says he's climbed over 66 mountains. His long term goal is to climb the 14 highest mountain and volcano peaks on each continent. If he accomplishes this, he'll be the first Black man to do so. But that's not his motivation.

""If an individual does not see themselves at the top of Everest, at the top of Kilimanjaro ... they will not pursue that because they will feel that subconsciously they do not belong,"" he says.

When King began climbing more seriously in his twenties, he says, ""the lack of diversity was very pronounced"" and he had a heightened awareness of being the only Black person on the mountain. While climbing Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in South America, he says he was the only Black person on the expedition team -- despite it being a diverse group.

""There (were) a lot of racial jokes and tension and I had to stand up for myself,"" he recalls, adding that people assumed he didn't have the aptitude for handling a tough climb.

""It did make me feel insecure, but I also use that insecurity as my rocket fuel to keep moving forward to break through that glass ceiling,"" King says.

Seven years ago he founded The Between Worlds Project , which aims to help the communities where he climbs. With each expedition he goes on, he works with local non-profits on issues they are facing such as sexism, racism, climate change and inequality.

When CNN spoke with King, he was on his way back home from a two-month trip in Tanzania and Kenya where he had been volunteering in an orphanage, working with the Moving Mountains Trust and climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya alongside locals.

""The seeds that we're planting are going to grow -- I will probably not see it in my lifetime, but we have to start planting it and nurturing it now,"" King says of increasing representation. ""Diversity in outdoor sports is an issue that we have to tackle together.""

The barefoot climber

Peter Naituli - Rock climber

Peter Naituli is a free solo-ing, bare foot rock climber from Kenya.

Peter Naituli is a Kenyan rock climber known for scaling mountains in his bare feet.

Without experienced climbers to guide him when he was growing up, he said he dove right into the riskier aspects of climbing -- including free-soloing, which is climbing without a safety system. Through his remarkable physical feats, like climbing Mount Kenya without a rope or footwear, Naituli is proving Kenya's place in the climbing world.

""(As a kid) one thing that was a bit boring in my climbing is I didn't have anyone else sharing the passion with,"" he tells CNN. ""It was just me trying to keep the fire alive.""

In 2021, Naituli was featured in the documentary ""Cold Feet,"" with the intention of showcasing Kenya as a climbing mecca, in the hopes that it'll help grow the local industry -- and dispel the notion that climbing is a White sport.

""It's not just a Western activity, it's something here in the country, and just by watching someone else do it, (Kenyans) can have something to live up to,"" he says.

Peter Naituli explains ""free solo"" climbing and his barefoot journey up Mount Kenya.

Non-profits such as Climbing Life Kenya and Mountain Club of Kenya are making climbing more accessible and reducing the barriers to participate. In 2012, Climb BlueSky -- the first public climbing gym in East Africa -- opened its doors in Nairobi.

Still, Naituli says he'd like to see more gyms and increased access for climbing in Kenya, noting that the talent exists, but the opportunities do not.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/africa-black-mountain-climbers-diversity-spc-intl/index.html

This is the third outbreak in the province since 2018 and the 14th Ebola outbreak for the country since 1976, the WHO said

""Time is not on our side,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. ""The disease has had a two-week head start and we are now playing catch-up.

The man was admitted to an Ebola treatment center on April 21 for intensive care but died later that day, the WHO said.

Health workers recognized the symptoms of Ebola and ""immediately"" submitted samples for testing, WHO said. ""Efforts to stem the current outbreak are already underway,"" the organization said, and vaccinations will start in the coming days.

331,Former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki dies at 90,"(CNN) Mwai Kibaki, one of the biggest names in Kenyan politics and the nation's third president, has died, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced. He was 90.

His political career spanned decades, including serving as vice president to Daniel arap Moi , the man he replaced as president of the East African nation in 2002.

But he was also at the helm during the most violent election in the country's history, when more than 1,200 people died in bloody ethnic battles after disputed 2007 polls.

Kibaki's death was confirmed in a statement issued by Kenyatta, who said the country would observe a period of national mourning from Friday until his burial.

Kenyatta paid tribute to Kibaki as ""the gentleman of Kenyan politics"" and recalled ""his dignity, his diligence, candor, and concern for the well-being of all Kenyans.""

""Kibaki was a quintessential patriot whose legacy of civic responsibility will continue to inspire generations of Kenyans long into our future,"" Kenyatta said.

Kenya's then-President Mwai Kibaki delivers his speech during the national celebrations to mark the 49th Jamhuri Day, the day when Kenya gained independence, at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi December 12, 2012.

Ties broken with his predecessor

When Kibaki was first elected in 2002, the outgoing president had ruled Kenya since 1978, and was forced by the constitution to step down. Moi ceded power in a peaceful ceremony rarely seen in many African nations at the time. Gleeful Kenyans danced on the streets while others climbed trees and lamp posts to celebrate Kibaki's win.

After decades of Moi's autocratic rule, many described the scenes as reminiscent of the celebrations following Kenya's independence from Britain in 1963.

Kibaki was Kenya's finance minister through the 1970s under Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's founding president. He later became vice president in the 1980s under Moi, but broke ties with him as his government became mired in corruption scandals and economic problems.

In the 1990s, Kibaki formed the Democratic Party, then considered the main opposition against the ruling KANU party -- a monumental move in a country that had been served by a single party since independence. He helped galvanize a group of politicians and opposition parties disgruntled by Moi's leadership. That group turned out to be his greatest asset, and helped propel him to power in 2002.

During his presidential campaign, he pledged to tackle corruption, boost the economy and rebuild the nation. After he won, he set the tone for the new era with a blunt rebuke of his predecessor.

""Fellow Kenyans, I am inheriting a country which has been badly ravaged by years of misrule and ineptitude,"" Kibaki said during his first inauguration as a stone-faced Moi sat nearby. ""There has been a wide disconnect between the people and the government, between people's aspirations and the government's attitude toward them.""

But while Kibaki initially waged a war on corruption, one of the nation's biggest graft scandals was under his tenure. The multimillion-dollar Anglo Leasing case , which emerged two years after he took office, involved public cash being doled out to a complicated web of companies for a range of services -- some of which were never delivered.

Despite the scandals, however, Kibaki also made major changes to public facilities, including introducing free basic education for children and revamping health care facilities. He was reelected to two terms and served as president until 2013.

Mwai Kibaki arrives for the inauguration of his successor Uhuru Kenyatta at Kasarani, near Nairobi in Kenya, on April 9, 2013.

Post-election bloodshed

When Kibaki was elected to a second term in 2007, the opposition decried the poll as rigged. It rejected the results and vowed to inaugurate the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, as president. The government deployed soldiers as supporters of the ruling party and the opposition took to the streets, sparking violence that left many dead.

The bloodshed stunned the world. Until then, Kenya enjoyed a reputation as one of the most stable nations in Africa. A stunned world watched as the country with a powerhouse economy and one of the most lucrative tourism industries in the region plunged into violence and uncertainty.

An intervention by the United Nations helped broker a peace deal, but Kenya lost its sheen as a model democracy.

Two years before the end of his second term, the nation's famed tourist industry suffered major setbacks as Al-Shabaab militants from neighboring Somalia started attacking tourists in Kenya. Kibaki deployed the military into Somalia, sparking tensions between the two countries.

Early years

Kibaki was born on November 15, 1931 in Nyeri, on the slopes of Mount Kenya.

During his youth, he learned carpentry and masonry, and would help repair furniture at the boarding schools he attended. After graduating from the high-achieving Mangu High School in Kenya, he went to the prestigious Makerere University in Uganda -- at the time described as the ""Harvard University of Africa.""

He studied economics and political science at Makerere, and also served as the vice president of the student union. He later attended the London School of Economics, where he earned a bachelor's degree in public finance. He returned to his alma mater, Makerere, and taught in the economics department.

Kibaki quit his job as a professor to join politics, serving in roles including member of parliament and minister of commerce, as well as finance minister. He was appointed vice president in 1978 -- when Moi took over the reins following the death of Kenyatta.

Kibaki had unsuccessfully vied for the presidency twice, in 1991 and 1997, before he was finally elected.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/africa/kenya-mwai-kibaki-obit-intl/index.html
332,She defied the odds to lead the first all-women fishing cooperative. Now they stand to lose it all,"This story is part of As Equals , CNN's ongoing series on gender inequality. For information about how the series is funded and more, check out our FAQs .

Binga, Zimbabwe (CNN) The Zambezi River is one of the largest bodies of water in Africa. It rises in Zambia, then it curves, snake-like on its 2,500km journey first to the west through Angola, skimming Namibia and Botswana, then flowing south along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, before finally running eastward through Mozambique, heading for the ocean.

Along the Zambezi's route to the Indian Ocean, where it feeds the man-made Lake Kariba, is Binga district, Zimbabwe, formed to house the Tonga people who were forcefully removed when their land was flooded to build the Lake. In Sebungwe Mouth, one of the villages in Binga, Brandina Mundimba is using a reed known locally as malala to weave a basket which, when complete, will be transported to the market along with the rest and sold for 1500 Zimbabwean dollars (Z$) ($4).

This is how 40-year-old Mundimba and the other members of her fishing cooperative have been scraping together a living since their fishing rig broke down last October. Other teams resumed fishing ""but we could not because our fishing rig's engine needed attention,"" she says.

Mundimba and the other members of the all-women Bbindauko Banakazi Kapenta Fishing Cooperative have given so much, risked so much to get this far. They have worked hard to leave behind the ""woman's work"" of weaving malala reeds under the scorching sun and instead fish for kapenta -- a type of anchovy -- but they now face multiple challenges.

On top of the stress of a defective rig, the women are seeing fish stocks dwindle due to the effects of climate change and overfishing.

'Our husbands thought the cooperative would lead us into infidelity'

The story of the Bbindauko Banakazi cooperative started off as the opportunity of a lifetime.

In 2011 a local charity, Zubo Trust, used a grant from UN Women to build a fishing rig with a cylindrical metal base that allows it to float, a shade made of aluminum sheets, and an exposed bulb fixed to some metal poles that hold black nets, which attracts the kapenta during the night when the nets are lowered under the water.

Importantly, the rig also comes with its own toilet, bath and built-in sleeping area. Fishermen typically relieve themselves in the open and bathe on the banks of the Zambezi, and it's these practices that contribute to the sense that fishing isn't viable work for women.

Once the rig was ready, the trust selected 10 women from about 80 who sold fish in the market but expressed interest in learning to catch the fish instead, and provided them with the necessary training. Zubo also set out to convince the husbands of the newly trained fisherwomen that letting their wives leave their homes at night to fish was not as bad as it sounded.

""It took Zubo Trust to hold a series of workshops with our husbands to sensitize them...to allow us to go out at night,"" says Sinikiwe Mwinde, one of the founding members of the Bbindauko Banakazi cooperative.

""Our husbands thought the cooperative would lead us into infidelity,"" the mother of three adds as she rubs her head using the palm of her left hand, a little embarrassed.

Other than the rig, Zubo helped the women set up a harbor on the river in nearby Simatelele, where they would dock their boat, and created an elevated platform made from wooden poles and black nets where the women would dry their catch before packing it into bags for sale.

The formation of the first all-women fishing co-operative in Binga drew much attention. The Ministry of Women Affairs came down for the official launch on International Women's Day in March 2012 and the tradition-defying project has received both local and international media coverage. But no one was more excited than the cooperative's members and their husbands.

""With time changing I felt as a family we should shun such archaic practices. Women should be empowered. I am proud that my wife is a fisher."" Lawrence Mukuli

""During my father's time, women were not allowed to play roles such as fishing which were reserved for men,"" says Lawrence Mukuli, Mundimba's husband. ""With time changing I felt as a family we should shun such archaic practices. Women should be empowered. I am proud that my wife is a fisher.""

""The money we were getting from the fish market was less compared to the money that we could get if we become fishers with our own rig,"" says founding member Mwinde, speaking of the hopes they all had that the fishing business would change their lives and their communities.

The cooperative has evolved over the years and seen members leave and new ones join, including Mundimba who joined in 2015.

Selling fish wholesale may pay more than selling baskets, but artisanal kapenta fishing is equally hard work and demanding on families.

Four women go out at a time, leaving their children in the care of their husbands for 22 days each month. The other four women go the following month.

Once the fish are sold, the team of four divide up their profits after paying for annual licensing fees, equipment maintenance and the three men who work for them: two to operate their rig, and a third to work as a security guard, ensuring that their catch isn't stolen as it is being dried.

Life improved for a while. Up until 2017, Mundimba and the team began to acquire property and livestock, which in turn gave them greater economic power where previously all assets had been owned by men.

""[Every month] we would catch between 28 to 30 bags of kapenta,"" Mundimba says. At its peak, each bag of fish weighing 30kg could fetch prices as high as Z$45,000 ($124) resulting in an income of Z$1,350,000 ($3,730) a month -- to be divided by four. This monthly income is a lot of money for most people in a nation where civil servants such as teachers earn an average salary of Z$28,00 ($80) a month.

""In 2015, I built a shop to sell groceries and clothing. I have also been able to meet the educational needs of my children because of this fishing business,"" says Mwinde of what she did with her earnings.

But the prosperous times didn't last.

'Climate change is heavily affecting freshwater ecosystems'

When CNN visited the cooperative's permanent harbor at Simatelele, the once busy hub where the women dried and packaged kapenta is now a shadow of its former self. Some of the buildings and the drying platforms have fallen into disrepair from lack of use. The whole place looks desolate.

The women can no longer fish on this part of the river as the waters have become too shallow, forcing them to dock their rig further along the banks, more than 50 kilometers away.

Zimbabwe has long experienced droughts, the worst being in recent years being the 2015-2016 El Niño which had devastating effects across most of Southern Africa . There have also been many extreme weather events -- both floods and droughts -- in recent years, says Selusiwe Sibanda, public relations and communications manager at the Zambezi River Authority, whose mandate is to maintain Lake Kariba and its reservoir.

""There was a period of below-average flows recorded during the 2015-2016 rainfall season...[and] during the 2018-2019 rainfall season,"" says Sibanda who is based in Lusaka, Zambia.

""Before, water was abundant. These days I can even see that the water levels are low. This makes it difficult for us to have a lucrative catch,"" Mundimba says in a somber voice.

Andrew Chamisa, a deputy director in the Zimbabwe Department of Livestock Research and Fisheries in the Ministry of Lands, says warmer waters due to climate change are also heavily affecting fish stocks due to changes in physical, chemical and biological processes in these freshwater ecosystems.

""Studies in Lake Kariba over the years have shown how increased water temperatures [lead to] a reduction in fish catches,"" he says.

As water temperatures increase, the solubility of oxygen in the water decreases, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen levels in water bodies like the Zambezi River and Lake Kariba. ""Less dissolved oxygen will affect fish production,"" says Chamisa. ""High temperatures also promote harmful algal blooms that compete with fish for oxygen and also release harmful chemicals that affect fish growth,"" he explains.

Zimparks spokesperson, Tinashe Farawo, told CNN that while investigations to determine the causes of low fish catches were still ongoing, it is apparent that climate change is a contributing factor -- as is overfishing.

""We have recorded a decrease in the number of catches. We have had years of droughts. Water levels have been going down. This has resulted in low catches,"" says Farawo. ""But we also cannot rule out overfishing. We have a full moon calendar [where fishing is prohibited for the last 7 to 10 days of every month to help fish stocks replenish] but in most cases, fishermen defy this. They also encroach on breeding areas.""

Shallow parts of the Zambezi River have now been declared as protected kapenta breeding ground by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks), a state agency responsible for wildlife conservation in the country, meaning it is no longer legal to fish in these areas.

Farawo adds that Zimparks has also stopped issuing fishing permits as an overfishing control measure. ""Lake Kariba is supposed to have 500 fishing rigs. But we have almost doubled that maximum number,"" he says.

A further concern is poaching. ""We once had an encounter with these poachers,"" says Mundimba. ""They robbed our team of about $600 they had after selling kapenta. We reported the matter to the police but we never recovered that money,"" she recalls.

All these factors have driven up the cost of running a fishing business and the cooperative is struggling to pay its fees, particularly the Z$360,000 ($995) annual license fee to Zimparks needed to operate their rig on the River.

""The license fee is beyond our reach considering the low quantity of kapenta we are catching these days,"" says Mundimba.

At the time of publishing, the women had used the co-op's savings and some money from home to fix their rig, but a less profitable business has meant less support on the home front: some of the women's husbands feel that fishing is now draining money from the home instead of boosting them.

When asked what she thinks will improve the circumstances for her and her crew, Mundimba says she's looking to other fishermen to play fair and to the government, water management authorities and multi-national organizations to speed up their efforts to tackle climate change.

""I am hoping that responsible authorities address this climate change issue. It affects us women the most. I also plead with our male counterparts to adhere to fishing regulations,"" she says.

""I will keep on steering the cooperative, praying the kapenta fishing business will become lucrative once more.""

333,This wildlife photographer doesn't just shoot landscapes -- she's changing them at the same time,"(CNN) — Emma Gatland grabbed her fish-eye lens and pointed it up towards the sky.

In her frame was a rhino, tied up by its snout and four feet, being airlifted by a helicopter -- while suspended upside down.

It was a peculiar sight, but for Gatland, the photo she captured in that moment demonstrated a connection between nature and humans. It's something the 39-year-old wildlife photographer strives for with every click of the shutter.

""You want to get into a low angle, get the feeling of what is happening -- the creature being unharmed, but given the opportunity to live a little bit longer -- and documenting what conservation (is),"" Gatland says.

The rhino she photographed was undergoing relocation due to security reasons from the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. For these endangered animals, airlifts are the best option for their health , as being upside down opens their airways.

Born in Zimbabwe, Gatland grew up in South Africa and developed her love for nature after years of family holidays in diverse outdoor environments. ""These became my ultimate happy places,"" Gatland says, adding she was drawn to ""the rawness, the beauty, the vastness (and) the quietness.""

She purchased her first camera for a trip to Morocco and says she quickly fell in love with the combination of ""the technical and artistic.""

The first time she held that camera, ""it just felt right,"" Gatland recalls. ""I remember this ecstatic feeling. Every time I pick up the camera, I still feel the same way.""

Pushing the boundaries

As Gatland's camera equipment became more advanced, so did her creativity, attention to detail and technical knowledge.

""The ultimate privilege in life for me is of capturing a moment in time that is gone in a click, never to happen again,"" Gatland says, ""yet (giving it) a timeless acknowledgment and honoring that it was there.""

Related content Wildlife photography 'hides' teach the virtue of patience

Patience is the key, particularly as a wildlife photographer waiting for something ""epic,"" she adds. Creating a composition that puts perspective on the subject while capturing it in a creative sense is the trickiest part, taking into account unpredictable factors such as lighting, weather and the animals themselves.

""It's engaging in the place you're located in ... and documenting it in its rawest form that excites me, but it's also a challenge at the same time,"" Gatland says.

Inspired by photographers who bend the rules of conventional photography, Gatland has developed her own artistic sense by utilizing different techniques and playing with light and color.

In South Africa, where an abundance of wildlife provides picture-perfect opportunities, a wave of young photographers is emerging -- capturing awe-inspiring moments that carry an important message.

She points to Chad Cocking , a local wildlife photographer based in Timbavati, in northeastern South Africa, as an example of someone who brings in all the proper camera gear and selects the appropriate settings, ""and then put(s) his little creative spin on it,"" she adds.

Her dream photograph is to capture something in epic lowlight, like ""a lion breathing out in the morning mist of a coolish air in Kruger National Park with the sun rising behind it, or a leopard up in a marula tree with the moon setting behind it,"" she says.

Elephants like this one are some of Gatland's favorite animals to photograph. Emma Gatland

A bigger purpose

Gatland says she wants her photos to tell a story and hopes that they draw attention to some of the urgent issues that these animals face -- particularly rhinos, which are under threat from poachers seeking their horns.

The white rhinoceros, which frequently appears in Gatland's images, is classified as near threatened -- with just 18,000 of the species left in the wild.

Gatland is also an example of the growing number of women in Southern Africa's nature photography field.

There weren't many female photographers in the business when she began her journey, Gatland says, but she finds that the the ones who are present ""bring a softer side to the subject.""

She hopes her photography will achieve international recognition and inspire other female photographers, whether young or old, to share the way they see the world.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/emma-gatland-photographer-scn-south-africa-wildlife-spc-intl/index.html
334,African cinema is more exciting than ever. Where's its wider recognition?,"(CNN) Two years ago, ""Parasite"" director Bong Joon Ho called out American audiences. His charge? Americans don't know enough about movies outside their own borders.

""Once you overcome the 1-inch tall barrier of subtitles,"" he said, while accepting a Golden Globe award for his film, ""you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.""

Now, Americans are seemingly consuming more international art than ever before. After winning at the Golden Globes, ""Parasite"" went on to win the biggest award in Hollywood: best picture at the Academy Awards . Some of Netflix's most-watched shows, like ""Lupin"" or ""Squid Game"" are from outside the US, dubbed or subtitled in English. And some of this year's most lauded films were international offerings -- Norway's ""The Worst Person in the World"" and Japan's ""Drive My Car.""

Yet one continent has seemingly found itself outside the buzz: Africa. The continent has been producing more movies than ever, with 12 countries submitting films to the Oscars in 2021 -- a record. Meanwhile, Nigeria's commercial film industry, ""Nollywood,"" only just began to emerge in the 1990s -- and is now considered almost as large as Hollywood

But even as these movies are recognized abroad, recognition in the US has been slower to come. ""Lingui, The Sacred Bonds,"" for example, was Chad's entry to this year's Academy Awards for best international feature and screened at festivals all over the world, including at France's prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Still, for those in the US, the film was difficult to find until the distribution rights were finally purchased by MUBI, thus making it available to stream.

""Just like (cinema) is a big orchestra...I just want a place for everyone to play their own music in the big orchestra,"" Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, the director of ""Lingui,"" told CNN. ""(African filmmakers) should be in the melody of the world.""

Hollywood puts Africa in a box

The issue, in part, is one of perceptions. Many Hollywood executives thought, and continue to think, that no one is interested in seeing films focused on Black and African people, said Moradewun Adejunmobi, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies African literature and pop culture.

She used the success of 2018's ""Black Panther"" as an example. The film, part of a popular American superhero franchise, was expected to do well. But to make $1 billion worldwide in one month? Hollywood executives were taken aback, Adejunmobi said.

""It's that lack of imagination, that lack of understanding, that a film looking at a Black-centered world could do well,"" Adejunmobi said.

""Nafi's Father,"" a 2019 film directed by Mamadou Dia, explores how a small town in Senegal drifts toward extreism.

That same lack of imagination is also at play when it comes to movies from the continent. She pointed to the Academy Awards as an example.

In 2021, 12 countries in Africa submitted movies to the Oscars' best international feature film category -- the most African countries to ever submit. Ivory Coast's ""Night of the Kings"" made the shortlist, while Tunisia's ""The Man Who Sold His Skin"" received an official nomination, which goes to just five non-US movies per year. This year, 10 countries submitted to the awards. None advanced.

In the entire history of the Academy Awards, only three movies from African countries have ever won the best international feature film award. All three movies were directed by White men.

""It's kind of a shame,"" Haroun said. ""A whole continent is just forgotten. I don't understand.""

Just the way the award is set up makes it difficult for movies from Africa to compete, said Mamadou Dia, director of ""Nafi's Father,"" Senegal's entry for the 2021 awards.

Everything -- from hiring a publicist, to navigate the ins and outs of Academy voting, to advertising the movie -- adds up, he explained. The Oscar run for ""Nafi's Father"" cost Dia tens of thousands for the first phase alone, a cost he hadn't expected.

Films submitted to the Oscars also require a commercial release -- something not every filmmaker in Africa can afford, especially considering some countries don't actually have that many theaters.

Dia rented a van, bought a projector and screen, and drove the movie around the country to play. In Matam, his hometown and where the movie was shot, some people had never seen a screen so big.

Spending all that money on an Oscars run is hard to justify, though, especially when that money could instead go toward financing another film.

But the Oscars are a path into the US market. The awards were a chance to show everyone that a movie from Senegal -- with no co-productions in Europe, shot in Dia's small hometown of Matam and completely in Fulah, the local language -- could make it all the way to Dolby Theatre. To Dia, that was worth a shot.

""All the major festivals of the world, most of the time, they pick one movie from Africa and they say 'That's it, we have enough,'"" Dia said. ""That's bullsh*t. Africa is 54 different states and countries and more than 2,000 different languages. You cannot just put us into a box.""

Jude Akuwudike in ""Eyimofe,"" a Nigerian movie following the journey of two people trying to leave the country.

Yet that's what much of US entertainment has done. Depictions of Africa on TV are broadly negative, a 2018 study from the University of Southern California found, with viewers twice as likely to see negative depictions of the continent than positive ones. That is, of course, if the continent was ever mentioned.

On the film festival level though, Haroun noted that movies from Africa do receive recognition. Chuko Esiri, who co-directed ""Eyimofe"" with brother Arie, told CNN he didn't think there was a discernible difference in how their movie was received in the United States, having won awards at festivals in San Francisco, Seattle and Philadelphia, as well as the NAACP Image Awards.

Streaming changes everything

During the 1980s and 1990s, it was borderline impossible to find African movies. Film industries in African countries were much smaller than Hollywood, with far fewer films being made, and the technology wasn't the same back then, Adejunmobi said.

There were no DVDs or streaming services where movies from around the world were easily available to anyone.

California Newsreel, a small nonprofit film distribution company, did regularly distribute movies from Senegal, Adejunmobi said. But those outside of academic circles may not have known about the nonprofit and, simply put, the interest wasn't there.

These days, with DVDs and YouTube, it's easier and cheaper to both make and distribute movies.

""Almost everywhere, it is possible for people to pick up some basic kind of camera, could be an iPhone, and begin to produce and shoot something,"" Adejunmobi said. ""It's easier to produce, easier to shoot and easier to circulate.""

Streaming's business model makes that circulation easier. Mainstream Hollywood's business model relies on tentpole movies that cater to a wide variety of people (think Marvel) -- which makes it difficult for films from Africa to be received in the US, Adejunmobi said.

But streaming services require a large, wide-ranging collection that can cater to many different groups. There, film and television from Africa can thrive.

It's already happening. Netflix just began production on the third season of ""Blood & Water,"" a South African teen crime show, and distributed a rerelease of Ethiopian director Haile Gerima's landmark film ""Sankofa"" late last year. Hulu has Ivory Coast's ""Night of the Kings."" Kenya's ""Rafiki,"" a gay love story, is on Showtime.

Smaller services are getting in on the action, too -- Criterion Collection will feature Nigeria 's ""Eyimofe,"" its first film from the country, and also has two films by Senegalese auteur Ousmane Sembène. In addition to ""Lingui,"" MUBI is also streaming a collection of Haroun's earlier films.

Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, who most recently directed ""Lingui, the Sacred Bonds.""

Though it can still be difficult to find movies from the continent, even lauded ones, Adejunmobi said the landscape is much better now than in previous decades. Films from Africa can circulate, she said -- just maybe not through the big screen at your favorite neighborhood theater.

Still, visibility has its traps. Adejunmobi used ""Tsotsi"" as an example -- the 2005 South African film was the most recent from the continent to win the Academy Award for best foreign language film (as the international category was previously called). The movie, which takes place in the aftermath of apartheid, follows the story of a young gangster who steals a car, only to find a baby inside. It's a ""feel-good movie about race,"" Adejunmobi said, and it ends with a moment of redemption.

But there were other movies made at the same time that asked harder questions about South African society and the world. The fact that ""Tsotsi"" became the first film from the continent to win the award in almost 30 years shows that maybe recognition from the US is only given to stories that neatly fit what American audiences want to see.

""I'm kind of ambivalent about when certain African films break out and are given entry in the American cinema space,"" Adejunmobi said. ""Because I feel that they tend to be telling stories that are catering to what maybe certain segments of the American audience want to hear, but they are not necessarily films that are engaging at a harder level, at a more substantive level, with the questions that people in whatever the country it is might be asking.""

On the whole, though, there has been a positive shift, Esiri said.

""I do care very much about American audiences seeing (""Eyimofe""),"" he said. ""We make stories to share our culture and people with the world. Film is the easiest way to gain an understanding of the other peoples we share this planet with. More often than not what you discover is that we are, at base, the same.""

Whether Hollywood pays attention, cinema in Africa is growing. IROKOtv, a streaming service for Nigerian movies, has become one of the largest on-demand services for Nigerian movies, despite its beginnings as a YouTube channel. Now, the distributor has become so renowned that Canal+ -- one of the biggest media companies in Europe -- bought its production studio in 2019.

Smaller steps are being taken, too. One of the biggest barriers facing many movies coming out of African countries is the weakness of the film market. In countries like Chad or Cameroon, movie theaters are basically nonexistent, Haroun said. Still, his film played in 10 countries the same day, something that he said is very new. If movies from the continent can do well at home first, that could help increase their visibility.

""If you have a film, an African film, which got 1 million people in Africa, (made) $1 million at the box office, I'm sure that everyone will be interested because maybe it will work in another country,"" he said. ""So we have to first build an economy and a real market in Africa, and that will open more doors I think.""

Arie and Chuko Esiri on the set of ""Eyimofe.""

There are still challenges domestically, though, particularly for indie or art house movies, Esiri said. Even in a country like Nigeria, home to a huge commercial film industry, promoting ""Eyimofe"" was difficult.

""The domestic market is saturated with explicitly commercial fare, art house or indie film was an entirely new proposition,"" Esiri said. ""The mechanisms for marketing were not particularly effective and it will be something we shall have to continue to work on.""

And still, too often, movies from the continent are linked to a single auteur rather than a broader industry, Dia said. But now, a whole generation of African filmmakers is emerging, he said, telling stories in ways that feel true using their own traditions, cultures and folktales.

That new generation, Haroun said, is tackling social and political issues in fresh ways. He pointed to Mati Diop's ""Atlantique"" as one example, and Dia's work in ""Nafi's Father"" as another. Which is to say: scarcity is not the issue. The art is there.

A cinephile culture on the continent is developing, too. The Panafrican Film Festival, commonly known as FESPACO, the Africa Movie Academy Awards, and film festivals in Durban, South Africa, Zanzibar and Egypt all award films from the continent. This, Adejunmobi said, is where the recognition is really coming from.

In spite of everything, film in Africa continues to grow. And the work is exquisite -- just see the rich choreography in ""Night of the Kings,"" the soft light of ""Lingui,"" the tension of ""Nafi's Father,"" the challenges in ""Eyimofe"" deliciously depicted in 16mm film. These all just in the last few years.

335,Ukraine war: Why some African countries are thinking twice about calling out Putin,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nelson Mandela was once asked why he still had relationships with, among others, Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat, the Cuban and Palestinian leaders who had been branded terrorists by Western powers. The revered South African statesman replied that it was a mistake ""to think that their enemies should be our enemies.""

This stance has largely typified some African nations' response to the Russia-Ukraine war. Across the continent, many appear hesitant to risk their own security, foreign investment and trade by backing one side in this conflict.

While there has been widespread condemnation of the attacks on Ukrainian civilians and their own citizens fleeing the warzone -- from countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya -- there has been a much more muted response from some key African nations.

Countries on the continent find themselves in a delicate position and will not want to get drawn into proxy battles, says Remi Adekoya, associate lecturer at England's University of York.

""There's a strong strand of thought in African diplomacy that says African states should maintain the principle of non-interference and so they shouldn't get caught up in proxy wars between the East and the West. As some states did get caught up in proxy wars during the Cold War, for instance,"" Adekoya told CNN.

One influential voice that has made it clear he will not make an enemy out of Russian leader Vladimir Putin is South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

While addressing his country's parliament Thursday, he said: ""Our position is very clear ... there are those who are insisting that we should take a very adversarial stance and position against, say Russia. And the approach that we have chosen to take ... is we are insisting that there should be dialogue.""

After initially releasing a statement calling for Russia to immediately pull its forces out of Ukraine, South Africa has since laid the blame for the war directly at NATO's doorstep for considering Ukraine's membership into the military alliance, which Russia is against.

""The war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less instability in the region."" Ramaphosa said in parliament Thursday.

Former South African President Jacob Zuma also earlier issued a statement saying Russia ""felt provoked.""

""Putin has been very patient with the western forces. He has been crystal clear about his opposition of the eastern expansion of ... NATO into Ukraine ... and is on the record about the military threat posed to Russia by the presence of the forces ... it looks justifiable that Russia felt provoked,"" Zuma said in a statement issued by his foundation on March 6.

South Africa has strong ties to Russia and Ramaphosa has written about being approached to be a mediator in the conflict given its membership of BRICS -- a group of emerging economies comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

The ties between the two countries also date back to apartheid times when the former Soviet Union supported South Africa and the African National Congress party in their liberation struggles. ""Those favors have not been forgotten,"" said Adekoya.

South Africa was one of 17 African nations to abstain on the UN resolution demanding that Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine on March 2. It took a similar stance during Putin's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Nigeria and Egypt were among the 28 African nations that voted to condemn Russia, while eight others didn't submit a vote. Eritrea was the only African country that outrightly voted against the resolution.

Zimbabwe's foreign ministry said in a statement it was unconvinced that the UN resolution was driven towards dialogue, rather ""it poured more fuel to the fire, thus complicating the situation.""

'Strongman leadership'

Many of the countries that abstained from the UN vote are authoritarian regimes. They see Putin's unilateral decision to invade Ukraine as a show of power and ego that they can appreciate and align with, Yetunde Odugbesan-Omede, a political analyst and professor at New York's Farmingdale State College, told CNN.

One of those who have spoken out prominently in support of the Russian leader is Lt. Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the influential son of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

His father has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for 36 years and there has been speculation that Kainerugaba is a would-be successor when the 78-year-old Museveni eventually stands down.

Kainerugaba tweeted that: ""The majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russia's stand in Ukraine. Putin is absolutely right!""

Some African countries have also hesitated in speaking out against Russia because they want to ""keep their options open if they face existential threats or some kind of revolution in their own country in the future,"" said Adekoya.

""They saw Putin keep Assad in power in Syria because if not for Russia's intervention, Assad's regime would have fallen long ago,"" he added.

Adekoya also pointed out that some of the muted response stems from what is perceived as Western hypocrisy.

Kenya's UN Security Council representative Martin Kimani gave a powerful speech on the brink of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Kimani drew a parallel between Ukraine's emergence as an independent state after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the experience of post-colonial states in Africa, criticizing Russian PresidentVladimir Putin's buildup of forces and his support for redrawing Ukraine's borders by recognizing the breakaway statelets of Donetsk and Luhansk.

""Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force,"" he said, referring to Russia's recognition of the two territories as independent states. ""We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.""

During the speech, he also mentioned other nations on the Security Council who had breached international law and faced no sanctions. ""He didn't mention them by name, but he was talking about the US and UK who invaded Iraq in 2003 ... and were never really held to account,"" Adekoya said.

""There are many people in many parts of the world who would like to see other regions gaining strength and would like to see the end of Western domination of the world order, putting it simply ... of course, no right-thinking person in Africa or anywhere in the world looks at what is going on in Ukraine now and thinks that it's a good thing ... but many people do see the hypocrisy,"" he added.

Establishing stronger ties

In recent years, Russia has established itself as one of Africa's most valuable trading partners -- becoming a major supplier of military hardware with key alliances in Nigeria, Libya, Ethiopia and Mali.

Africa accounted for 18% of Russian arms exports between 2016 and 2020, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) think tank.

Some analysts say the support or non-censure of Russia speaks to a wider sentiment in parts of Africa that Western policy positions do not always work in their favor.

""The message that Moscow is pushing is that if you are tired of the paternalistic way the West approaches you, we are going to be your security partners. It will be a relationship of equals,"" Aanu Adeoye, a Russia-Africa analyst at Chatham House, told CNN.



Unlike many of its European counterparts, Russia is not a former colonial power in Africa and so has a wider scope of opportunity in making soft power moves that aim to challenge Western dominance on the continent.

The Soviet Union also had client relationships with many African states during the Cold War, and Moscow has looked to revive some of those ties.

Before the invasion, Russian state media outlet RT announced plans to set up a new hub in Kenya with a job ad that said it wanted to ""cover stories that have been overlooked by other organizations"" and that ""challenge conventional wisdom about Africa.

Yet Africa has often been at the heart of the tussle for influence in the great power competitions between key geopolitical players such as the US, China and Russia.

Some countries are trying to leverage this position in a variety of ways.

Odugbesan-Omede explained that Tanzania, for example, has identified the current situation as a chance for its energy industry to profit. ""Tanzania's President, Samia Suluhu Hassan, sees this an opportunity to look for markets to export gas,"" she said. ""Tanzania has the sixth largest gas reserve in Africa. While some African countries will sustain some economic shock from the Russian-Ukraine fight, others are trying to weather the storm by looking for new avenues of profitability,"" Odugbesan-Omede added.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/africa/africa-leaders-ukraine-response-cmd-intl/index.html
336,They moved to Ukraine for an education. Now they're living in a city occupied by Russian forces,"(CNN) African students trapped in southern Ukraine's Kherson are crying out for help, as Russian forces try to consolidate their occupation of the port city .

The students told CNN they are spending most of their time in underground bunkers in freezing temperatures as Russian soldiers prevent anyone from entering or leaving Kherson.

Many of the students are terrified of the repercussions of speaking out in the media and have asked CNN to withhold their full names for fear of their safety.

""We are living a nightmare. We don't live, we are surviving,"" Christophe, a first-year student from Cameroon living in Kherson, told CNN. ""The only hope ... right now is when sleeping, if you can sleep. It's hoping that tomorrow someone will tell you that you will get evacuated.""

He added: ""We are students. We came here to study. We didn't come for this. And now, you see most of your friends that were living in other cities have left. They are not in this situation. You can imagine our families calling us every day like, 'Please, tell me there is something new.' What am I going to tell them?""

The 23-year-old said that Cameroonian embassy in Ukraine had not responded to him, although he had reached out. After trying others in Europe, the only embassy that answered his call for help was the one in Germany.

""They said we have heard about you. We are working on it and that is all."" He says he hasn't heard from the embassy since.

""We are not asking for anything special. We are asking for help,"" he said.

The embassy of Cameroon in Germany told CNN in an email statement that they are working to get the students out of Kherson ""but it is very difficult for the moment.""

Christophe and some of his fellow students have also been making public appeals for help in videos on Twitter.

Routes out of Kherson are fraught with danger and difficulty. Nigerian national Akinyemi studied in Ukraine. He now lives in Tyahynka, a small village less than an hour outside of Kherson, and works as a sailor.

He recalls those who tried to flee the city turning back at the sight of Russian military equipment.

Despite the risk, some students have attempted to flee -- without much success.

""We formed a group and we noticed that virtually everybody is still here. So far, only one guy that I know of has managed to leave. No other students have left. Almost 100% is still here,"" Akinyemi told CNN.

The recent graduate has lived in Ukraine since 2016 and describes a terrifying life in the shadow of a fierce Russian military presence. ""[Russia] moves their military equipment virtually every day. There are a lot of checkpoints manned by soldiers,"" he said.

""The Russian military in the village here told us that you can tie something white to your left hand and go to wherever you want to go but just go with your passport,"" he said.

""The stores are dry. We've bought everything already ... and [are] using firewood to cook,"" Akinyemi said.

""The experience is traumatic. Even at the sound of the door, I think it's the sound of gunshot or something,"" he said. ""[In the bunker], there is no internet so there is no way to stay in connection with our families back home so that they won't be worried.""

Akinyemi believes that the solution for students stuck in and around Kherson is simple: ""We need all possible means of creating a green corridor for the Kherson region like they did with Sumy."" Between March 8 and 10, all civilians in the northeastern city of Sumy were able to leave via evacuation corridors.

Students like Akinyemi and Christophe want Ukrainian and African government officials to make similar negotiations for the safe exit of all civilians in Kherson.

Nigeria has so far evacuated more than 1,500 students from Ukraine, according to the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission , a federal government agency.

Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said in a tweet on March 13 that he was in contact with his country's ambassadors in Ukraine and Russia as they ""engage the Russian and Indian Governments, as well as NGOs, in a bid to safely evacuate about 80 Nigerian maritime students in Kherson, Southern Ukraine."" India has a large number of students in Ukraine as well and has been evacuating its own nationals.

Onyeama also wrote that he spoke on the phone with a Nigerian student leader in Kherson ""to reassure him of positive developments.""

Desperate for a way out

Hyacinthe, a master's student from the Ivory Coast, says he was playing basketball in the street when he first saw Russian military entering Kherson on February 24.

""We heard people starting to run and we heard shooting,"" he told CNN in a phone call.

Hyacinthe made desperate efforts to leave the city only to find that there were no trains, buses or taxis as the city was surrounded.

Taxis that would brave the journey were demanding up to 500 euros per person, he said. A steep price for students.

""We called some taxis and they said that they can come and pick us [up] but it was very expensive. Each of us would pay 500 euro per person. We don't have that money. Until today, we are just calling trying to find a way to leave Kherson.""

Hyacinthe told CNN that just a day before, some Egyptian and Lebanese students paid the sum each to take a taxi out of Kherson via Crimea, with hopes of crossing into Russia.

Their progress is unknown. Some students have even tried exiting the city on foot.

""When they arrived at the border of Kherson, they met the Russian army. They told them that without a special agreement, we cannot allow you to leave the city,"" he said.

The 29-year-old said that he knows of around 60 other foreign students still in Kherson, originating from countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Libya, Algeria and Tunisia.

He has lived in Ukraine for four years and says that the country is a popular choice for students because of the affordable university fees.

Under Russian occupation, Kherson residents report seeing armed Russian men going door to door, checking passports, and asking for guests' phone numbers amid growing protests.

Hyacinthe describes the resilience he has seen from Ukrainians in Kherson: ""If they meet Russian troops they start to shout and protest 'this is Ukraine!'"" he said.

On Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets waving Ukrainian flags and chanting anti-Russian slogans.

'They are always shooting'

The sounds of helicopters and shooting have become common in Kherson. ""Outside is like a no-man's land. It's very quiet and everybody is afraid. You have to move very quickly as we don't know when [fighting] will start,"" Hyacinthe said. ""They're always shooting, every day, every night -- especially in the night. Two days ago, we were without electricity and internet and network,"" he added.

""Right now, we need a diplomatic vehicle to come and pick us up without any risk. We are afraid because they say it's not safe,"" Hyacinthe said.

For these foreign students in Kherson, they say they support each other by sharing everything that they have. ""We always share our things, that is the African mentality. If someone has something like bread or eggs or oil, let's have some omelets and eat together,"" Hyacinthe said.

""We are brothers, no matter where you are from or which country you are from. That's how we survive here.""

337,"Higher food prices, slumping trade: How the war in Ukraine could hit Africa","Abuja, Nigeria (CNN Business) As Russian troops tear through Ukraine , swathes of Africa are gearing up to bear the brunt of a potentially drawn-out conflict between the ex-Soviet republics — two of some of the continent's most cherished trading partners.

African economists sound the alarm over a looming and likely catastrophic lowering of trade volumes between the continent and its warring partners if Russia's widely condemned incursion into Ukraine isn't short-lived.

Russia and Ukraine are key players in the global agricultural trade, with both nations accounting for a quarter of the world's wheat exports, including at least 14 percent of corn exports in 2020, and a joint 58 percent of global sunflower oil exports in the same year, analysis show

Trade between African countries and the former Soviet neighbors, especially Russia, has flourished in recent years with Russian exports to the continent valued at $14 billion annually, and imports from Africa pegged at around $5 billion per year.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) gestures as Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (L) and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (R) pose for a family photo with African countries leaders attending 2019 Russia-Africa Summit and Economic Forum in Sochi on October 24, 2019.

But these gains are on the verge of eroding quickly, analysts worry, signaling a severe disruption in Africa's food conditions if Russia's military operation in Ukraine persists.

'Three months away from hunger'

Parts of Africa could be plunged into hunger in as fast as three months if Russia's invasion of Ukraine lingers, says Wandile Sihlobo, the Chief Economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa.

""In the short term, between now and three months, the conflict will affect food supply primarily from a pricing perspective,"" Sihlobo told CNN.

""As net importers of products like wheat, which influences bread and cereals, sunflower oil and maize, African countries are fairly exposed on some of these supplies that are coming out of Russia and Ukraine. There will be challenges if the war continues for more than three months — because ordinarily, countries usually keep stock of supplies for three to five months.""

Sihlobo explains that the Ukraine war also comes at a bad time for Africa given the current experience of a severe drought in its eastern subregion , which has taken a hit on food prices.

""Food prices are already high now. If the war stretches, there will be millions of Africans that will be in hunger. We are already expecting millions of people to be in hunger in the areas affected by the drought, so the ongoing conflict will worsen that,"" he said.

Africa's biggest economies such as Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Algeria, and Kenya are major importers of Russia's agricultural exports, putting them at risk of further spikes in food prices if trade is disrupted.

Sihlobo adds that sanctions targeted at Russia could also complicate Africa's exports.

""Africa exports fruits and vegetables to Russia and Ukraine. Seven percent of South Arica's citrus goes to Russia, 14 percent of South Africa's apples and pears goes to Russia. Egypt and Tunisia also export fruits and vegetables to Russia. The challenge with all of these countries is that with all of the sanctions that are placed on Russia by the US and European countries, it influences the financial services sector... even if the logistics will not be immediately affected, it will disrupt the payment system to all of the exporting countries to Russia,"" he told CNN.

Development economist Ndumiso Hadebe agrees that ""Africa is likely to see disturbances in the supply chains that pertain to goods and services that are exported and imported between Russia and Africa"" as Russia is slammed with a barrage of sanctions by critics of its Ukraine invasion.

Taking sides on the conflict

Hadebe tells CNN that Africa's largely muted response towards the Russia - Ukraine conflict may cave in for a more direct stance on parties involved in the war if fighting intensifies.

Only a handful of governments on the continent have spoken out in the aftermath of the attacks, with the African Union urging Russia's respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""There will be significant pressure from a multilateral relations point of view as African countries may be forced to take a position on the conflict that is happening between Russia and Ukraine, and that may either adversely or positively affect the relationship between Africa and Russia going forward,"" Hadebe says.

For Russian academic, Irina Filatova, taking sides won't benefit Africa.

""It won't be in Africa's benefit to take sides. I think that Africa can try to remain neutral,"" said Filatova, who specializes in Russian and African history.

Beyond agriculture, Russia is expanding its influence in African states troubled with insurgency by providing alternative military solutions from those offered by its Western counterparts, which are often determined by human rights considerations.

Russian mercenaries have continually come under allegations of human rights infractions in the Central African Republic and other parts of Africa where they were contracted by regional governments to combat local rebels.

However, Russia has denied links to private military contractors such as the Wagner Group, which is accused of the abuses.

Hadebe told CNN that arms trade is ""one of the key features that have defined the trade relationship between Russia and Africa.""

""Russia is the largest exporter of weapons to sub-Saharan Africa in particular.""

Africa accounted for 18 percent of Russian arms exports between 2016 and 2020, according to data by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

According to Filatova, Russia's prospects of doubling down on its interests in Africa may be higher in the aftermath of the Ukraine war.

""Russia will be much more interested in maintaining relations with African countries than it was until now... It has already started to develop these relations but in the situation of the global isolation by the western world, it will definitely try to maintain relations with Africa,"" she told CNN.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/05/business/ukraine-war-hits-africa-lgs-cmd-intl/index.html
338,"'Help us, we're stranded': International students say they're trapped in northeast Ukraine","(CNN) Hundreds of international students trapped in the Ukrainian city of Sumy by Russia's invasion have appealed to the world: ""Help us, we are stranded.""

Vivian Udenze, 21, a Nigerian medical student at Sumy State University told CNN: ""This is the 8th day since the crisis began. A lot of places have been evacuated. There are more than 600 of us who are foreigners and students.""

She said most of the group are medical students, and they are from Nigeria, Morocco, Tanzania, Congo and India, among other countries.

Sumy lies in the northeast of Ukraine, only around 30 miles from the border with Russia.

As fierce battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces rage across the country, Udenze told CNN via phone that she woke up to two loud explosions around 8 a.m. on Wednesday, and heard gunshots on Thursday. ""I am so scared and time is running out. ""We don't want the Russians to enter the city and meet us here. We need a humanitarian corridor so we can get out,"" she said.

339,"Foreign students fleeing Ukraine say they face segregation, racism at border","(CNN) As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, foreign students attempting to leave the country say they are experiencing racist treatment by Ukrainian security forces and border officials.

One African medical student told CNN that she and other foreigners were ordered off the public transit bus at a checkpoint between Ukraine and Poland border.

They were told to stand aside as the bus drove off with only Ukrainian nationals on board, she says.

Rachel Onyegbule, a Nigerian first-year medical student in Lviv was left stranded at the border town of Shehyni, some 400 miles from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

She told CNN: ""More than 10 buses came and we were watching everyone leave. We thought after they took all the Ukrainians they would take us, but they told us we had to walk, that there were no more buses and told us to walk.""

""My body was numb from the cold and we haven't slept in about 4 days now. Ukrainians have been prioritized over Africans -- men and women -- at every point. There's no need for us to ask why. We know why. I just want to get home,"" Onyegbule told CNN in a telephone call Sunday as she waited in line at the border to cross into Poland.

Onyegbule says she eventually got her exit document stamped on Monday morning around 4.30 a.m. local time.

University students, including many from Nigeria, fleeing from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, stow their luggage as they get on their transport bus near the Hungarian-Ukrainian border in the village of Tarpa in Hungary on February 28, 2022.

Allegations of violence

Saakshi Ijantkar, a fourth-year medical student from India, also shared her ordeal with CNN Monday via a phone call from Lviv, western Ukraine.

""There are three checkposts we need to go through to get to the border. A lot of people are stranded there. They don't allow Indians to go through.

CNN has been unable to confirm the identities or affiliations of the people who operated the checkpoints, but Ijantkar said they were all wearing uniforms.

T

hey allow 30 Indians only after 500 Ukrainians get in. To get to this border you need to walk 4 to 5 kilometers from the first checkpoint to the second one. Ukrainians are given taxis and buses to travel, all other nationalities have to walk. They were very racist to Indians and other nationalities,'"" the 22-year-old from Mumbai told CNN.

She added that she witnessed violence from the guards to the students waiting at the Ukrainian side of the Shehyni-Medyka border.

Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 are no longer allowed to leave the country, but that decree does not extend to men who are foreign nationals.

Ijantkar says she saw Indian men were left in queues for long hours along with other non-Ukrainian nationalities.

""They were very cruel. The second checkpoint was the worst. When they opened the gate for you to cross to the Ukrainian border, you stay between the Ukraine and Poland, the Ukrainian army don't allow Indian men and boys to cross when you get there. They only allowed the Indian girls to get in. We had to literally cry and beg at their feet. After the Indian girls got in, the boys were beaten up. There was no reason for them to beat us with this cruelty,"" Ijantkar said.

""I saw an Egyptian man standing at the front with his hands on the rails, and because of that one guard pushed him with so much force and the man hit the fence, which is covered in spikes, and he lost consciousness,"" she said.

""We took him outside to give him CPR. They just didn't care and they were beating the students, they didn't give two hoots about us, only the Ukrainians,"" she added.

CNN contacted the Ukrainian army in light of the allegations of violence, but did not immediately hear back.

Freezing conditions

Ijantkar said many of the students waited for at least a day, but she eventually turned back to Lviv because she was terrified, waiting in freezing temperatures with no food, water, or blankets.

""I saw people shaking so terribly in the cold, they were collapsing because of hypothermia. Some have frostbite and blisters. We couldn't get any help and (were) just standing for hours,"" she said.

Andriy Demchenko, a spokesman for the Border Guard Service of Ukraine told CNN Monday that allegations of segregation at the borders are untrue and that the guards are working under enormous pressure at the borders -- but are working within the law.

""From the day when (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has made an attack on Ukraine, the influx of people trying to leave Ukraine and the war zone has increased tremendously. If earlier, people trying to cross the border into the European Union and back amounted up to 50,000 (people) a day, now the amount doubled and continues to increase. There is huge pressure on checkpoints, on border guards.

""In order to speed up the process and allow larger amounts of people to cross, the government has simplified the procedure of the border crossing as much as possible. Due to the increase in the volume of the individuals crossing, people have to stay in long queues. However, I can state that everything happens according to the law. There is absolutely no division by nation, citizenship, or class at the border,"" Demchenko said.

Ukraine attracts many foreign students wanting to study medicine because it has a strong reputation for medical courses and tuition -- and other expenses are much lower than in programs in other Western nations.

Another stranded student told CNN on Sunday that border staff on the Ukrainian side of the border were showing prejudice against foreign students.

""They are depriving the foreigners. They are being very racist with us at the border. They tell us that Ukrainian citizens have to pass first while telling foreigners to stay back,"" said Nneka Abigail, a 23-year-old medical student from Nigeria.

""It's very difficult at the moment for Nigerians and other foreigners to cross. The Ukrainian officials are allowing more Ukrainians to cross into Poland. For instance, around 200 to 300 Ukrainians can cross, and then only 10 foreigners or 5 will be allowed to cross... and the duration of time is too long. It's really hard.. they push us, kick us, insult us,"" Abigail said.

Africans have been sharing their experiences online using the hashtag #AfricansinUkraine. Their stories have prompted an outcry and a number of crowdfunding appeals have been launched to try help those stranded in the country.

People fleeing the violence in Ukraine are seen at the Medyka pedestrian border crossing in eastern Poland on February 27, 2022.

One of those who shared their story online is Korrine Sky, a medical student from Zimbabwe who had been studying in Ukraine since September.

She fled the country on Friday but, with the aid of two London-based friends, managed to raise more than £20,000 ($26,800) to help stranded Afro-Caribbean students.

""This situation we're in is a life-or-death situation. We need to make sure that all the African students cross the border successfully and safely,"" she said, speaking on Instagram Live from the Romanian side of the border on Sunday.

Around 500,000 refugees from Ukraine have so far crossed to neighboring European countries, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Monday.

Are home countries doing enough to help their citizens?

Some of those CNN spoke to said they did not blame the Ukrainian authorities for prioritizing their citizens but rather their own governments for not making arrangements to assist them out of the country.

The ""Nigerian government is being their usual nonchalant self,"" Onyegbule said.

""There are many of us in Ukraine. They can't just leave us like this. It's so sad but we are used to the bad governance in Nigeria. It's very sad.""

Onyegbule acknowledged that there were Nigerian officials waiting to meet her and others once she crossed over into Poland.

""It would have been so helpful in Ukraine, we were looking for someone to speak on our behalf there.""

Nigeria's foreign affairs minister Geoffrey Onyeama said on Twitter that Ukrainian authorities had assured him that there were no restrictions on foreigners wanting to leave Ukraine.

""Problem is the result of chaos on the border and checkpoints leading to them,"" he stated, adding that he is ""personally coordinating with our missions in Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Romania and Hungary to ensure we get our citizens out of Ukraine and bring back to Nigeria those ready to return while supporting those who are remaining in Ukraine.""

CNN has contacted Onyeama for comment on allegations that the Nigerian government hasn't done enough to help its citizens leave Ukraine.

A spokesperson for President Buhari, Garba Shehu, has urged that: ""All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.""

Shehu added that there are some four thousand students in Ukraine from Nigeria mostly studying medicine.

African nations on the UN Security Council Monday condemned discrimination against African citizens at the Ukrainian border during a UNSC meeting at the UN HQ in New York City.

""We strongly condemn this racism and believe that it is damaging to the spirit of solidarity that is so urgently needed today. The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe's borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or to those crossing the Mediterranean,"" Kenyan Ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani said Monday.

Onyegbule, the first-year medical student, said she was attracted to study in Ukraine because she was looking for a ""safe and cheap option outside Nigeria.""

340,African nations condemn reports of racism against students at Ukrainian border,"(CNN) Representatives from the three African nations on the UN Security Council -- Kenya, Ghana, and Gabon -- all condemned reports of discrimination against African citizens at the Ukrainian border during a meeting at the UN HQ in New York City Monday.



There have been widespread reports from African students fleeing the country that they faced segregation, racism and abuse.



""In the unfolding emergency, there have been disturbing reports about the racist treatment of Africans and people of African descent seeking to flee Ukraine to safety. The media is covering these appalling incidents and several states have confirmed that their citizens are suffering such treatment. We strongly condemn this racism and believe that it is damaging to the spirit of solidarity that is so urgently needed today.



""The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe's borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or to those crossing the Mediterranean,"" Kenyan Ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani said Monday.



The African Union has said it is ""disturbed"" by the reports of segregation against Africans in Ukraine, which it described as ""shockingly racist.""

""Reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and in breach international law,"" a statement by the AU said Monday.

The 54 member bloc urged countries to ""show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.""

Kimani added that the Security Council needs ""to be able to understand that there are actors who want to magnify this story for cynical reasons that have nothing to do with the wellbeing and safety of Africans.""

He also thanked Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia for allowing Kenyan citizens fleeing Ukraine visa-free entry into their countries.

Ghanaian Deputy Ambassador to the UN Carolyn Oppong-Ntiri echoed the sentiment in her remarks, calling for the facilitation of persons fleeing Ukraine ""without discrimination"" and to provide them with humanitarian assistance, ""including medical care in line with the principles of humanity, neutrality, and impartiality.""

341,"South Africa has passed its Omicron outbreak peak, top researcher says","(CNN) South Africa has passed the peak of its Omicron outbreak, according to one of the country's top scientific researchers.

The country has ""surpassed the peak of the Omicron wave now, driven by the significant decline in the populous province and epicenter: Gauteng,"" Ridhwaan Suliman, senior researcher at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), told CNN on Wednesday.

This was echoed by one of the country's top scientists, Michelle Groome of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), who told a media briefing earlier Wednesday that all indications show ""that we've surpassed the peak of infections in Gauteng.""

There was a 20.8% decrease in the number of new Covid-19 cases detected in South Africa as of December 18, according to the NICD's epidemiology brief published Wednesday.

Most other provinces in the country have also passed their peaks, Suliman said.

The rule comes into effect on Tuesday at Kotoka International Airport in the capital Accra, Ghana Airports said. It follows a health ministry move last week to require all people entering Ghana to be vaccinated.

The measures are some of the strictest in Africa, where vaccine uptake has been challenged by lack of supply and logistical issues even as the new Omicron variant raises concerns about quicker transmission of the virus.

Ghana's tightening of restrictions comes as the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced a 75 million euro ($85 million) investment loan to support its pandemic response - the largest such support for a COVID-19 program in sub-Saharan Africa.

""Ghana has taken significant steps to manage the impact of COVID and to unlock long-term investment,"" EIB President Werner Hoyer said in a statement.

The authorities launched a massive vaccination drive this month ahead of the enforcement from January 22 of a vaccine mandate for targeted groups, including government employees, health workers and students. It plans to recruit more health workers to be able to double daily inoculation from 140,000.

Ghana, one of West Africa's largest economies that runs on exports of cocoa, gold and oil, has so far vaccinated slightly more than 5% of its population of 30 million, data compiled by Reuters showed.

343,Why are coups making a comeback in Africa?,"(CNN) In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.

These power grabs threaten a reversal of the democratization process Africa has undergone in the past two decades and a return to the era of coups as the norm.

Different decade, same problems

In the early postcolonial decades when coups were rampant, Africa's coup leaders virtually always offered the same reasons for toppling governments: corruption, mismanagement, poverty.

The leader of Guinea's recent coup , Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, echoed these justifications, citing ""poverty and endemic corruption"" as reasons for overthrowing 83 year old president Alpha Conde. The soldiers who led a coup in neighbouring Mali last year claimed ""theft"" and "" bad governance "" prompted their actions. Likewise, the Sudanese and Zimbabwean generals who toppled Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and Robert Mugabe in 2017 respectively, deployed similar arguments.

While well-worn, these justifications still resonate with many Africans today for the simple reason they continue to accurately depict the reality of their countries. Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening.

The research network Afrobarometer conducted surveys across 19 African countries which showed 6 in 10 respondents saying corruption is increasing in their country (the figure was 63% in Guinea) while 2 in 3 say their governments are doing a poor job fighting it.

Furthermore, 72% believe ordinary citizens ""risk retaliation or other negative consequences"" if they report corruption to authorities, a sign Africans believe their public institutions are not just partakers in, but active defenders of, corrupt systems.

When it comes to poverty, an already tragic situation has been worsened by the battering Africa's fragile economies took from the coronavirus pandemic.

This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.

These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.

But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. ""The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action... and I'm not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,"" he says.

Threat to democratic gains

What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want.

Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure ""MPs reflect voters' views"" and to ""enable voters remove non-performing leaders.""

In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies.

Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.

Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent , from Uganda's Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d'Ivoire.

The African Union is rightly condemning Guinea's coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted.

These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day.

It is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new.

We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred.

Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.

This increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation.

Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves.

They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today's African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/africa/africa-coups-resurgence-intl-cmd/index.html
344,How children were used in a 48-hour deadly rampage for gold,"(CNN) The men were shot as they slept outside, having spent their days underground, choking in the Sahel dust, digging and panning for gold.

They were killed by children -- some apparently as young as 12 -- and men who had arrived on dozens of motorbikes and were egged on in their murderous spree by women who knew the village well, according to witnesses. The local militia had left. The army came to the rescue for a matter of hours in the morning but then left before dusk, letting the attackers return the following night to burn the village down and most likely steal what gold it had.

In the end, somewhere between 170 and 200 people died, according to estimates by a local police source and other officials, and it still remains unclear who the killers were.

The massacre in Solhan , northern Burkina Faso, took place over two nights of extraordinary brutality in June 2021. The killings soon faded from international headlines, absorbed into the rhythms of persistent violence in the Sahel region, an arid stretch of land sandwiched by the Sahara Desert and the African savannah, and wracked by the climate emergency.

In the lawless and remote communities of the Sahel, jihadists increasingly hold sway. Yet one likely culprit in this incident, al Qaeda's local affiliate JNIM, condemned the attack's brutality. And the other main suspect, ISIS , chose to blame it on al Qaeda, according to an ISIS-affiliated newspaper.

Dozens of interviews by CNN with survivors, local witnesses and Burkina Faso officials paint the most complete and disturbing narrative yet of a rampage perpetrated over 48 hours, partially by children, that the US-backed and trained Burkina Faso military was powerless to stop.

Yet few officials or witnesses agree on a coherent and consistent motive for the attack. Were the child attackers sent for Solhan's gold, as currency for their Islamist masters? Was it a punishment killing ordered by jihadists against villagers loyal to the government?

The story of Solhan is a notable mark in the patina of brutality spreading across the Sahel. The intervention -- and now ongoing drawdown -- of the French military, the arrival of European Union forces, and the Pentagon's sustained support mean billions have been spent in attempts to bolster the local security forces. Yet violence has spiraled instead, particularly in Burkina Faso over recent years.

The crisis in some of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest states presents an imminent threat to Europe's security, and by extension the United States, analysts say, in providing a secure and spacious breeding ground for terror networks. US officials have described the ""wildfire of terrorism"" in the Sahel, with al Qaeda and ISIS ""on the march"" in West Africa, aiming to ""carve out a new caliphate.""

Illicit gold has emerged as a key source of funding for jihadist groups, who have been seizing so-called ""informal mines"" -- small-scale mining sites which rely largely on physical labor and basic technology to extract precious metals and minerals -- in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, according to a Crisis Group report from 2019.

In this file photo taken in February 2020, miners work at a gold mine in Bouda, Burkina Faso. A growing number of small-scale gold miners are out of work in Burkina Faso as jihadists try to seize control of the country's most lucrative industry.

Bachir Ismael Ouédraogo, Burkina Faso's minister of energy and mines, told CNN the country lost 20 tons of gold through informal mining and exports every year, worth roughly $1 billion on the open market.

Ouédraogo describes it as a ""war economy,"" a system that uses well-coordinated routes across the African continent. ""The gold you end up buying is financing terrorism, and affecting our families here,"" he added.

The first night: Massacre

Trapped in the arid plains around 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the capital Ouagadougou, Solhan's gold is the village's only asset, and its curse.

Satellite images of the village show the damage that informal mining has done to the terracotta soil -- the charred grey tailings and spoil from the intense activity of men who spend so many hours digging underground that they must sleep outdoors to recover.

A satelite view of the site of the attack on Solhan in Burkina Faso.

A local government-backed militia called the VDP (a French acronym meaning Volunteers for the Defense of the Country) provides some security. Yet on the night of June 4, Solhan was left mostly defenseless.

More than 100 jihadists, on dozens of tricycles and motorbikes, had been spotted 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Solhan that afternoon, according to Boureima Ly, the emir of the local region of Yagha.

The army was warned of a possible attack, but it was unclear if it would target Solhan or nearby Sebba -- according to Aly Bokoum, an activist with the Sahel Regional Youth Council in Burkina Faso -- so the local unit chose to stay in Sebba, where it is based. The VDP in Solhan also contacted the army about the threat but were told to leave the village, according to Bokoum.

There were women who came and instructed the children on who to kill. A police source

CNN has made multiple attempts to contact Burkina Faso's army for comment.

Gold appeared to set the attackers' priorities. Mines at Mousiga, a tiny settlement to Solhan's east, were hit first, according to a mining official and a miner who were present. Many of the survivors, witnesses and officials requested anonymity for their safety.

""Their faces were hidden with scarves,"" the miner said of the assailants. ""There were many of them on bikes and they started shooting. I started running for my life -- for 30 kilometers, all night, to safety."" This miner said he did not see children among this group and two other officials denied the involvement of children at the Mousiga mines.

The distant gunfire from Mousiga was misinterpreted by the Solhan miners, who ""thought it was the army coming"" on a routine patrol and so ""stayed next to their wells,"" said the mining official. The attackers then hit a VDP base on the road into the village, before moving on to their main target.

On entering Solhan, the convoy of children, women and likely some men split. One group turned left towards the mines. Another drove calmly into the center of the village.

A local shop in Solhan was completely destroyed in the attack.

The first shots in Solhan, heard by witnesses at 2:08 a.m., were at the mines, the police source said. ""The gold-diggers were first ... ambushed ... killed at random,"" he said, while describing the typical night-time scene. ""Most of the [miners] sleep outside, on site. They can't sleep indoors, and they don't go home either. Usually only a few of them get into the well late at night, and most come out because of the heat.""

One miner said some victims were shot dead as they slept outside and others were slaughtered as they worked, trapped underground. ""All [the attackers] found outside were people sleeping,"" he said. ""That's what made it possible for them to massacre them like that.""

Another miner said: ""People started coming out of the pits and running ... running for our lives."" He added that others hid inside the 30-foot-deep wells.

We saw the light from the bullets all over the place. It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all. A survivor of the attack

The mining official described how a large gun was positioned beneath a nearby tree for use in the attack. ""Many ran away, but when you run, you're going to be seen and they shoot,"" he said, adding that some miners survived by hiding in the pits until 8 a.m. ""The first person who went down to the site [the following day] called me, and said the bodies were lying like fish,"" the official said.

Several witnesses and officials told CNN that the attackers had in-depth knowledge of Solhan's layout. ""These are people who take the time to study their target,"" confirmed the police source, who said witnesses mentioned distinctly hearing women's voices among the attackers. ""They indicated to 'go to into this guy's house, do this and that,' and told children to 'go here and there,' that they couldn't let one person leave,"" the source said.

Local activist Abdou Hoeffi, from the human rights group Burkina Faso Movement for Human and People's Rights (MBDHP), said the women played a cheerleading role with the child assailants, with shouts of: ""You are a good shooter! You go!""

One witness, who said his parents were killed in the attack, told CNN in Solhan: ""They came with women and little children holding guns. Francois, a shopkeeper, he was taken away, my friend. If it was a man, they killed him -- a boy, they kidnapped him. A little one like that,"" he said, gesturing the embrace of an infant in his arms, ""who was breastfeeding [was taken away]. His mother lost her mind.""

The road leading into Solhan. The attackers arrived on motorbikes, according to eyewitnesses.

One Solhan woman, her bright blue dress glistening as she sifted grains through a sieve, described surviving the night: ""They destroyed everything ... I fled into my house with my child on my back ... I couldn't sleep all night. We saw the light from the bullets all over the place ... It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all.""

Another witness said he and his wife were in bed with their 5-day-old baby when they heard the gunfire. ""Three terrorists passed by my house, in front of me, talking. They did not stop. I could see the bullets raining down everywhere in the night."" The witness, a former security guard for the local cellphone antenna, said the attackers disabled the phone mast that night and removed its battery, cutting the village off from the outside world and a chance of help.

The attackers left at dawn, and the same witness said that the villagers started to venture outside again by 5 a.m. ""I couldn't count the number of corpses that were on the side of the road,"" he recalled. ""Everywhere you go, there are bodies lying around.""

The mine was also an apocalyptic scene. ""We found that everyone died at the well. I made up to eight trips with a motorcycle cab to carry corpses,"" said another survivor."" The mining official added that ""everyone was loaded on and off the motorbikes like bags of grain.""

The area around the mine at Solhan was left damaged.

Then the army finally arrived. One miner told CNN the attackers depended on the military's slow reaction when launching their assault. ""This is Burkina Faso. There is no fast response,"" the miner said. ""If they knew that in 30 or 40 minutes the army would come, they wouldn't [attack]. But they took all their time.""

When the military did arrive, there was little to do but bury the dead, he said. ""They dug a big hole. There was no other solution.""

The ex-phone antenna guard said the security forces asked villagers ""to go back home and lock the door, and to not hide any terrorists.""

Six bodies were found at this location after the attack on Solhan in June 2021.

Two officials said the militants' convoy did not really leave at first light but instead relocated to a hideout in the brush, and waited. The mining official specified a remote border area where he believed they had hidden. The police source said it was not clear if they met leaders there for further instructions, or just waited for the cover of night.

Some of the villagers who remained in Solhan tried to flee, said the police source. ""They didn't know if it was over or not,"" he said. The hospital in the nearest city, Dori, was ""overwhelmed,"" he said. But it was unclear if the attackers were finished with Solhan. At dusk, the answer came.

The second night: Destruction

""I heard the sound of their motorcycles and said, 'Ah, they are [here] again,'"" one witness said. ""I went back to my yard, turned off the lights in my house, took my mat, took my blanket."" He said he left for another village -- traveling on foot with a group of Solhan's children, elderly residents and pregnant women.

But the convoy's focus was different this time: They wanted to eradicate or loot all that remained. ""They started to burn. They entered the houses,"" said one survivor. ""At the stores, they took clothes, drinks, money, put them in their vehicles.""

""They came back, they found four motorcycles at our place,"" another survivor said. ""They burned everything. They burned all our houses, until even the sheet metal was gone. They took rice, sugar, oil and boxes of other things.""

Showing a cameraman around what remained of his home, the survivor gestured to the devastation -- the walls black with soot, apart from a patch where the TV was fixed before it too was looted. ""The grenade went through the wall and went to the other side,"" he said, pointing at a missing patch of plaster. ""The whole roof is gone.""

The mining official said 80 sheep were also slaughtered in the violence.

Young men who survived the onslaught sought medication for the psychological trauma in nearby Dori, he added. ""They were given pills or injections, because they say they couldn't close their eyes, because they could still see the dead bodies.""

Video filmed in July shows the charred village clinic -- the hospital beds and consultation room beyond use. Shops and homes were incinerated, and rows of buildings left collapsed or with only their metal gates remaining. Motorcycles were torched. Even the mining machinery used to break rocks was half-smashed, yet in the video some of it still hummed around the mines that remained functioning.

Shell casings still lay on the ground. The scale of destruction -- fueled, it seemed, by something more nihilistic than just looting -- surprised some officials.

Shell casings were found at the site of the attack in Solhan.

Since June, officials, experts and survivors have been seeking to understand more about the massacre.

The government, facing protests in Dori over its inaction and security failings, blamed jihadists.

Government spokesperson Ousseni Tamboura told Radio France Internationale that two suspects had been detained before the attack and the arrests had led officials to link it to a little-known group called Mujahed al Qaeda, which is connected to the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM. Tamboura said gold was also a motivating factor. In the immediate aftermath, the government fired some security personnel and declared three days of national mourning.

Tamboura told CNN in November the government believes al Qaeda affiliate JNIM was behind the massacre. He put the death toll at 132, which includes attackers killed in the incident, and fatalities from a neighboring attack.

Tamboura declined to comment on the army's absence in Solhan that night, and said that the Burkina Faso military followed all protocols set between them and the US as a condition for aid. The spokesman added that the jihadi groups were fueled by hunger to control resources, not by ideology.

A French military intelligence official, who didn't want to be named discussing sensitive information, agreed that jihadists were likely responsible, saying the massacre was likely committed by a group ""in the process of being formed,"" linked to JNIM. The official said attacks against the general population, as indiscriminate as those on Solhan, were more the hallmark of ISIS, however.

Display of violence

Beds inside the local health clinic were burnt.

The display of violence has once again highlighted the rapid deterioration of social structures and security in the Sahel region.

A US intelligence official said: ""There is absolutely a continued need for Western involvement and engagement to address the expansion of the al Qaeda- and ISIS-based groups in the area and not give them complete freedom of movement -- as well as to build [the] capability [and] capacity of African partners.""

The US official added that the crisis seemed to be fueled by local partnerships between jihadists and not an influx of ISIS fighters from the collapse of the former ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They said that they have not noticed a broad trend of ISIS fighters moving from the Middle East to the Sahel area, with the exception of one or two persons of interest.

The official said the main concern was how ISIS affiliates across Africa were able to share tactics and build each other's capabilities.

""Whether it's physical facilitation capabilities from a group like ISIS Somalia with more skilled fighters [or] better media coordination from other groups, and being able to rapidly disseminate those capabilities more widely ... it is hugely concerning,"" they explained. ""You could take a group that is probably not very effective and make them very effective quickly, if they're able to leverage some of that skill set.""

In Burkina Faso and its Sahel neighbors Mali and Niger, armed Islamist groups have killed more than 800 civilians in attacks during 2021 alone, according to Human Rights Watch

Three days of mourning was declared in Burkina Faso after an August attack in the village of Gorgadji, about 50 kilometers west of Dori, where militants killed 80 people, reported Agence France-Presse

Fourteen soldiers were reportedly ambushed and killed in October near Yirgou, also in the north, the site of a similar attack that killed 15 police in June, according to Reuters

Gunmen killed dozens of people in another massacre in Yirgou in 2019, according to Amnesty International.

People protest on June 22, 2019 in front of the Ouagadougou courthouse to demand ""truth and justice"" for the victims of a terrorist attack in Yirgou that left 49 dead.

This rise in violence has occurred despite the US's enduring, low-profile military mission in Burkina Faso, which pumped in tens of millions of dollars in aid during 2018-19.

Yet significant swathes of Burkina Faso's volatile north remain outside of the government's control. Long-running accusations of abuses by the military have also complicated its relationship with its key military backers, specifically France and the US.

Human rights organizations also face difficulties in Burkina Faso. The government suspended the operations of the Norwegian Refugee Council in September after the humanitarian group noted the country's speed at registering displaced people.

For the police source, however, the massacre at Solhan was particularly methodical and unparalleled in its brutality. ""These are people who take the time to study their target,"" he said. ""It is painful to see a woman instructing a child to kill such and such. Painful.""

And for the survivors, the initial absence of the army, as well as its departure as night fell, are indications of the dark place they live in.

""If the [army] are not with the people, how is that possible?,"" one survivor said. ""As soon as the army left, [the attackers] came again. This is a strange country. It's a strange country.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/21/africa/solhan-burkina-faso-massacre-intl-cmd/index.html
345,Is British Vogue's latest cover the best way to celebrate Black beauty?,"Stephanie Busari , CNN Lagos, Nigeria Written by

Stephanie Busari is CNN's Supervising Editor for Africa based in Lagos, Nigeria. All opinions expressed in the article below are the author's own.

""Sis have you seen this wonderful cover ... it's amazing,"" a friend wrote to me in an Instagram message. It was the British Vogue February 2022 cover, which features an all-star team of African supermodels.

It is one of two cover photos released this month (a second cover image features one of the group, supermodel Adut Akech, posing alone) and, according to British Vogue's British Ghanaian editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, the images aim to spotlight the rise of the African models shaping the industry.

However, my heart sank when I saw the picture of the models. I wanted to love it, but the image left me confused and raised questions about the execution of this important cover.

Why are the models depicted in a dark and ominous tableau, the lighting so obscure to the point they are almost indistinguishable on a cover meant to celebrate their individuality? Why were they dressed all in black, giving a funereal air, and an almost ghoulish, otherworldly appearance?

Why were they sporting strangely-coiffed wigs? Many of these women wear their natural hair normally and it would have been great to see that reflected on a cover celebrating African beauty. Additionally, on the cover, the models' skin color appeared to be several shades darker than their normal skin tone.

The photographs were taken by Afro-Brazilian photographer Rafael Pavarotti, and the images -- published in numerous glossy magazines over the years -- are consistent with his visual style of presenting Black skin in an ultra-dark manner.

""This is a celebration of women, of matriarchy, and of the beauty of Black women,"" Pavarotti said of his first British Vogue cover shoot in an article accompanying the pictures online.

""They are the past, the present, and the future,"" he added.

But the lighting, styling, and makeup, which purposefully exaggerated the models' already dark skin tones, reduced their distinguishing features and presented a homogenized look. Was this the best way to celebrate Black beauty? Would it not have been better to let their natural, unique beauty shine through?

Pavarotti did not respond to requests for comment and Enninful declined CNN's request for an interview, while British Vogue has not responded publicly to the criticisms. A behind-the-scenes video of the shoot was released along with the cover images. Shot with more natural light, before the women are fully styled, the short clip reveals more individuality, and a variety of dark skin tones, in dramatic contrast to the final result.

In an article published on the Vogue website, Enninful describes the models (Adut Akech, Anok Yai, Majesty Amare, Amar Akway, Janet Jumbo, Maty Fall, Nyagua Ruea, Abény Nhial, and Akon Changkou) as ""a powerful cohort of reigning and emerging superstars who have not only come to rule catwalks and dominate campaigns but have shifted the lens through which fashion is seen the world over.""

He added: ""No longer just one or two dark-skinned girls mingled backstage, but a host of top models took a meaningful, substantial and equal place among the most successful women working in fashion today. It means so much to me to see it.""

'We want us as us'

A cover is the highest accolade a magazine can give to a subject, and, historically, Black women have rarely been bestowed this honor.



So, when Black women appear on the cover of global high-profile magazines like Vogue, these images circulate widely; we feel seen, celebrated, and acknowledged. That is why for many Black women, particularly dark-skinned ones like me, this Vogue cover feels personal. Former British Vogue editor-in-chief Alexandra Shulman famously noted in a 2017 interview in the Guardian that unknown Black women on the cover sold fewer copies.So, when Black women appear on the cover of global high-profile magazines like Vogue, these images circulate widely; we feel seen, celebrated, and acknowledged. That is why for many Black women, particularly dark-skinned ones like me, this Vogue cover feels personal.

When the February issue was first unveiled last week, I saw many people, like my friend, saying how stunning and beautiful it was. So, I took to Twitter to see if others were as conflicted as I was. Hundreds of people replied to my tweet say ing they found the images to be a poor representation of Black women.

What I found is that many of us want to love these images, but can't shake off a feeling of disquiet that is rooted in deeper issues around beauty standards that have excluded us for so long.



British Vogue under fire over February cover

Many online critics felt the images were fetishized and pandering to a White gaze, ironic, considering the editorial team behind them consisted almost entirely of people of African descent.

Ghanaian writer Natasha Akua wrote in a private message on Instagram: ""When I saw it I immediately was shocked ... I feel like I know what statement he was trying to make visually but turning these black models into this strange tableau straight out of a horror movie just felt instinctively wrong.""

""Why darken their skin beyond recognition?"" she asked. ""To make some statement about being unapologetically black? Unapologetically black means being who you are and does not require this manner of hyperbole.""

""I find the lighting and tones beautiful,"" Daniel Emuna wrote. ""But my personal complaint is that publications and brands are constantly communicating that the deepest darkest hue in complexion represents the truest essence of Blackness or even Africanness. This is clearly a mark of the white gaze.""

While South Sudanese stand-up comic and social commentator Akau Jambo wrote: ""This is not art, this is Black Skin Porn. Black Fetish. Reverse Bleaching.""

""This image is pure manipulation,"" he told me during phone conversation. ""This is what they do to South Sudanese models to tell a story about Africa and people are saying we don't understand the artist's perspective but you can tell a story and be projecting a false narrative.""

""We don't want you to make us the Black you want. We want us as us.""

It is undeniable that Enninful and his team have made excellent strides in championing diversity since he replaced Shulman as editor-in-chief of British Vogue. His first cover was the mixed-race model Adwoa Aboah and he has also featured Dame Judi Dench, who at 85 was the magazine's oldest cover star.

He dedicated the September 2020 issue cover to 20 activists, including Manchester United footballer and free school meals advocate Marcus Rashford, photographed by Misan Harriman -- the first Black man to shoot a British Vogue cover.

Many of the people who contacted me didn't want to criticize the February cover because of this work Enninful has done at Vogue, but we must not be afraid to hold even our African brothers and sisters accountable when it is needed.

Change doesn't happen overnight and open conversation and debate are essential as we make strides to achieve the representation that we all want to see.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/british-vogue-february-cover-african-models-lgs-intl/index.html
346,Senegal beats Egypt to win Africa Cup of Nations trophy,"(CNN) Senegal defeated Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations championship match on Sunday, winning the continental championship for the first time on penalty kicks at Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé, Cameroon.

Neither Senegal nor Egypt -- which had previously won the Africa Cup of Nations seven times, the most in the tournament's history -- were able to breakthrough in the first 90 minutes, with Senegal looking in control for most of the game before Egypt gained strength late in the second half.

Egypt's Marwan Hamdi, top, jumps for the ball with Senegal's Abdou Diallo during the African Cup of Nations 2022 final soccer match on Sunday, February 6, 2022.

The game's best opportunity at a goal in regulation time came in the early minutes of the match for Senegal. After an Egyptian foul in the penalty box, Liverpool star Sadio Mané's penalty kick was saved in spectacular fashion by goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal, also known as Gabaski, in the seventh minute.

But after 30 scoreless minutes of extra time, which featured a pair of stellar saves from Gabaski and Senegalese keeper Edouard Mendy, the game went to penalty kicks.

Another clutch save from Mendy set Mané up with a chance at redemption. Mané buried a rocket in the back of the net to give Senegal the championship.

347,'We've got a chance to win it all!': NBA superstar Joel Embiid discusses his love of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations,"(CNN) At approximately 11am on Saturday, January 29th, in the Philadelphia area of the United States, a 27-year-old man is intending to ease his seven-foot frame into a chair -- or perhaps remain standing -- and turn on the device of his choosing, to spend 90 minutes consumed by the events unfolding on a soccer field in his birthplace of Yaoundé, Cameroon.

Warning: People in the vicinity may hear cheering -- loud, loud cheering . The fact that said sounds could be emanating from one of the best basketball players on the planet merely adds to the intrigue.

When he's not playing Most Valuable Player-caliber ball for the Philadelphia 76ers -- and his definition of ""a bad night"" was a near triple-double of 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in a 105-87 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday -- five-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid is rooting for his nation of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which his homeland happens to be hosting.

Saturday's quarterfinal pits the Indomitable Lions against The Gambia in a match Embiid's team is expected to win. Victory would mean Cameroon is two games away from lifting a sixth AFCON title, with the most recent coming in 2017, the center's rookie year for the 76ers.

Embiid was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month just three days before Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-1 in the 2017 final; a match-up which, if all things fall into place, could happen again on Sunday, February 6th.

""The excitement level has always been huge,"" Embiid tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies about his love of the Cameroon national team dating back to childhood. ""The crazy thing is that when Cameroon would always play, anytime they would score, everybody would just scream. You could hear the whole country just scream.""

Joel Embiid is playing at an MVP level this season.

The love of the Lions

While his remarkable journey brought Embiid to America at the age of 16 -- first via high school and college in Florida and Kansas, and subsequently selected 3rd overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by Philadelphia -- he was born a few years after Cameroon's fairytale run to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.

The first African nation to advance to the last eight, a mere seven minutes away from reaching the final four, Cameroon eventually succumbed to England in extra-time. Along the way, the Indomitable Lions wowed the world, starting with the upset of reigning champion Argentina in the opening match.

""Obviously, Roger Milla kind of put us on the map,"" recalls Embiid about the then 38-year-old striker Milla scoring four times at Italia '90, gaining further fame for his trademark goal celebration of dancing by the corner flag.

""Going back through history and watching the games, and learning through the history before I was born, and obviously the celebration was a huge part of that history ... we have a lot of history coming from Cameroon, and any time I get the chance to kind of be part of it, I always enjoy.""

Embiid has watched all of Cameroon's matches at AFCON.

Embiid believes that the class of 2022 can reign supreme at Africa's showpiece tournament. ""We're playing at home so any time you've got the support from your home fans that usually adds a lot to your motivation to go on and win every single game,"" he observes.

""Playing at home is a huge advantage for us, and I think we've got a chance to win it all ... I'm excited to keep watching and keep supporting.""

Cameroon's success at AFCON notwithstanding, the fortunes of a football team pale in comparison to the deaths which occurred at the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé last Monday due to a stadium crush . At least eight people were killed and 38 injured during the Round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros

A somber Embiid says: ""I'm a man of God, so I pray for those families to find peace and also for their loved ones to find peace and be at peace. It is tragic that it happened and I'm extremely sorry for it."" Given the horrific events, what would it mean to Embiid and Cameroon if the team does go on to lift the trophy?

""As a country, we've been through a lot,"" he reveals. ""We haven't had any competition [held] over there for a long time, so to be able to finally get it and to be able to win, I think is going to be huge for us.""

Embiid tells CNN he's set his sights on winning the MVP award this season.

AFCON getting more credit

In the build up to AFCON 2022, there was discussion in some quarters that stars such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mané (Senegal), Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Paris Saint-Germain's Achraf Hakimi (Morocco) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal) temporarily leaving their club sides behind was such a bitter pill for their club sides and supporters to swallow, it overshadowed the prestige which comes from representing one's country, to say nothing of elevating the tournament to the levels attained across other continents.

Embiid follows European football closely, so does he concur that AFCON fails to get the credit it deserves on the global stage?

""It's messed up,"" Embiid quickly concludes. ""When it always comes to Africa, I feel like there's always kind of double standards. I never hear any complaints when it comes to the European Cup or any other cups.

""[AFCON]'s a little different because obviously it's going on during the season over there, and some of the best players, when you talk about someone like Mo Salah or Sadio [Mané] they're supposed to be playing for their clubs. But I also appreciate them wanting to just go back and represent their country, which is good.

""I think we're still earning our respect ... when you look at the success that Africa has in general, we have a lot of talent. Not just in football but in basketball or other sports too. Over time, we're going to overcome that but it's getting there slowly.""

As for the big man himself, when asked what would mean more to him -- Cameroon triumphing at AFCON or Embiid winning MVP -- he smiles. ""That's tough! I want both -- both would be great!

""It would have been a better question if you were to ask me between Cameroon winning or me winning a championship!"" Asked then which he would prefer, Embiid said, ""Both would be great, like I said, I'm a competitor -- I want to win.""

Embiid will be tuning in to watch Cameroon's quarterfinal against The Gambia.

After detailing the hard work Cameroon made of their previous opponents Comoros, as the continental minnows played much of the match with 10 men and the entire game with an outfield player in goal, Embiid gives a message to the team of his heart ahead of the challenges which await.

""Go out there and keep doing whatever they've been doing. At the end, they've been doing great. They have our full support to continue to do so and I really hope that they're able to keep that cup in our home territory, so I'm gonna keep supporting them. Like I said, I'm going to be watching the rest of the games.""

Will we see another iconic celebration like Embiid's Twitter video of Max Verstappen's maiden Formula One title if the Indomitable Lions pull off their sixth AFCON crown? ""I hope the excitement of when we get to the final is the same thing [as the F1 finale]. We might get one!""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/sport/joel-embiid-cameroon-afcon-football-76ers-spt-intl/index.html
348,Breakfast around the world: How different places start the day,"(CNN) — When it comes to breakfast foods around the world, there are as many ways to enjoy the first meal of the day as there are to say ""good morning.""

From creamy cornbread cake in Brazil and savory Tunisian chickpea soup to fluffy Ukrainian pancakes and sweet coconut jam toasts in Singapore, these 20 international specialties offer a food option for every palate.

And even if the flavors in some of these dishes might be unexpected based on your typical choices, the presentations are likely familiar. Read through CNN Travel's list -- in no particular order -- and learn about the delicious diversity of our world's breakfast cultures. Maybe you'll even find some inspiration for your next meal.

Switzerland

On weekdays, the Swiss frequently stick to quick but filling breakfasts such as the traditional birchermüesli, the granola-style blend of oats with fruit and nuts that's usually served over thick yogurt.

But on weekends, it's time for Swiss brunch. Along with roesti (potato pancakes), cheeses and cold cuts, the centerpiece of the brunch table is zopf. This braided egg bread is similar to challah or brioche, and served with honey, butter and jam.

Ethiopia

Genfo is a thick porridge made with barley, wheat and corn flour, and it's a traditional porridge. Shutterstock

When you're having qurs (that's ""breakfast"" in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language), chances are you'll be eating porridge. While there are many varieties and names for hot grain cereals served throughout the country, savory genfo is one of the most popular.

Genfo is made by mixing barley flour with boiling water until a thick, sticky dough forms, then shaped into a mound with a well in the center. The well is then filled with clarified butter blended with berbere, the complex spice blend, and dollops of yogurt are often spooned around the edges of the genfo.

Japan

Japanese breakfasts fall squarely on the savory side of the food spectrum: In fact, much of what you can eat for breakfast in Japan wouldn't be out of place at any other meal of the day.

Many morning repasts consist of a selection of small plates, each with a few bites of a traditional Japanese dish.

Fish such as salmon or mackerel, miso soup, pickled vegetables and rice are all represented. There's also tamagoyaki, a slightly sweet rolled omelet made from thin layers of egg in a rectangular pan that gives it its signature shape.

Iceland

Start your day in Iceland with a jolt of life-giving lysi: cod liver oil, a plentiful source of omega-3 fatty acids and one of the byproducts of the country's fish industry. Though it's been said to combat seasonal affective disorder, among other health benefits, it's not the only breakfast option.

For a more palatable morning meal, have a bowl of hafragrautur, a thick oatmeal. Top it with nuts, raisins and sugar, or add a helping of skyr, the thick yogurt-like cultured dairy product that's actually a fresh cheese.

Singapore

The multitude of dishes served in the hawker centers entice the appetite in this Asian city-state. These open-air food courts are always open for business, and it's not uncommon to see hungry people scooping up bowls of savory curry noodles first thing in the morning.

For a traditional hawker-style breakfast, kaya toast is a must-have. This unassuming-looking toasted sandwich is spread with flavorful kaya, a sweet jam made with coconut milk, eggs and sometimes pandan leaf for vibrant green color and flavor.

It's great with coffee or tea, and each stall or shop makes kaya toast its own way -- so why not try a few?

Morocco

Along with mint tea, semolina breads are mainstays on the Moroccan breakfast table. Baghrir are thin, yeasted rounds studded with tiny holes that give them the name ""thousand-hole pancakes"" or ""thousand-hole crepes."" Instead of maple syrup, these light semolina breads are topped with butter and honey.

Harcha are thicker, griddled biscuit-style rounds that have a crispy crust from a dusting of coarse semolina. They can be split like English muffins and served with cheese or butter, jam, and honey.

Australia

Australian breakfasts range, but a mainstay is avocado toast topped with an egg. Ben Kolde/Unsplash

For those who love grain bowls, avocado and other savory toasts, and other staples of all-day café culture, Australia's ""brekkie"" will be a match made in heaven.

With a focus on fresh produce, whole grains and nourishing combinations, Australian breakfasts can range from the classic avocado toast on seeded bread to a farro bowl topped with a poached egg and pickled vegetables or rice pudding with yogurt, seeds and berries.

Don't forget the flat white -- an espresso with a high ratio of steamed milk that even Starbucks can't get enough of.

Argentina

There's one word that defines the Argentinean breakfast spread: facturas. The overarching term for pastries encompasses a sweet and doughy world of shapes, sizes and flavors.

Some of the more popular offerings include medialunes, a croissant-shaped brioche pastry; bombas and bolas de fraille, or fried doughnuts; and churros, which are often dipped in chocolate. Many are filled with dulce de leche or crema pastelera, a vanilla custard.

Pair a platter of facturas with highly caffeinated yerba mate or coffee.

Germany

In the land of many wurst, it's not surprising that sausage and other meats take a starring role in frühstück, the traditional German breakfast.

This buffet spread is filled with variety: sausages, cold cuts, cheeses, bread and rolls (including pretzels), as well as fresh fruit, soft-boiled eggs and condiments such as homemade jam. The abundant choices are meant for sampling and assembling as you please.

Brazil

If you can't stop eating pao de queijo, the puffy baked cheese rolls that are a staple of Brazilian culture, you'll be happy to know you can eat them for breakfast, too.

But for a variation on Brazilian breakfast breads, try bolo de fuba. It's a cornbread-style cake with a moist and creamy texture that comes from the addition of grated Parmesan cheese and/or shredded coconut. Sliced and served like a pound cake, it's frequently an afternoon pick-me-up too.

Tunisia

Fans of savory meals will love lablabi, a spiced chickpea soup that, yes, is a breakfast food in Tunisia. Chickpeas and harissa paste are the two constants in virtually every lablabi recipe, but the customizations of this simple, soul-warming soup are up to every cook.

Sometimes thickened with pieces of stale crusty bread, sometimes brightened by a squeeze of a lemon, sometimes made creamy with yogurt or topped with olives, there are infinite ways to enjoy it.

And because it's often topped with a poached egg, it's a breakfast that will fill you up all day.

Bulgaria

Popara follows in the long tradition of using leftover bread as the next day's meal. This warm, comforting breakfast is a childhood favorite of many Bulgarians -- it's not quite a porridge and not quite a bread pudding, but shares characteristics of both.

Warm milk or tea is poured over a bowl of cubed bread, crumbled Bulgarian sirene cheese, butter and sugar, and left to soak until soft and spoonable.

Sirene is a feta-style cheese that's creamier and softer than many of the Eastern European brined cheeses, so it doesn't give the dish as much of a salty flavor and more of a fresh, goat cheese-like tanginess.

Turkey

Kahvalti, the traditional Turkish breakfast spread, is a lavish affair that has a little something for everyone. For those who love to graze and snack, the abundant options will leave nothing lacking.

Turkish breads such as simit, a circular seeded loaf, or pide, a chewy flatbread, accompany bowls of feta or other fresh, salty cheeses; olives; halvah; and honey and preserves. Eggs are often cooked with pan-fried slices of sucuk, a dried beef sausage spiced with garlic, red pepper, cumin and sumac.

Guam

This small island -- technically an American territory -- In the Pacific Ocean is a melting pot of culinary culture, with foods that show the influence of the various countries that colonized the land over the centuries.

Like many Asian Pacific nations, Spam is a favorite add-in for breakfasts of fried rice and eggs. But just as popular is the local chamorro pork sausage, a fresh chorizo-style sausage named after the indigenous population of the island. Grilled in links or patties, it's breakfast sausage like no other.

Portugal

Portugal's egg custard tarts pair perfectly with the caffeinated beverage of your choice. Shutterstock

Coffee drinks with lots of milk are the first order of business when getting breakfast in Portugal. Uma mei de leite, a half-and-half blend of coffee and milk, or um galao, which is mostly milk with a shot of coffee, are an easy way to ease into the day.

Though many Portuguese have a simple piece of toast or bread alongside their drink, the perfect pairing for these milky coffees are pasteis de nata, or egg custard tarts. With a flaky puff pastry shell and a creamy custard filling, they're equally popular as a snack for the 11 a.m. cafe break, another Portuguese morning ritual.

Ukraine

Tender and fluffy on the inside and crispy golden brown on the outside, Ukrainian syrniki pancakes wouldn't be out of place on a five-star brunch buffet.

Yet they're made with a simple ingredient: fresh farmer's cheese, known as tvorog, with a consistency similar to ricotta or cottage cheese. The crisp exterior comes from a quick dredge in flour, like a breakfast fritter.

Like American pancakes or French toast, they can be topped with fresh fruit, preserves or powdered sugar, but like potato pancakes or blintzes, they can go savory with a side of sour cream.

Jamaica

For breakfast in Jamaica, it couldn't get more patriotic than eating the national dish: ackee and saltfish.

Ackee, a delicately sweet pear-shaped fruit, is sautéed with salt cod, tomatoes, garlic, chilies and onion in a breakfast scramble that brings together sweet, salty and spicy for a one-of-a-kind island taste. Though it looks similar to scrambled eggs, that's just the creamy yellow ackee, Jamaica's national fruit, in the dish.

Taiwan

While a glass of milk is often advertised in the US as ""part of a balanced breakfast,"" dòu jiāng takes the tradition to new levels. This fresh soy milk is a specialty of Taiwan, typically made fresh by street vendors and restaurants every morning for their customers.

Served hot in the winter and cold in the summer, it's a refreshing contrast to the chewy scallion pancakes, dumplings and dough fritters that are also part of the usual Taiwanese breakfast. Dip your fritters in the soy milk for an extra treat.

Italy

Italians are almost too busy for breakfast -- or so you'd think from the number of coffee bars where guests take their espresso standing up for a quick jolt at the beginning of the day.

But whether standing or relaxing for a moment at a café table, there's always time for a coffee and Italian pastry to go with it. For the morning, espresso or cappuccino is frequently paired with a simple sweet such as a cornetto, or croissant, filled with custard or Nutella.

Sfogliatelle, a crunchy and flaky multilayered pastry with a sweet ricotta cheese filling, is another breakfast standard.

United States of America

349,A viral image of a Black fetus is highlighting the need for diversity in medical illustrations,"(CNN) At first glance, the image looks like a standard drawing that could easily be found in the pages of a medical textbook or on the walls of a doctor's office.

But what sets apart the illustration of a fetus in the womb that recently captured the attention of the internet is a simple, yet crucial, detail: its darker skin tone.

The image, created by Nigerian medical student and illustrator Chidiebere Ibe, struck a chord with countless people on social media, many of whom said that they had never seen a Black fetus or a Black pregnant woman depicted before. It also brought attention to a larger issue at hand: A lack of diversity in medical illustrations

(While most fetuses are red in color -- newborns come out dark pink or red and only gradually develop the skin tone they will have for life -- the medical illustration is intended to represent patients who aren't used to seeing their skin tones in such images.)

Ibe said in an interview with HuffPost UK that he didn't expect to receive such an overwhelming response -- his fetus illustration was one of many such images he's created as a medical illustrator, most of which depict Black skin tones. But it underscored the importance of a mission he's long been committed to.

""The whole purpose was to keep talking about what I'm passionate about -- equity in healthcare -- and also to show the beauty of Black people,"" he told the publication. ""We don't only need more representation like this -- we need more people willing to create representation like this.""

CNN reached out to Ibe for comment, but he did not expand on the topic further.

Ni-Ka Ford, diversity committee chair for the Association of Medical Illustrators, said that the organization was grateful for Ibe's illustration.

""Along with the importance of representation of Black and Brown bodies in medical illustration, his illustration also serves to combat another major flaw in the medical system, that being the staggering disproportionate maternal mortality rate of Black women in this country,"" she wrote in an email to CNN.

What medical illustration is

Medical illustrations have been used for thousands of years to record and communicate procedures, pathologies and other facets of medical knowledge, from the ancient Egyptians to Leonardo da Vinci . Science and art are combined to translate complex information into visuals that can communicate concepts to students, practitioners and the public. These images are used not just in textbooks and scientific journals, but also films, presentations and other mediums.

There are fewer than 2,000 trained medical illustrators in the world, according to the Association of Medical Illustrators . With only a handful of accredited medical illustration programs in North America, which tend to be expensive and admit few students, the field has historically been dominated by people who are White and male -- which, in turn, means the bodies depicted have usually been so, too.

""Historically [medical illustrations] have always featured white able bodied male figures and still do in the present day,"" Ford said. ""Bias towards one body type in medical illustration marginalizes everyone else.""

About 3% of the images analyzed showed disabled bodies, while just 2% featured elderly people. Studies have backed up this lack of diversity. Researchers at the University of Wollogong in Australia found in a 2014 study that out of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex across 17 anatomy textbooks published between 2008 and 2013, just 36% of the depicted bodies were female. A vast majority were White.About 3% of the images analyzed showed disabled bodies, while just 2% featured elderly people.

Why diversity in the field matters

Diversity in the field of medical illustrations (or lack thereof) matters because these images can have implications for medical trainees, practitioners and patients.

""Without equitable representation and the perpetual use of only white able bodied patients depicted in medical textbooks, medical professionals are limited in their ability to accurately diagnose and treat people who don't fit that mold,"" Ford said. ""Medical professionals can then tend to rely on racial stereotypes and generalizations because of this knowledge gap on how symptoms present differently on darker skin tones, leading to poorer care.""

A study by the same University of Wollogong researchers published in 2018 found that gender-biased images from anatomy textbooks increased medical students' scores on implicit bias tests. Another study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery -- Global Open in 2019 found that White patients were overrepresented in the images of plastic surgery journals, which the authors suggested could potentially influence the care non-White patients received.

""For decades, peer-reviewed academic publications have used photographs and images that inadequately portray the diversity in demographics of patients affected by particular diseases,"" the researchers wrote. ""This is particularly striking in the lack of diversity in medical illustration. These inequities in medical reporting can have lasting downstream effects on the accessibility and provision of healthcare.""

Ford said that those who aren't often depicted in medical illustrations ""can feel left out and unacknowledged in a healthcare setting, leading to feelings of distrust and isolation when receiving care."" She also said that medical professionals might feel less empathy for groups who aren't represented -- people who are Black, brown, women, transgender or nonbinary -- which can lessen the quality of care they receive.

Despite the persistent need for medical illustrations to depict the full scope of human diversity, the field is beginning to see changes, medical illustrator Hillary Wilson told CNN.

Wilson, whose illustrations depict Black people in infographics about eczema, sun damage, alopecia and other conditions, said both patients and practitioners could benefit from seeing diversity represented in medical illustrations. And through her work, she's attempting to humanize people of color and other marginalized groups by doing just that.

""The reality is that there are so many different types of people that exist,"" she said. ""To me, a resource isn't complete if I didn't at least consider that and try my best to account for the fact that there are so many different types of people.""

While Ibe's image of the Black fetus seemed to mark a departure from the norm, Wilson said she hopes that in the future, seeing Black skin tones in medical illustrations will become routine.

""Eventually, I hope it can just become one of the things that's expected,"" she added.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/09/health/black-fetus-medical-illustration-diversity-wellness-cec/index.html
350,How these companies going green in Ghana could pay off for the country and the planet,"(CNN) Across Ghana's industries, from energy to agriculture, companies are using tech to go green. Earlier this year, the country's government pledged to create up to $2 billion in green bonds, which it says will help pay for environmental priorities and pave the road to sustainability.

Meanwhile, companies such as Trashy Bags Africa have already been focused on an eco-friendly business model.

In a country that generates 1.1 million metric tons of plastic waste each year, the Accra-based company has turned over 40 million plastic sachets (small bags filled with drinking water) into products such as laptop covers, pencil cases and grocery bags since 2007.

""We are creating employment, and also saving our environment,"" said Bright Biney, Trashy Bags country manager. ""If it's good for the planet, then it's good for business.""

351,ColdHubs: How solar-powered cold storage is keeping food fresh in Nigeria,"Call to Earth is a CNN initiative in partnership with Rolex. Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu is a Rolex Awards Laureate.

(CNN) In the bustling Ogere Market in Ogun State, Nigeria, the race is on to sell fresh produce early in the day. By noon, the sun is at its peak, and with temperatures soaring, food spoils fast. As the day wears on, food can sell at less than half of its original value, slashing profits for retailers and farmers.

That's why Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu decided to take a fresh approach to food waste. He's the founder of ColdHubs, which provides solar-powered food storage units designed for markets and farms.

The 39-year-old has won countless awards for the initiative and has just been announced as the joint winner of the $1.5 million AYuTe Africa Challenge , for promising young innovators who are using technology to reimagine food production on the continent.

352,Pritzker Prize 2022: Francis Kéré becomes first African to win 'Nobel of architecture',"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

When he was 7 years old, Francis Kéré left his family home to attend school because his village, Gando in Burkina Faso, did not have one of its own. Thirteen years later he moved to Germany on a carpentry scholarship with a dream of returning home one day to build the classrooms that didn't then exist.

Kéré achieved just that, becoming an architect and completing his first building, Gando Primary School, in 2001. The project proved to be a springboard for his career and still guides his ethos today. Having further transformed his village and other communities across Africa with his socially minded designs, the 56-year-old has now been named among the greats of his profession.

On Tuesday, organizers of the Pritzker Prize, often dubbed the ""Nobel of architecture,"" revealed Kéré as its 2022 laureate.

The first African architect to claim the award in its 43-year history, Kéré achieved the feat with a portfolio consisting largely of schools, health centers and community facilities -- projects that might once have been considered too modest for a prize that has historically honored the designers of iconic buildings. Speaking to CNN shortly after hearing the news, he credited his success to his community in Gando.

""This is not just a prize for myself,"" he said on the phone from Berlin, Germany, where he headquartered his firm, Kéré Architecture. ""Without having the courage to go back home, and to get my people to join me on the journey to build the school that (launched) my career, this would never have been be possible.""

Casting mud like concrete and embracing local materials over imported ones, Kéré proposes a vision of architecture that both strengthens communities and responds to the climate crisis. As such, Tuesday's Pritzker Prize announcement is not only a nod of approval for him, but for ""vernacular"" architecture -- a term used to describe designs that directly respond to local climates, materials and building traditions -- itself.

Though Kéré has since designed bigger projects, including large-scale campuses and two national parliaments, his approach remains grounded in principles established in Gando. Raising funds for the school from overseas, the architect returned to his village with plans for a contemporary and sustainable 5,600-square-foot facility. Knowing the village had no access to electricity or air conditioning, he proposed strategically placed windows that allow indirect sunlight to enter while generating airflow that serves as natural ventilation.

But despite collaborating closely with local craftspeople, Kéré said he faced resistance over his choice of materials. The use of traditional clay bricks, which -- even when fortified with concrete -- offer natural cooling, was not entirely welcomed by villagers, who thought the structure would not withstand the rainy season as well as glass and steel. The villagers' instinct to conflate modern materials and notions of progress is something that the architect has encountered throughout his career.

""There is still a feeling that everything that's local is primitive,"" he said. ""Let's say 90% of people in Burkina Faso use clay, but they see it as a 'poor person's material.' So, when they have more money to spend, they try to look for other materials.""

""Sometimes the Western world -- and how it communicates -- makes things in the West (appear to) be the best. And they are perceived by others to be the best, without taking into account that local materials can be the solution to the climate crisis and can be our best alternative in terms of socio-economic (development).

""The more local materials you use, the better you can promote the local economy and (build) local knowledge, which also makes people proud.""

Empowering communities

In the two decades since completing his breakout project in Gando, Kéré has realized plans for a village library, housing for teachers and a 2008 extension that significantly increased the school's capacity. He has also adapted his approach to different contexts in Burkina Faso, where he has completed almost a dozen projects, and across the continent, from Senegal to Uganda, Togo to Sudan.

At the Benga Riverside Residential Community in Mozambique, Kéré incorporated existing baobab trees, shrubs and native grasses in his design, offering shade and protecting houses from dusty winds. His curvilinear SKF-RTL Children Learning Centre in Kenya, meanwhile, was built from compressed earth bricks that were produced on-site.

In each case, his work is as much about process as design. Working with local craftspeople not only imparts ownership over community buildings, Kéré said, but it helps develop vocational skills that can be used to generate future income. As this year's Pritzker Prize jury, chaired by 2016 winner Alejandro Aravena , wrote of Kéré in its citation: ""He knows, from within, that architecture is not about the object but the objective; not the product, but the process.""

Kéré's background in carpentry makes him as much a builder as an architect. ""Hand-crafting, and cutting or putting materials together, was something that fascinated me,"" he said. ""And I try -- even without knowing it -- to do the same with my architecture.""

Yet, he sees a growing divide between design and construction, believing that many of today's architects are alienated from the processes that bring their visions to life.

""There's a big disconnection,"" Kéré said. ""You have people just sitting in an office with a computer designing and shaping our world. This is not the best approach... If you have a big (architecture) firm, then it's good to find a way to give people experience on construction sites.

""It doesn't take a miracle; it's possible. And we need to be aware that young professionals who (spend time) on construction sites, and really see how materials are put together, will have a different approach to design than those who just design on their computers.""

Growing profile

If Kéré's philosophy is instinctively practical, he clearly recognizes the power of symbols and visual identities. Take, for instance, his recently completed Startup Lions Campus, an education center in northeast Kenya whose distinctive towers both aid ventilation and mimic the region's termite mounds, rooting the structure in its surroundings.

Then there was the tree-inspired pavilion he designed for London's Serpentine Galleries, which each year invites a leading international architect to produce a temporary installation. Part of a growing body of Kéré's work outside Africa, the conceptual creation brought together various ideas underpinning his work, from perforated wooden blocks that produced natural air circulation to a rain-collecting canopy that alluded to the challenges of water scarcity.

Kéré's growing international profile has invited increasingly monumental commissions. After Burkina Faso's national assembly was destroyed during civil unrest in 2014, the architect was asked to envision a replacement in the country's capital, Ouagadougou. The stepped facade of his pyramidical design offers both public space and a message of democratic openness, though the project remains on hold in the aftermath of January's coup d'état

Construction of another Kéré's national assemblies, in neighboring Benin, is however underway. Like his Serpentine Pavilion, its top-heavy form was inspired by trees -- in this case, West Africa's palaver tree -- and their role as traditional meeting places, with the parliament's main volume blooming out from a hollow ""trunk.""

In both cases, Kéré said, the challenge was to create uniquely African expressions of democracy, memory and identity. But while these national-scale projects differ in size from the architect's schools and health centers, his approach remains rooted in localism.

""How do you make a project represent a nation? From a village to a nation state, you need to look around the country and ask, 'Where do you have local and natural stone ... and then we go to source it, in order (not to borrow) a style from somewhere else.

""This is how I'm trying to translate the work I have started in Gando to structures that present national pride.""

Kéré will officially be named Pritzker laureate at a ceremony in London later this year. As with previous winners, he will be awarded a $100,000 grant and a bronze medal.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/pritzker-prize-2022-francis-kere/index.html
353,"The East African Safari Classic: 'It's just about you, the road and your maker'","(CNN) When Eric Bengi was a boy, his father would wake him in the dead of night just to see the cars. Around 3 a.m. they would arrive at his village, Chogoria in central Kenya. In the wet -- it was usually wet -- the cars would fly past, sometimes sideways, headlights blaring, before roaring off into the dark. No sooner had they come than they'd gone, but the impression they left on the young boy lasted much longer than the tire tracks in the mud.

As an adult, Bengi leads a double life. Most days he's a lawyer in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. But on others he trades in his legal pad for a jumpsuit and crash helmet. That's when life comes at him fast. In a car older than he is, Bengi is willing to race for thousands of miles across some of the world's toughest rally driving terrain, pushing himself to the very limits in the name of motorsport glory. ""It's just about you, the road and your maker,"" he says.

Rally driving is in Bengi's blood as it is for many Kenyans, where the sport has deep and abiding roots. But drivers behind the wheel have not always reflected the sport's audience. This year Bengi and his navigator Mindo Gatimu became the first all-indigenous Kenyan team to compete in the East African Safari Classic, one of the nation's most celebrated rally events.

The 1959 Coronation Rally, a precursor for the East African Classic Rally which first took place in 1953.

The race has its origins in the inaugural East African Coronation Rally in 1953, in honor of Queen Elizabeth II, when Kenya was still part of the British Empire. It was conceived by cousins Eric Cecil and Neil Vincent , raced between Kenya, Uganda and part of present-day Tanzania , and timed to finish as the new queen was being crowned at Westminster Abbey, London.

The Coronation Rally became the East African Safari Rally in 1960 and was added to the World Rally Championship (WRC) calendar during the following decade before being dropped in 2003 and continuing as an independent event.

354,"How 'Amapiano', South Africa's soulful sound, has become one of the hottest new music genres","(CNN) A distinct sound is currently vibing on social feeds around the world: the deep house, log-drum driven basslines and soulful piano melodies of ""Amapiano."" While Amapiano dance challenges are currently sweeping TikTok, the streets of South Africa have been thrumming with its sound for years.

Seeping out of car windows and overflowing from clubs, Amapiano is more than a genre of music -- it is influencing style and dance and making an impact on South Africa's music industry. Believed to have started in 2012, this underground trend exploded in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been on the rise ever since.

""We noticed a lot of our youths at the end of 2019 starting to use Amapiano music to create their food videos, their dance videos, their fashion videos, memes. And we really saw people embracing the genre and wanting to engage with it,"" says Yuvir Pillay, music operations manager at TikTok South Africa.

While Amapiano has recently been on the rise around the world, clubs, car stereos and social media feeds in South Africa have been thrumming with its sound for years.

He says Amapiano is the country's biggest musical genre on TikTok ""We haven't seen a local music genre take over a platform in this kind of huge escalation in a very long time,"" he adds.

Now the sound is spreading beyond borders. In 2021, videos using the hashtag #Amapiano flexed their muscles on the popular app with more than 1.6 billion global views -- while the ""Amapiano Grooves"" playlist on Spotify had more than 50 million streams worldwide.

Uncertain origins

While its popularity is unquestioned, the birth of Amapiano -- which means ""the pianos"" in South Africa's Zulu language -- is often the subject of debate.

The genre's roots are disputed says AshMopedi, host of the Amapiano-dedicated YouTube channel Groove Cartel. ""Perhaps it comes from the Gauteng region [northeastern province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria], where its origins can be traced, but as to who is that one person that created Amapiano, it's a difficult thing,"" he says. ""Whoever it is, please come out and let us know.""

Some argue the infectious sound is rooted in Kwaito, a style of music which blended house beats with hip hop in the 1990s. Music producer, record label owner, and Kwaito pioneer Oscar Sibonginkosi Mdlongwa, known as Oskido, says Kwaito emerged following a period of political change, that saw the release of Nelson Mandela and the decline of apartheid.

""The younger generation at that time, we started creating our own music, which we called Kwaito. We used to take house music, slow it down and from there, we reprogrammed the music,"" he says.

Fast forward two decades and Amapiano emerges. It features the same slowed-down house beats as Kwaito, but also incorporates jazz, synths and percussive basslines.

DJ Vigro Deep, 20, was born in Pretoria, South Africa.

DJs have since played a key role in popularizing the genre. Vigro Deep, a 20 year old Pretoria-born DJ, has taken the Amapiano scene by storm. His keen ear for music has helped catapult him to international success.

""I started producing by the age of 16, (when) Amapiano was something that was trending,"" Vigro Deep says.

He says he takes pride in sharing the sound of the townships with the world -- one that is innovative, collaborative and disruptive in the way it's transforming an industry.

""I think people are now happy that we have our own genre,"" he adds. ""We started something from scratch. It makes us who we are. It's a sound where we can say, 'this is us; this is South Africa, this is Africa.'""

A more inclusive sound

Although Amapiano started out as a genre dominated by male artists, more women are now stepping onto the scene -- from DJ'ing and dancing to singing and even fashion design.

Part of the draw is what dancer Bontle Modiselle describes as an ""inviting"" style.

According to dancer Bontle Modiselle, dance moves like ""legwork,"" the ""pouncing cat,"" and the ""Zekethe"" that are associated with Amapiano are simple and easy.

""When I think about Amapiano, I think about it being the perfect representation of what the Black South African youth today looks like and the fashion, what they feel like, what they sound like in their sounds, how they move in their dance moves,"" she says.

Modiselle has amassed large followings on TikTok and Instagram , where she showcases Amapiano dances that pay homage to the past.

""The visual representation of Amapiano is such that it breeds from a ground of familiarity,"" she says. ""You'll see a lot of Kwaito-esque movements that are reimagined in the look of Amapiano today.""

At the same time, that inviting style makes it accessible. ""It just allows a culture where anyone, from anywhere, of any age can get together and do the same moves and feel like they're a part of the same story,"" she adds.

Yet success for women in Amapiano hasn't come easily.

Mandisa Radebe, who goes by the stage name DBN Gogo , is one of the first female DJs to thrive in the genre. ""(Initially) you didn't see a lot of women DJs in the scene,"" she says, adding that she found herself in the right place at the right time.

Mandisa Radebe, who performs under the stage name DBD Gogo, has been a trailblazer for female Amapiano DJs.

""Now you're seeing a girl trend every single day and seeing this population of women in the industry grow by leaps and bounds,"" she adds.

In 2021, Radebe's hit song ""Khuza Gogo"" reached platinum status for exceeding 2.5 million streams, according to independent music distributors Electromode Ingrooves -- cementing her reputation as a trailblazer for women in the genre.

A genre for the future

Whether Amapiano is here to stay or it evolves into yet another new sound, one thing is certain -- the genre's success has impacted the music industry in South Africa.

""(Amapiano) has changed the way the record business works,"" says Oskido. ""You don't need all these big companies; social media these days has become virtual radio stations.""

Those platforms such as Spotify, YouTube and TikTok -- which saw a boost in users during the pandemic -- also push the supply of music to listeners regardless of where they live. In 2021, Spotify's flagship Amapiano playlist saw a streaming increase of 622% in South Africa alone, while the UK and US ranked second and third respectively with the most streams of that same playlist.

""In 20 years' time, when we all look back at this period in time when we speak about the pandemic, Amapiano is going to be one of those things that comes up in conversation."" says YouTube host AshMopedi. ""I feel that it's one of those genres that just a mainstay, it's not going to go anywhere.""

The genre is a ""lifestyle,"" adds Radebe, and though Amapiano is going global, it's important to remember where it came from.

""It's a culture. It's a saving grace. It is a lifeline,"" she says. ""I think it's really important that we don't change the narrative, twist the narrative of the fact that this is a South African sound -- that this is nurtured, it is built, it is grown here.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/africa/amapiano-south-africa-music-genre-origins-spc-intl/index.html
355,"In Kenya, your next coffee could be a 'camel-ccino'","(CNN) — While tea may be Kenya's largest export , a new beverage is brewing in central Nairobi: cappuccinos made with a splash of camel's milk.

At CJ's Restaurant, a popular café in downtown Nairobi, manager Omar Shariff has noticed a shift. Where demand for camel milk in the past had largely been driven by the local Somali community who grew up with it, today more and more customers are requesting it.

Now, his menu features drinks such as ""camel-ccinos"" and ""camelattes,"" with plans to introduce camel products beyond beverages, such as a camel burger.

Though camel milk is consumed across the world in other regions -- including much of the Middle East, parts of Asia and Australia -- its popularity in East Africa has largely stayed within rural groups. But wider interest both regionally and globally has begun to grow, with prices leading some to dub the milk ""white gold.""

""Camel milk on the international market is incredibly lucrative,"" notes David Hewett, a ranch manager for the Mpala Research Center located on the Laikipia Plateau in north central Kenya. ""Half a liter of finished milk goes for $10 to $20,"" he says, compared to conventional cow's milk which sells for approximately 50 cents per half liter in the US.

Tapping into an abundant source

The African continent is home to 80% of the world's camels, with approximately 60% residing in East Africa alone. In Kenya, more than four million camels roam the country's pastoral lands, a number that has quadrupled since 1999, according to the Kenya Camel Association.

Though a longtime daily staple for some in the region, the beverage lacks an organized and widespread route to market. Instead, the milk is most often found in informal markets around the country.

From yogurt to ""camel-ccinos,"" Kenyan farmers are looking to formalize the sector and bring this superfood to the masses.

Even without a formalized supply chain, the sector contributes 10-12 billion Kenyan shillings ($90-108 million) annually to the country's economy, says Khalif Abey of the Kenya Camel Association.

For one of East Africa's largest camel milk producers, White Gold Camel Milk, the opportunities for growth are apparent. The company produces 500 liters of milk a day, with company CEO Jama Warsame noting local demand has led the company to diversify into other value-added products like flavored camel's milk and yogurt.

The appeal of adaptation

With large parts of eastern Africa continuing to weather longer and more intense bouts of drought, camels have also emerged as a climate-friendly alternative source of food.

According to Kenya's National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), Kenyans living across 23 counties are facing reduced food supplies due to drought and will need food aid within the next six months. Unlike herds of cows and sheep, camels can go 100 miles without water and can maintain their cool in temperatures upwards of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. ""It provides a hedge in the dry weather as the pressure is felt on traditional livestock,"" states Hewett, because ""camels will continue to produce milk.""

Camels are able to continue producing milk even when precious resources like rain are hard to come by. Nick Migwi/CNN

Beyond climate considerations, Shariff says a growing clientele of health-conscious consumers have pushed establishments like CJ's Restaurant to serve the milk.

""We've got several people from gym instructors to health nutritionists saying they've found a lot of interesting facts about the camel milk and it's benefits,"" he says.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says camel milk has triple the amount of vitamin C compared to cow's milk. Ongoing studies have also shown evidence that the milk can reduce cholesterol and improve digestive disorders.

Getting over the hump

While the potential markets for growth exist, a number of challenges continue to hinder camel milk's expansion in Kenya. Limited roads and a lack of infrastructure and cold storage prevent large-scale production and delivery of the dairy.

To expand the sector, the camel milk industry in Kenya is pushing for a more formal value chain. Nick Migwi/CNN

""Where most of the ranchers live, it's a harsh environment. We have to invest in refrigerated trucks. We have to invest in making a center for collection,"" says Warsame.

For a sector built on a network of small family farms, developing the industry to export to profitable markets abroad also presents other hurdles.

""It's very hard to comply with international standards of disease management and control in a multitude of smallholder-produced milk markets,"" notes Hewett.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/kenya-camel-milk-cafes-mpa-spc-intl/index.html
356,Meet the Nigerian board game creator trying to change an industry,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Kenechukwu Cornelius Ogbuagu has been obsessed with playing and building games his entire life.

As a child, he played board and card games including Snakes and Ladders Whot , and Ludo with the kids in his neighborhood in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria, where he was born and raised.

Yet in a country that loves games such as chess and Scrabble -- even fielding a world champion Scrabble team -- Ogbuagu noticed a lack of Nigerian-made games. In 2013, he decided to create his own game while studying at the University of Calabar in southern Nigeria.

""There was a nationwide strike at government-owned universities in the country at the time, so nobody was going to class,"" Ogbuagu, now 29, says. With nothing to do, ""eventually, we started playing tabletop games.""

At the time, he was not sure how to create games, so he used cardboard, stones, and dice from an old Ludo game to make a dice rolling and card drafting game for him and his friends.

Many of Ogbuagu's friends in school enjoyed playing the game, inspiring him to turn his passion into a profession.

Created in 2017, ""Homia"" is a memory and recognition game card game where players race to build their Nigerian home to win.

Creating made-in-Nigeria games

In 2016, a few years after making his first game, Ogbuagu founded a game production publishing company called NIBCARD , which focuses on tabletop games such as board and card games.

""I eventually learned to make games on YouTube,"" he says. ""I learned how to make boards. I learned about direct imaging printers. I also found stores where I could get material to make the games I wanted.""

That same year, he started an annual convention in Abuja, Nigeria's capital city, called the Africa Boardgame Convention , or ""AbCon"" -- a gathering of tabletop game lovers from across the country, which Ogbuagu says is the first of its kind in West Africa.

""Wan wan touch"" is a football-based board game. It was created in 2018.

""Many Nigerians hold stereotypes about board games. They say, 'oh, it is a woman's game.' The convention exists to cancel those types of stereotypes,"" Ogbuagu explains. Roughly 500 people attend the convention every year, he adds.

But his big break came in 2017 when charity organization Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) hired NIBCARD to create 2,300 copies of a game called ""Luku Luku"" for an education project it was running in the country.

Ogbuagu had been working with VSO as a volunteer when the group found out he was into games. ""I met British colleagues who liked to play card games. I became inspired by their games and wanted to make something like that in Nigeria,"" he says.

Since making Luku Luku for VSO, Ogbuagu says NIBCARD has created at least two dozen tabletop games for sale across the country and received grants from organizations including the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).

""With the (IOM) grant, we were supposed to, in an artistic way, create an activity that will create awareness on migration,"" Ogbuagu says. To achieve this, he created a tile-placement game called ""My World Trip.""

""Gbosi,"" debuting in 2018, is a tile placement war game.

""The game has maps of different countries and the names and continent of the countries,"" he explains. ""As players are jumping from country to country trying to win the game, they are forced to learn new countries that they probably have never heard of.""

Nigeria's tabletop gaming industry

According to a report in Dicebreaker , a publication focused on tabletop games, the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown period renewed interest in games and increased the sales of board games in places like the US and UK.

In the same year, tabletop games successfully raised $236.6 million on Kickstarter, accounting for nearly a third of all the money made on the crowd-sourcing platform in 2020.

But in Nigeria, there is hardly any data about the tabletop game industry. While games like chess, Ludo, and Scrabble are popular, the local sector is still largely untapped.

Ogbuagu says one of the reasons the industry is struggling is because there aren't a lot of board and card games designed and produced in the country.

""Many Nigerians don't have access to information about where to get games made in the country. There is also no access to tabletop games cafes and other value chains surrounding these games,"" he explains.

It is difficult for the average Nigerian to find information about games, he adds: ""People will most likely know where to find Scrabble or chess than where to find their local, made-in-Nigeria games.""

A home-grown movement

In 2019, as a way of increasing that awareness, Ogbuagu opened a cafe in Abuja.

""The cafe is just a space filled with games. People can come there to play,"" he says, with 60 Nigerian-made board games and another 300 non-Nigerian games. ""Not all the games there are made by NIBCARD,"" he adds. ""We stock games from other people too.""

""Hut Alive,"" created by Ogbuagu in 2017, is an elimination card game for up to six players.

In the next couple of years, another goal is to get more people to appreciate and access locally made games, which starts with visibility.

He says he is currently in talks with filmmakers from the country, encouraging them to swap games such as chess in their movies for Nigerian games like the ones NIBCARD produces.

He's also trying to reach the next generation of tabletop gamers, with ""volunteers that take our games to different schools across the country,"" Ogbuagu says. ""They teach children to play these games so that as they are growing up, they know that we have our own Nigerian games.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/africa/nigeria-ogbuagu-board-game-creator-spc-intl/index.html

358,Fred Ebami is illustrating modern Africa with his contemporary take on Pop Art,"Written by Nadia Leigh-Hewitson, CNN

For the past decade, Fred Ebami has been blazing a trail for a style he calls ""New Pop"" -- digital Pop Art through an African lens.

The Franco-Cameroonian artist, aged 45, creates hopeful images ranging from the everyday to the iconic -- with particular emphasis on the African continent and global African diaspora. His portraits are a rich blend of iconography, symbolic patterns, slogans, and interpretations of classic Pop Art imagery.

His artworks, created principally on a computer, aim to bring Pop Art into the 21st century, and have been exhibited at the Tate Modern in London, the Champs Élysées in Paris, and Art Basel in Miami. Last November, Ebami opened a retrospective in Lagos, Nigeria, and his work is currently being shown at an exhibition titled ""NEW POP"" in Brest, France.

From drawing on walls

Ebami's life as an artist began at the age of seven, drawing on the walls of his childhood home in Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France. ""I wasn't a very talkative person when I was a kid,"" he said. ""Drawing was my way of talking.""

Ebami wanted to express himself through images, to make the everyday extraordinary with the color and drama he saw in comics, film posters and Pop Art. He first found the work of Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jean-Michel Basquiat as a child and was moved by the excitement and wonder their explosions of color drew from quite ordinary subjects.

""Andy Warhol was the first Pop Artist I came across,"" Ebami said. ""He was taking everyday life, everyday people and making them more beautiful, more interesting.

""When I saw their work, it was just exactly what was going on in my head. But I had to find my own way of doing it,"" he added. ""Those three people, they were like a jump-start button for me.""

Ebami hopes to honor the original Pop Artists using a computer mouse and screen. Aside from a handful of experiments with sculpture and paint, Ebami works digitally -- he sees his computer as an extension of himself. He says working this way allows him to create work whenever inspiration strikes.

Everyday superheroes and African heritage

In May, he is set to release a graphic novel that tells the tragic true story of two teenagers who died of hypothermia whilst stowed away on a plane from Guinea to Brussels in 1999. Found in their possession was a letter making a plea to Europe to help the children of Africa.

While Warhol was famous for his colorful screen prints of rockstars and supermodels, Ebami often takes inspiration from the extraordinary acts of otherwise ordinary people -- he prefers to create striking images of everyday heroes.

""My art is a mix of everyday life and society, and comics -- because I always wanted to represent superheroes,"" said Ebami. ""As I grew up, I realized that superheroes were not like Spiderman and Superman. They're real-life people like nurses, firefighters, soldiers.""

But his work also celebrates African stars, like Cameroonian musicians André-Marie Tala and Manu Dibango, and in place of the simple, pointillist backgrounds made up of dots of color, favored by many mid 20th century Pop Art masters, Ebami uses patterns from textiles connected to his African heritage.

Growing up in France as a child of Cameroonian descent, Ebami noticed that the conversation around Africa in the West was always negative -- after living in Douala, Cameroon, throughout his teenage years and returning to Europe as an adult, he says that little has changed.

""The narrative is that it's only poverty, only war, only bad people, only people getting killed,"" he explained. ""But we've got a new generation that need to show that we're marvelous, need to show that we are super. I want to show you the new side of Africa, and if I can do that with my art, I will do that until I die.""

Pop Art in the digital age

Since the beginning of his professional career, Ebami has been faced with criticism of his form. He says some in Africa struggle to appreciate his digital work as ""real art,"" though attitudes are beginning to change.

Despite continued resistance from the more traditional art circles in Africa, Ebami has shown work across the region, and taught digital art master classes in Cameroon, South Africa, the Ivory Coast and Morocco.

""People in Africa are just realizing how powerful digital can be,"" Ebami said. ""It's tomorrow's language and they have to get into that if they don't want to be left behind.""

""My aim is not to be the only one,"" he added. ""My aim is to inspire the new generation and show them another way of communicating. To show another way of being connected to the world.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fred-ebami-pop-art-africa-spc-intl/index.html
359,Amazon's going to Nollywood -- and its deals with studios could shake up one of the world's most prolific filmmaking hubs,"(CNN) In its hunt for content, Amazon Prime Video has turned to Nigeria, where it has secured key deals with studios that could shake up business in Africa's most prolific filmmaking hub.

In recent months, the US giant has signed exclusive streaming agreements with Inkblot Productions and Anthill Studios -- which say the deals will fundamentally change the way they operate.

Chinaza Onuzo, co-founder of Inkblot Productions, the studio behind domestic hits ""The Wedding Party"" and ""Up North,"" told CNN Business the company has signed a three-year licensing deal running through to 2024. The deal will see Inkblot's upcoming releases move onto Amazon's platform after showing in cinemas.

""This allows us to plan long-term,"" Onuzo says. Instead of film-by-film commissioning, the company is looking at possible intellectual property deals and franchise potential in Inkblot's existing titles. ""It has given us the opportunity to broaden the genres that we explore (and) given us the opportunity to work with a with a wider mix of filmmakers and talents,"" he adds.

Anthill Studios produces original features and animation, releasing titles including ""Prophetess"" and ""Day of Destiny"" (the latter a co-production with Inkblot). Its films will also appear on Prime Video after a theatrical window, in a multi-year agreement.

360,Opibus: The mobility startup converting Kenya to electric vehicles,"(CNN) A university research project that turns into a startup, which within a few short years partners with Uber and attracts millions of dollars of investment from around the world, including Silicon Valley.

It's the stuff of entrepreneurial dreams, and yet that's what's happened to Opibus, a Swedish-Kenyan electric mobility company.

Based in Nairobi, Opibus gives new life to old vehicles by converting them to run on electric motors. Beginning with 4x4s, the company's reach has since expanded into public transport with bus conversions. Meanwhile, its electric motorbikes, designed and manufactured in Kenya, have attracted the attention of the world's most famous ride-hailing app.

Opibus has roots as research by Linköping University students Filip Gardler, Mikael Gånge and Filip Lövström, whose project involved identifying places where electric mobility could have the largest possible impact. They pinpointed Kenya and established Opibus in 2017, starting their business by converting safari touring vehicles.

""We've always known the commercial potential (of electric conversion),"" CEO Lövström says, adding it was easy to convince safari tour operators of the benefits of silent 4x4s that are driven on circular routes and return to the same recharging point.

Since then, Opibus has converted 4x4s for use in mining and other utility roles. The process is not cheap: prices start at just under $40,000 to convert a Toyota Land Cruiser and Land Rover, a 10-to-14-day process involving parts sourced from all over the world, says Lövström. But, he argues, the benefits outweigh the expense, and that much of the cost -- along with the carbon footprint of the conversion -- are recouped in the running of the electric vehicle (EV).

Opibus say it has motorcycle pilots underway in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.

Why Kenya is primed for electric vehicles

Fransua Vytautas Razvadauskas, mobility and cities senior consultant at market research company Euromonitor International, cites high prices as a barrier to entry, but so too infrastructure. ""For the EV rollout to be successful (in Kenya), a large supply of charging units -- both public and private -- are needed to prevent range anxiety. This will, in turn, demand large investments in the upgrade of electricity distribution units, at homes and businesses,"" he explains.

Using electric vehicles for public transport overcomes range anxiety and charging infrastructure issues to a degree. A bus operator knows how many miles it will travel in a day, what route and where it will stop, and charging units can be planned accordingly.

Opibus began a pilot for its 51-seater electric bus in January. The company installed off-grid solar powered charging points to top up the bus' batteries.

In January, Opibus began an electric bus pilot in Nairobi, installing off-grid solar power stations to charge its batteries (the company sells a range of off-grid solar modules and batteries -- a clean energy source but also indicative of Kenya's history of blackouts ). The 51-passenger vehicle hasn't been tested commercially yet, but the company plans to do so later this year.

Lövström believes that with a fast-growing population in sub-Saharan Africa and rapidly expanding cities, buses will be a vital part of the region's infrastructure. ""We really think that electric buses are a huge part of how to create this transition to electric vehicles, and how to reduce emissions on both a city and global level,"" he says.

Opibus plans to manufacture the bus for a Pan-African market in 2023. It also has competition. Another Kenya-based startup, BasiGo , has announced it plans to start its own electric bus pilot program in March.

A revolution on two wheels?

Opibus' motorcycle has a range of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and a top speed of 90 kilometers per hour (56 miles per hour).

Razvadauskas identifies the ""largest opportunity"" for EVs in East Africa as two- and three-wheeled vehicles, because they are cheaper and more popular than cars.

""In 2021, Kenya was home to 1.8 million motorcycles and mopeds compared with 1.2 million passenger cars -- a tendency that is analogous in other regional countries such as Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda,"" Razvadauskas says.

Opibus is looking to corner the market through its Kenya-made electric motorbike.

The company decided to design its model from scratch because no existing motorcycles matched local users' needs, says Lövström. ""We need something that is very strong, very versatile, very robust, easy to repair and cheap at the same time,"" he explains.

""Almost 90% of the motorcycles are built and designed locally,"" says Lucy Mugala, a research and development engineer who helped create the motorbike. ""(Electric vehicle manufacturing) is quite new in this county, so we are sort of pioneers.""

She says the motorcycle has evolved from having a single onboard battery to two removable batteries, which use a portable charger that can plug into any socket. In the near future, Mugala says docking stations packed with charged batteries could be a feature in cities, like today's petrol stations.

The bike comes with a detachable battery (either single or dual) meaning fully-charged batteries can be swapped in in a matter of minutes.

Prices start at $1,400 for the motorcycle, which has a range of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and a top speed of 90 kilometers per hour (56 miles per hour). It enters a competitive market dominated by petrol motorcycles from Indian and Chinese manufacturers including Bajaj Auto and Haojun. Lövström concedes that Opibus' electric motorcycle is currently ""a few hundred dollars more"" than conventional motorcycles.

In December, Opibus announced a strategic partnership with Uber as part of the ride-hailing company's aim to be fully electric by 2040. Opibus will supply 3,000 motorcycles this year and is working with a financing partner for Uber drivers to own the electric motorcycles for commercial use.

The company has sold 150 units to date and plans to produce 12,000 motorcycles in 2023. Outside Kenya, Opibus has motorcycle trials with different partners in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.

""Expanding to other markets is definitely going to be a plus for us,"" Mugala says, ""but more so (is) bringing the cost of our electric motorbikes down as low as possible.""

Plans for expansion

The Swedish-Kenyan company received a $7.5 million round of investment in November 2021. CEO and co-founder Filip Lövström told CNN investment has come from all over the world, including Silicon Valley and the African continent.

Opibus received significant backing in the form of a $7.5 million round of investment in November 2021.

""This has really accelerated our mission to scale up production,"" Mugala says, with the company intending to expand its 100-strong staff and its manufacturing space to meet its growing output.

Opibus has ambitions to establish regional hubs, but Kenya will continue as its base of operation -- a country where senior staff from Sweden have been living for around five years already.

""We always knew that there were massive opportunities,"" says Lövström. ""That is very hard to understand when you're not there. You need to be on the ground.""

""(Globally, there are) 150 to 200 million new vehicle sales per year, but we have 1.2 billion vehicles in the world already,"" he says of the opportunity electric retrofitting represents. ""We need to do something if we are to reach our targets of having green electric fleets across the world.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/africa/opibus-kenya-electric-mobility-bus-motorcycle-car-spc-intl/index.html
361,Nigeria is oil rich and energy poor. It can't wait around for cheaper batteries,"Africa's biggest economy has 206 million people, endemic poverty and vast energy reserves that could be harnessed to fuel development. But it's coming under huge pressure from developed countries to abandon fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy in order to help save the climate

At the same time, many poor countries that have so far contributed very little to global CO2 emissions are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and increased droughts, fires and floods linked to climate change, which threaten food security and exacerbate water scarcity.

Nigeria's largest city Lagos, for example, may become uninhabitable by the end of this century if sea levels continue rising, according to scientific projections. It is already grappling with an eroding coastline that makes the city vulnerable to flooding.

Yet the average person in Nigeria emits less than 0.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the World Bank. That compares with the European Union's 6.4 metric tons per capita and North America's 15.3 metric tons.

""The biggest justice issue is that the countries that are the least developed are also the most vulnerable and have the least ability to adapt to climate impacts,"" said Amal-Lee Amin, climate change director at CDC Group, Britain's development finance institution.

If poor countries are asked to give up fossil fuel production, experts say their wealthy counterparts need to spend trillions of dollars to develop solutions that both spur economic development and protect the planet. If that doesn't happen, the global poor may be left behind in the energy transition.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2060 on Tuesday, joining other large energy exporters including Saudi Arabia. But he also told COP26 attendees that Nigeria needs ""adequate and sustained technical and financial support"" to meet its goal.

Lagos on May 13 2020, shortly after the government eased coronavirus lockdown measures.

Untapped resources

Millions of Nigerians don't have access to electricity. But the country's government and economy depend on energy.

Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer, with fossil fuels accounting for 60% of government revenue and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The Petroleum Industry Act, which Buhari signed into law in August, envisions an even greater role for oil and gas in Nigeria's economy.

""The intent [of the Act] is to really transform the industry for us to be able to attract the required investment into oil and gas,"" explained Adewale Ajayi, a partner at KPMG in Lagos. That entails ramping up oil production to 4 million barrels per day, from 1.6 million barrels currently, and drawing on the country's roughly 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves to provide much needed electricity.

""We have enormous reserves of gas in Nigeria and we need to be able to tap into those resources to develop the Nigerian economy,"" Ajayi told CNN Business, adding that alongside power generation, gas will also be crucial to developing industries such as petrochemicals and fertilizers.

The law also lays the groundwork for developing oil refining capacity, which would allow Nigeria to stop importing virtually all of its fuel at an enormous cost.

Change can't come quickly enough in a country where some 90 million people, or more than 40% of the population, don't have access to electricity and more than 80 million live on less than $1 a day.

""Nigeria will soon, certainly before 2050, have a larger population than the United States, but it has less than 1% of America's electricity generation capacity,"" said Todd Moss, executive director of the Energy for Growth Hub , a nonprofit focused on energy for development based in Washington D.C.

Nigeria's installed power generation capacity is about 13 gigawatts, but only about 4 or 5 gigawatts reaches end users due to breakdowns in transmission and distribution. By comparison, the United States has over 1,000 gigawatts of utliity-scale electricity generating capacity.

""Nigeria just needs a lot more energy,"" added Moss.

Can't afford to wait

Nigeria's energy ambitions are coming up against a global drive by banks, pension funds and development finance institutions to limit or altogether halt investments into fossil fuels in line with net-zero emissions goals.

""They're prioritizing global emissions over Africa's development needs,"" said Moss.

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, natural gas projects are ""increasingly imperiled by a lack of development finance,"" according to Nigeria's Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.

""Efforts to restrict fossil fuel investments in Africa are even harder to stomach because many of the wealthy countries behind them — including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States — include natural gas in their own multidecade plans to transition to clean energy,"" Osinbajo wrote recently in Foreign Affairs

The European Investment Bank will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of this year, with some exceptions for gas-fired power plants, while the World Bank, the biggest provider of climate finance to developing countries, is moving towards restricting its fossil fuel investments, according to Reuters

CDC Group will no longer invest in most parts of the coal, oil and gas industries, according to its recent fossil fuel policy . CDC will consider investments into gas power where there are ""large unmet energy needs"" and if these are consistent with a pathway to net zero, according to Amin.

Moves by such institutions to restrict fossil fuel funding come despite the fact that the United Kingdom relies on gas for around two thirds of its electricity, while the European Union currently has €87 billion ($102 billion) worth of gas projects in the pipeline, according to a report by the Global Energy Monitor.

In the United States, natural gas makes up 40% of utility-scale electricity generation, with coal, nuclear and renewables contributing about 20% each, according to the US Energy Information Administration

Solar panels on the rooftop of a street boutique in Lagos, Nigeria.

Like the United States, Europe and Britain, Nigeria sees a prominent role for renewable energy, notwithstanding its investments into gas power.

The government is targeting 32 gigawatts of on-grid power generation capacity by 2030, with renewables expected to contribute 43% and gas making up 41%. When off-grid capacity is included, gas and renewables will contribute roughly 30% each to planned power generation capacity of 45 gigawatts.

""In Nigeria, clean energy is central to our government's plan to transition to net-zero emissions,"" Osinbajo, the vice president, continued. ""But our citizens cannot be forced to wait for battery prices to fall or new technologies to be created in order to have reliable energy and live modern, dignified lives.""

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to three quarters of the 760 million people globally without access to electricity, according to the World Bank, which expects that number to rise as a result of the pandemic. Less than half of the population has access to electricity in their homes.

In Nigeria, energy poverty is itself a major driver of emissions, according to Olu Verheijen, the founder of Lagos-based energy advisory business Latimer Energy. Given how scarce and unreliable existing supply is, many households and businesses rely on diesel generators for backup energy supply, while the lack of access to modern cooking technologies is a major driver of deforestation.

""If you're siting on massive reserves of gas that have already been commercialized, it makes sense to extend that existing infrastructure to satisfy energy needs, diversify the economy and lift citizens out of poverty,"" Verheijen said.

Africa's renewables potential

The Nigerian government's Solar Power Naija initiative — which aims to deploy 5 million new solar-based connections by 2023 — highlights how difficult it is to scale renewable solutions quickly.

The program will expand energy access to 25 million individuals, delivering power to just 28% of Nigerians who don't currently have access. And while a step in the right direction, solar panels on roofs are not necessarily adequate to power large industrial businesses, which require a great deal more electricity than what's needed to switch on a light bulb or charge a cellphone.

Still, renewable technology is developing at lightning speed and this can only benefit Africa.

Mark Carrato, who coordinates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Power Africa program, sees vast potential to deliver electricity to Africa in a climate smart way.

Since its launch in 2013, Power Africa has delivered electricity to over 118 million people on the continent, connecting 25 million homes and businesses to on and off-grid energy solutions. More than three quarters of the transactions it has closed are based on renewable technologies.

""In almost every case, project by project you see a renewables solution that is cheaper,"" he told CNN Business.

Carrato argues that fossil fuels might provide short-term solutions to energy needs, but could end up taxing poorer countries in the long run through increased funding costs and the problem of ""stranded assets,"" in which infrastructure becomes obsolete as it is replaced by cleaner and cheaper renewable technologies.

""The cost of capital to do fossil fuels is only going to increase,"" Carrato said.

On the other hand, the cost of renewable technologies is rapidly declining. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the cost of large, utility-scale solar projects decreased 82% between 2010 and 2019, while the cost of onshore wind fell by 40%.

The cost of electricity storage technologies — which will be crucial to facilitating ""deep decarbonization"" including in sectors such as transport and construction — are also expected to fall considerably by 2030.

Africa is well positioned to benefit. The continent's estimated potential to generate renewable energy from existing technologies is 1,000 times larger than its projected demand for electricity in 2040, according to IRENA.

""Renewable energy — including green hydrogen — could replace African exports of coal, oil and gas,"" it said in a recent report with German development banks KfW and GIZ.

But to leverage the potential for renewables, average annual investments in Africa's energy system must double by 2030 to approximately $65 billion.

While there's good reason to be bullish on Africa's potential to leapfrog fossil fuel technologies in favor of cleaner energy sources, the kind of renewable technology that can rapidly drive industrial development — to power factories, fuel transport and logistics networks and enable the digital economy to thrive — is not yet commercially available at scale.

In the meantime, some analysts argue that Africa needs reliable and affordable energy. ""It's absolutely untenable to hold the position that African countries and African people should wait until [battery] storage costs come down. That seems immoral and kind of outrageous,"" said Moss of the Energy for Growth Hub.

The under-construction Dangote Industries oil refinery and fertilizer plant site outside of Lagos, Nigeria.

Existing electricity grids in Africa are also fundamentally different to more advanced developed markets, which can absorb significant intermittent power. This means that in some cases, certainly for Nigeria, gas has an important role to play in providing power.

""Off-grid solar is fine but it's not enough for industry, for big cities and it's definitely not going to drive the job creation that Nigeria also needs,"" added Moss.

""When we talk about energy poverty in Africa we're talking about getting poor people a lightbulb in their house,"" he continued. ""That is the first step on the energy ladder, that is not modern energy. Energy for growth is energy needed in the wider economy used outside the home that can drive higher incomes but especially job creation.""

A just transition

To put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century, the International Energy Agency estimates that annual clean energy investment into emerging and developing economies needs to increase more than sevenfold to $1 trillion annually by 2030.

As it stands, these economies currently account for just one fifth of global investment into clean energy and pay interest rates to borrow money that are up to seven times higher than in the United States or Europe.

Developed countries also remained $20 billion short of meeting a pledge to channel $100 billion per year by 2020 towards helping poor countries tackle climate change.

""In many emerging and developing economies, emissions are heading upwards while clean energy investments are faltering, creating a dangerous fault line in global efforts to reach climate and sustainable energy goals,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a recent report.

""Countries are not starting on this journey from the same place — many do not have access to the funds they need to rapidly transition to a healthier and more prosperous energy future, and the damaging effects of the Covid-19 crisis are lasting longer in many parts of the developing world,"" he added.

In the race to solve the climate crisis, there's a clear risk that the development needs of poor countries are sacrificed in pursuit of global emissions goals.

362,Meet the Nigerian visual artist turning coffee into fine art,"Aisha Salaudeen , CNN Written by

In a coffee shop in Lagos, Nigeria, visual artist Ekene Ngige was meeting with some colleagues when he had an accidental eureka moment that would change the course of his career.

Ngige knocked over his cappuccino, making a mess on the notepad in front of him. He quickly noticed that the beverage created random patterns on paper, and thought: what if he used coffee to create art?

""It was supposed to be a mistake, but I loved the mistake -- and I didn't want to wipe it off,"" Ngige said. ""I loved the color. I loved the texture.""

Back in the studio, Ngige began mixing instant coffee with water, creating a jelly-like paste that allowed him to paint with it -- sketching with a pencil first and then layering it with different shades of instant or ground coffee mixtures, and sometimes incorporating whole beans.

Seven years after that first spill, he continues painting realistic portraits of people and objects.

Finding inspiration

The 39-year-old has been interested in the arts since he was a child, going on to study fine arts at Yaba College of Technology in Lagos, where he specialized in creating paintings with watercolor, acrylic, and oil paints.

On average, Ngige says it takes him about two weeks to a month to finish a coffee portrait. ""My paintings are inspired by things that happen around me, events that happen around my society, the world at large,"" he said, and it can depend on ""what the event is at that moment, (or) sometimes being inspired by my emotions.""

Through some of his work, the artist shares a message of peace, encouraging people to forget their differences and embrace serenity. One of his portrait collections, called ""Peace Makers,"" features notable figures such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and former South African president Nelson Mandela.

""The world at large has been suffering from terrorism, racism and tribalism,"" Ngige said. ""I've been painting pictures that will reach people and touch their hearts.""

The artist, who is also the creative director at an animation company called X-Animators , hopes to showcase his coffee portraits in galleries beyond Nigeria.

""The best part of creating art is being able to reach the whole world,"" he said. ""I have had calls and messages from all around the world, from people that have been touched by the topics of the paintings I make. It warms my heart -- it makes me feel like I am fulfilling a purpose.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ekene-ngige-nigeria-coffee-art-spc-intl/index.html

Dior hosted a fashion show in South Korea for the very first time on Saturday, presenting its latest collection to a star-studded audience in Seoul.

The French fashion giant transformed the prestigious Ewha Womans University into a runway, sending skateboarders down a sloping central ramp before models appeared in waves of yellow plaid, sheer tulle and pleated outerwear. The brand is also partnering with the university as part of its Women@Dior mentorship and education program.

Overseen by Dior's creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri , the label's Fall 2022 womenwear collection put a contemporary spin on uniforms. Looks were often completed with blouses and neckties, while short skirts and biker shorts contributed to what the brand described in a press release as ""punk overtones.""

Among the celebrities in attendance was Blackpink singer Jisoo, who has been a global ambassador for Dior since last year. The K-pop star was joined at the event by various other stars, including figure skater Kim Yuna and Korean American rapper Jay Park.

The show signals South Korea's increasing importance to the French fashion house, which described the weekend's event as ""unprecedented."" In a statement prior to the show, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, Pietro Beccari, said that the label is ""forging new powerful ties"" with the country.

Dior's website lists almost 25 boutiques across South Korea, including seven in Seoul's exclusive Gangnam district. Its flagship store, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc, opened in the capital in 2015.

On Sunday, shortly after the show, the label opened a sizable new concept store in the capital's trendy Seongsu-dong neighborhood. Inspired by the brand's Paris headquarters, the sprawling open-air boutique features a garden and lounge, with furniture by various Korean designers.

Luxury powerhouse

Dior is not the first European fashion house to stage events in South Korea as other Asian destinations -- China, most notably -- prove difficult to operate in amid Covid-19 restrictions. Louis Vuitton, for instance, presented its men's fall-winter 2021 collection at an art space outside Seoul. One of the last shows overseen by the label's late creative director Virgil Abloh, it featured K-pop mega-band BTS, which had signed as Louis Vuitton ambassadors earlier in the year.

Several other labels have looked to appoint South Korean stars as brand ambassadors, with Gucci, Loewe, Givenchy, Chanel, Prada and Alexander McQueen among those to sign up K-pop singers, movie stars or both in recent years.

Jisoo's Blackpink bandmates have all partnered with major luxury brands, with Rosé the face of Saint Laurent and Tiffany & Co., Lisa representing Celine and Bulgari and Jennie working with Chanel and Calvin Klein. Louis Vuitton's womenswear division is meanwhile working with ""Squid Game"" star Ho-yeon Jung.

While many Asian markets are still recovering from the impact of the pandemic, luxury spending in South Korea has bounced back to 2019 levels, according to consulting firm Bain & Company. The firm's 2021 Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study noted that Korean shoppers choosing to buy at home rather than overseas has ""more than compensated for the lack of tourism"" in the country.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/dior-fall-2022-south-korea-show/index.html
364,Japanese man invents 'edible' plastic bag alternative to save Nara's sacred deer,"(CNN) — A local entrepreneur in the Japanese tourist destination of Nara has developed an alternative to plastic shopping bags, to protect the town's sacred deer

Hidetoshi Matsukawa, who works for Nara-ism, a souvenir wholesale agent, told CNN he heard last year that the deer, which roam the city's park, were dying after ingesting plastic bags.

""I wanted to do something to protect the deer, which is the symbol of Nara,"" he said.

The city is home to around 1,000 sacred deer, which are officially designated as a national natural treasure in Japan , and many tourists feed them treats.

In July 2019, however, a local welfare group said nine deer had been found dead, with plastic bags in their stomachs, and called on visitors not to throw away plastic bags in the park.

Matsukawa wanted to come up with a different solution to the problem, and teamed up with a local paper manufacturer and a design firm to work on the project.

These plastic bags were pulled from the stomach of a dead deer. Courtesy Bunyodo

Between them they developed ""Shikagami,"" or deer paper, which is made from rice bran and milk cartons.

""We learned rice bran are mostly wasted in the process of rice polishing,"" said Matsukawa. ""So this paper helps to reduce that waste as well.""

Matsukawa has had the bags tested and says they are safe for human consumption.

""We do not have the data to back up that this paper is not harmful to deers, but I believe this is safe for them as well as for human beings,"" he said, laughing.

The bags have since been tested at local banks and the Todaiji temple, Nara's main tourist attraction. The temple and banks bought 4,000-5,000 of the bags for 100 yen (around 95 cents) each as part of the pilot project.

365,"Sri Lanka's leopards are under threat, but this woman is determined to save them","(CNN) Having endured a bloody civil war from 1983 until 2009, Sri Lanka is now at peace and developing rapidly. That's good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation's leopards are under threat.

Sri Lankan conservationist Anjali Watson says that as forests where leopards live are cleared to plant crops and build homes, the big cats are being squeezed into pockets of wilderness that don't connect with each other.

""We've lost a lot of leopards,"" says Watson. Nobody knows how many prowled the land before the war, but about 70% of the animals' habitat has been destroyed, and only 750 to 1,000 adult leopards remain, she says.

What's more, leopards are at risk of getting caught in snares. The wire traps are usually set for bushmeat species, including wild boar and deer, but they are indiscriminate in what they catch.

366,Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima,"(CNN) Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination.

On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes.

Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area.

A Japanese serow explores the area.

Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.

Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.

367,China debuts train prototype that can hit speeds of 620 kilometers per hour,"(CNN) — China has revealed a prototype for a new high-speed Maglev train that is capable of reaching speeds of 620 kilometers (385 miles) per hour.

The train runs on high-temperature superconducting (HTS) power that makes it look as if the train is floating along the magnetized tracks.

The sleek 21-meter-long (69 feet) prototype was unveiled to media in the city of Chengdu, Sichuan Province, on January 13. In addition, university researchers constructed 165 meters (541 feet) of track to demonstrate how the train would look and feel in transit, according to state-run Xinhua News

Professor He Chuan (vice president of Southwest Jiaotong University, which worked on the prototype) told reporters that the train could be ""operational"" within 3-10 years.

He added: ""Sichuan has rich rare earth resources, which is very beneficial to our construction of permanent magnet tracks, thus promoting the faster development of experiments.""

China is home to the world's largest high-speed rail network, which stretches over 37,000 kilometers, and the fastest commercially operating train -- the Shanghai maglev.

The country's first high-speed Maglev train, it began operating in 2003. Running at a top speed of 431 kph, the train links Shanghai Pudong Airport and Longyang Road in the eastern side of Shanghai.



China has been eager to make further infrastructure improvements ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will take place in Beijing.

This time last year, China unveiled a new 174-kilometer high-speed railway line connecting Beijing with 2022 Winter Olympics host city Zhangjiakou, cutting the travel time between the two from three hours to 47 minutes.

Earlier this month, the country debuted a bullet train specifically designed to withstand freezing temperatures .

368,A 5-story building in Shanghai 'walks' to a new location,"Shanghai residents passing through the city's eastern Huangpu district in October might have stumbled upon an unusual sight: a ""walking"" building.

An 85-year-old primary school has been lifted off the ground -- in its entirety -- and relocated using new technology dubbed the ""walking machine.""

In the city's latest effort to preserve historic structures, engineers attached nearly 200 mobile supports under the five-story building, according to Lan Wuji, chief technical supervisor of the project.

The supports act like robotic legs. They're split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan, whose company Shanghai Evolution Shift developed the new technology in 2018.

""It's like giving the building crutches so it can stand up and then walk,"" he said.

A timelapse shot by the company shows the school inching laboriously along, one tiny step at a time.

According to a statement from the Huangpu district government, the Lagena Primary School was constructed in 1935 by the municipal board of Shanghai's former French Concession. It was moved in order to make space for a new commercial and office complex, which will be completed by 2023.

Workers had to first dig around the building to install the 198 mobile supports in the spaces underneath, Lan explained. After the pillars of the building were truncated, the robotic ""legs"" were then extended upward, lifting the building before moving forward.

Over the course of 18 days, the building was rotated 21 degrees and moved 62 meters (203 feet) away to its new location. The relocation was completed on October 15, with the old school building set to become a center for heritage protection and cultural education.

The project marks the first time this ""walking machine"" method has been used in Shanghai to relocate a historical building, the government statement said.

Decades of destruction

In recent decades, China's rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings razed to clear land for gleaming skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of demolition across the country.

Some cities have launched new preservation and conservation campaigns including, on occasion, the use of advanced technologies that allow old buildings to be relocated rather than demolished.

Official indifference toward historic architecture can be traced back to the rule of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong. During the disastrous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, innumerable historic buildings and monuments were destroyed as part of his war on the ""Four Olds"" (old customs, culture, habits and ideas).

Mao's death in 1976 saw calls for architectural conservation reemerge, with China's government granting protected status to a number of structures before passing a heritage preservation law in the 1980s. In the years that followed, buildings, neighborhoods and even entire towns were given state support to maintain their historic appearances.

Nonetheless, relentless urbanization has continued to pose a significant threat to architectural heritage. The sale of land is also a key source of revenue for local governments, meaning that buildings with architectural value are often sold off to property developers for whom conservation is not a priority.

In the capital Beijing, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of its historic alleys and traditional courtyard homes were destroyed between 1990 and 2010, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.

In the early 2000s, cities including Nanjing and Beijing -- prompted by critics protesting the loss of old neighborhoods -- drew up long-term plans to preserve what was left of their historic sites, with protections introduced to safeguard buildings and restrict developers.

These conservation efforts have taken different forms. In Beijing, a near-ruined temple was transformed into a restaurant and gallery, while in Nanjing, a cinema from the 1930s was restored to resemble its original form, with some additions outfitting it for modern use. In 2019, Shanghai welcomed Tank Shanghai, an arts center built in renovated oil tanks.

""Relocation is not the first choice, but better than demolition,"" said Lan, the Shanghai primary school's project supervisor. ""I'd rather not touch the historical buildings at all.""

He added that to relocate a monument, companies and developers have to go through strict regulations, such as getting approval from government at various levels.

Building relocations he said however, are ""a viable option."" ""The central government is putting more emphasis on the protection of historical buildings. I'm happy to see that progress in recent years.""

Moving monuments

Shanghai has arguably been China's most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century ""shikumen"" (or ""stone gate"") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life, despite some criticism about how the redevelopments were carried out.

The city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2003, the Shanghai Concert Hall, built in 1930, was moved over 66 metes (217 feet) to make way for an elevated highway. The Zhengguanghe Building -- a six-story warehouse, also from the 1930s -- was then shifted 125 feet (38 meters) as part of a local redevelopment in 2013.

There are a few ways to go about moving a building: It can slide down a set of rails, or be pulled along by vehicles, for instance.

But the Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7,600 tons, posed a new challenge -- it's T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua . The irregular shape meant that traditional methods of pulling or sliding may not have worked because it may not have withstood the lateral forces placed on it, said Lan.

The building also needed to be rotated and follow a curved route to its relocation instead of just moving in a straight line -- another challenge that required a new method.

""During my 23 years of working in this area, I haven't seen any other company that can move structures in a curve,"" he added.

Experts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the ""walking machine,"" Xinhua said.

Lan told CNN he couldn't share the exact cost of the project, and that relocation costs will differ case by case.

""It can't be used as a reference, because we have to preserve the historical building no matter what,"" he said. ""But in general, it's cheaper than demolishing and then rebuilding something in a new location.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/shanghai-relocate-building-preservation-intl-hnk-scli/index.html
369,Self-driving robotaxis are taking off in China,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years . In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.

On Thursday, AutoX, an-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.

Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside.

This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.

The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin.

It also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.

""It's a dream,"" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. ""After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.""

Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. ""We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,"" he said. ""The AI software is better [now.]""

""From a technical point of view, the car is ready,"" Xiao said. ""It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.""

AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called ""Professor X."" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.

The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.

Race of the robotaxi

While AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.

In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)

Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.

In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.

Baidu BIDU Recently, Chinese tech giantalso announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.

AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.

In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app.

The startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.

Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.

""The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,"" he added. ""For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.""

China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.

The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.

""The bar is incredibly high,"" he said. ""It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/tech/autox-robotaxi-china-intl-hnk/index.html
370,Travel to Japan during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,"Editor's Note — Coronavirus cases remain high across the globe. Health officials caution that travel increases your chances of getting and spreading the virus. Staying home is the best way to stem transmission. Below is information on what to know if you still plan to travel, last updated on April 7.

(CNN) — If you're planning to travel to Japan, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The basics

Japan was initially lauded for containing the virus during the first wave but has since seen several surges in cases.

As of April 8, Japan is no longer denying entry to residents of 106 nations, which include Canada, Chile, Fiji, France, Germany, Israel, Morocco, the Philippines and the United States. A full list of countries can be found here

About 50 countries still remain on the ""subject to denial"" list, including Russia and South Africa.

One note of caution, though: these rules still do not apply to leisure travelers. They will primarily affect business travelers and foreign students.

The Japanese government has confirmed that it will raise the quota of foreigners allowed to enter the country from 7,000 to 10,000 per day sometime in April.

What's on offer

A heady mix of the cutting edge and deeply traditional, Japan remains a major draw for travelers from all over the globe. Whether participating in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, scouring Tokyo's Akihabara district for tech bargains or soaking in a hot onsen in the forests of Tohoku, this is a country that leaves its mark on all who visit.

Who can go

Japan has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the world, although there are small signs of hope it will reopen to international tourism in the coming months.

As of March 22, there are no prefectures under the ""state of emergency"" or ""quasi-state of emergency"" designation.

Consult MOFA for the latest information.

What are the restrictions?

Those traveling under Japan's revised business travel rules will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, signed and stamped by the laboratory where it was taken. While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport.

Under these states and quasi-states, prefecture governments were allowed to make restrictions about things like crowd sizes and restaurant hours. With those designations lifted, it is possible for venues like bars, malls and cinemas to reopen.

What's the Covid situation?

As of April 7, Japan had reported 6,830,997 confirmed cases of the virus and 28,462 deaths.

Japan confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant on December 22, 2021. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed that the infected patient was a Japanese man in his 30s returning from Namibia.

Japan's health ministry has announced that it will allow prefectures to let younger patients who are considered lower risk to self-administer antigen tests and start isolating at home without waiting for a doctor's diagnosis.

Previously, patients had to be registered as a Covid-19 patient by a doctor, who reported each new case to the government. If adopted, the new policy will allow patients to contact local public health centers themselves.

This measure is intended to reduce the number of people visiting hospitals and health centers.

Japan is considering following in the footsteps of Israel and encouraging older residents to get a fourth vaccine shot. The government health ministry has ordered more shots from Moderna and Pfizer in order to roll out this plan, but there is no date for the program yet.

What can visitors expect?

While much of Japan remains open for business, cities are far quieter than usual and the government has the right to request the closure of businesses in areas of high transmission. Masks must be worn in public.

371,Sri Lanka reopens borders to international travelers,"(CNN) — The island nation of Sri Lanka is now open to tourists from all countries.

Sri Lanka Minister of Tourism Prasanna Ranatunga made the official announcement during a press conference on Thursday, confirming they would reopen the country's borders from January 21. Both of the country's international airports reopened on the same day.

""The livelihood of around 3 million people depends on tourism in Sri Lanka,"" Ranatunga told media. ""It is our national responsibility to take into consideration the needs of our citizens that depend on this industry.""

As part of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Sri Lanka created a ""bio bubble,"" which will give visitors a relative amount of freedom to travel within the country while still observing safety protocols.

Though there is no minimum time that a visitor must spend in the country, anyone coming from abroad must stay in a government-approved hotel or resort for up to two weeks upon arrival.

That means that travelers only coming for a short trip will just stay in their resort the entire time, while people who are planning longer stays will be able to move more freely within Sri Lanka once they complete their two-weeks of semi-quarantine.

Unlike places like Hong Kong and Australia, where people quarantining upon arrival must stay in their hotel rooms for the entire duration, Sri Lanka's regulations are a bit laxer. Guests will have free rein on-property, so they can use facilities like pools, gyms, salons and restaurants.

Travelers can also leave the hotel during quarantine to go sightseeing, provided they do so carefully. About a dozen tourism sites and attractions are open to foreign visitors, but with caveats.

The five-star Anantara Peace Haven in Tangalle is on the list of approved hotels. Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle

For instance, as part of the ""bio bubble,"" attractions like Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) and the Royal Botanic Gardens, both in the central city of Kandy, require visitors to come as part of an organized tour group or with an approved Sri Lankan guide.

They must travel in a private vehicle and not make any unauthorized side stops. Some sites will only allow tourists during designated time slots or on certain days of the week.

Currently, 55 hotels and resorts fall under the ""safe and secure level one"" guidelines. They are not allowed to accept any local guests or host any events while they're part of the bio bubble.

With extra security comes extra fees.

In addition to paying for flights and accommodation, travelers are responsible for the cost of Sri Lanka's government-sanctioned health insurance ($12 US) and up to three Covid tests in-country ($40 each).

Everyone coming into the country must show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 96 hours of travel and fill out an online health declaration form. Guests will be tested again at their own expense on the fifth and seventh days after arriving and people staying longer than seven days will have to take a third test the following week.

Once the two weeks are up and they have a negative coronavirus test, travelers can stay at their hotel or switch to another one of the approved hotels. Airbnbs, guest houses and other forms of accommodation are off limits. Taking public transit is discouraged.

All prospective travelers must apply for a visa online and download the Visit Sri Lanka app. The app will be used for contact tracing as well as storing information about test results and hotel bookings.

372,Singapore Airlines hopes to be world's first fully-vaccinated airline,"(CNN) — Singapore 's national carrier is hoping to become the world's first airline to get all of its crew members vaccinated against Covid-19.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) confirmed to CNN Travel that all of their crew members -- including pilots, gate agents, flight attendants and anyone whose job requires contact with the public -- have been offered free coronavirus vaccines by the Singaporean government.

The country has purchased the Pfizer vaccine , which requires two shots.

""We are grateful to the Singapore government for making the aviation sector a priority in the country's vaccination exercise,"" the airline's CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said in a statement that was emailed out to the whole company on January 18.

""This reflects the sector's importance, and the crucial role we play in both Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against the pandemic.""

According to the airline, 5,200 SIA employees have already signed up to get their shots. Inoculations will begin in a few days.

Phong, alongside Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung, was among the city-state's first citizens to get vaccinated. He has received the first of his two shots, and reports that ""the procedure was painless and fuss-free.""

Once vaccinated, crew members will be subject to less scrutiny and fewer coronavirus-related security measures. For example, flight crew who are currently tested on the seventh day after their return to Singapore will be exempt from this test going forward.

Singapore's response to the pandemic has been largely successful due to border closures and a national contract-tracing app. The country has had 59,113 confirmed cases of the virus and only 29 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Still, citizens of the city-state have expressed an interest in being able to travel again.

373,Qantas reveals details of record-breaking Project Sunrise flights,"(CNN) — Qantas has taken an important step toward launching Project Sunrise, its long-dreamed-of goal to establish direct flights between Australia and the cities of New York and London.

The airline has ordered 12 Airbus A350-1000s planes, with hopes that the ultra-long-haul routes can begin operating in 2025.

In total, there will be 238 total seats on each plane, which is the lowest number for any Airbus A350s currently in service. Those seats are spread between four classes of service -- first class, business class, premium economy and economy.

Comfort will be a must, as these flights will clock in over the 19-hour mark, making them the world's longest non-stop flights.

Renderings for the plane interiors give some clues about what Qantas is planning for passengers on board.

Images of the first class cabins show separate beds, reclining lounge chairs and even closets.

Meanwhile, the least expensive economy class seats will have a pitch of 33 inches, which compares with an average 30-31 inches on most carriers.

""Wellbeing Zones"" will use communal areas of the plane to store healthy snacks and drinks as well as provide travelers a place to get up and stretch.

Qantas' custom planes will have beds in all First Class cabins. Qantas

A dream years in the making

Australia's national flag carrier has made no secret of its goal to run direct flights between Melbourne and Sydney in Australia and New York City and London.

Qantas has dubbed the scheme ""Project Sunrise."" The name was inspired by clandestine World War II flights that were made from Perth to Sri Lanka en route to London. They were fraught with danger, and lasted so long they saw two sunrises.

""For more than 100 years, Qantas has been at the forefront of transforming the way the world travels, particularly through direct flights,"" Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement.

""Now, the A350 and Project Sunrise will make almost any city in the world just one flight away from Australia. It's the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance that has traditionally challenged travel to Australia.""

In 2019, the airline ran a series of test flights on the Sydney to New York City and Sydney to London routes as an experiment.

The crew and passengers on board had their health monitored during the journey to see how such a long flight could affect future fliers. Tracking devices monitored sleep patterns, activity cycles, food and drink consumption and other data.

Like many travel projects around the world, Sunrise was derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Last year, the CEO told CNN's Richard Quest that ""once we finish (upgrading Qantas' domestic fleet), which we'll do early in 2022, we'll revisit Sunrise and the likelihood is somewhere like 2024 or 2025 for the first aircraft arriving, given the delay.""

Although the first Project Sunrise flights are still years away, Qantas has already started thinking about expanding its ultra-long-haul offerings.

The airline confirmed that Paris and Frankfurt are also being considered for future direct flights after the New York City and London routes are established.

374,How greed fueled Lebanon’s deadly milk and medicine shortage,"A pharmacy employee looks through mostly empty medicine cabinets at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut.

A pharmacy employee looks through mostly empty medicine cabinets at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut.

Beirut/Akkar, Lebanon — Ammouneh Haydar sits on a plastic chair in the sparsely furnished apartment she hasn’t left for a month. As the sun sets, a single fluorescent lamp casts its weak glow across the room. Within minutes, a power outage lasting 22 hours will reduce the place to darkness.

Haydar, 32, will confine herself to her tiny home in the village of Tleil near the Syrian border for another ten days. Her husband, Ibrahim Urfali, was killed in a fuel tank explosion in mid-August, and she is adhering to a mourning tradition common for grieving widows in some conservative Muslim communities in Lebanon, refraining from contact with men for 40 days.

Tears stream down her cheeks during a moment of quiet reflection. Her six-year-old, the couple’s second-born, pulls Haydar’s face to his and showers it with kisses, seemingly desperate to ease his mother’s agony.

She forces a small smile.

Haydar’s tragedy is emblematic of her country’s crisis.

Like the vast majority of Lebanon’s population, her material losses have multiplied at breakneck speed since the country’s financial disaster began two years ago. The family’s already modest earnings have been whittled down to almost nothing. Rampant shortages have deprived her of the ability to adequately feed her four children.

Even as local television stations screened images of large amounts of stockpiled infant formula at the end of August, Haydar says she couldn’t find any to buy for her seven-month-old son. She says she resorted to feeding him hot water mixed with sugar.

Lebanon’s financial crash was fueled by the greed of a commercial elite, and it is ordinary people like Haydar who are paying a high price — in her husband’s case, the ultimate price — for it.

Deadly side-effects of hoarding

The country’s economic depression has been driven by a rapid depletion of public finances, exacerbated by what the World Bank says was “deliberate” mismanagement of the crisis on the part of the ruling elite. But the hoarding of essential goods has also dealt the economy a devastating blow.

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati said last month that traders and “corrupted people” have withheld 74% of the country’s subsidized goods — fuel, medicine, food and baby formula — from the public over the past year. This accounts for around $7.4 billion of the $10 billion Mikati says the state spent on subsidies in a year.

Import data, statements from the Central Bank and dozens of interviews with pharmacists, doctors, patients and aid workers conducted by CNN point to an increase in some subsidized goods coming into Lebanon in the first half of 2021 when many parents were struggling to feed their babies, cancer patients didn’t have life-saving drugs and diesel exhaustion caused hundreds of businesses to temporarily shutter.

The fuel tank explosion which cost Haydar’s husband his life highlights the potentially devastating impact of hoarding.

On August 14, Lebanon’s military seized a tanker-load of fuel from a smuggler in Tleil, 110km from Beirut.

In the early hours of the following day, troops tried to distribute the diesel to scores of local men desperate to fuel the generators that power their families’ homes. Ibrahim Urfali was scrambling for a share when the tank exploded, killing at least 31 people, and leaving more than 79 injured.

His wife said Urfali suffered burns to more than 95% of his body.

He and the others gravely wounded in the blast were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Some of the medication they needed was missing, and its absence was chalked up to Lebanon’s financial tailspin.

Several of the wounded were flown overseas for treatment, another sign of how far the fortunes of Lebanon — for decades the medical capital of the Middle East — have fallen.

After unsuccessful efforts to fly him abroad, Urfali died.

Days after he succumbed to his burns, Lebanon’s health ministry revealed that more than 6,800 ampules of one of the missing medicines — albumin — had been found in a Beirut warehouse piled high with hoarded medication.

Albumin is a drug typically used to treat severe burns and resuscitate lost fluids, which doctors CNN spoke to said is essential to lowering morbidity rates.

The discovery of the Albumin stockpile, in an affluent Beirut neighbourhood, came during health ministry raids on more than 10 storage units — which the ministry said mostly belonged to importers and pharmacists — in which huge amounts of hoarded medications and baby formula had been stashed away.

“We found all the kinds of medicine and baby formula we had been looking for,” one health ministry official who participated in the raids on warehouses, and who asked not to be named, told CNN.

The medication and formula seized in the raids has since been distributed to hospitals and others in need, the health ministry said.

The Health Ministry says several of the warehouse owners who hoarded medications have been arrested and that evidence gathered in the raids has been forwarded to Lebanon’s judiciary.

The raids appear to have stopped since a new government was formed in early September. The country’s new health minister, Firass Abiad, did not respond to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on why this was the case.

Subsidies and smuggling

In 2020, in the midst of a deepening financial crisis, the Lebanese government started to subsidize essential goods in response to hyperinflation and rising unemployment. With a majority of goods imported the move was seen as a lifeboat, but the plan — seen by experts as unsustainable — soon backfired.

Local media reports highlighted the illegal smuggling of fuel to Syria. After traders bought fuel in Lebanon at subsidized prices, they reportedly took it across the border to sell at global market rates, leading to significant profits. As the local currency plummeted, profit margins grew. The lira has lost over 90% of its value in two years, whereas global markets have been largely unchanged.

“The [Central] Bank essentially financed the profits of traders,” Zouhair Berro, head of the Consumers Protection Association, a Lebanese watchdog group, told CNN. “Through stockpiling, traders would wait for the price to rise and then sell it at a high price. In this way, very little reached the people.”

The Central Bank claims it warned the Lebanese government about the abuse of subsidies since last June, but their claims have been met with widespread skepticism. The bank has been repeatedly accused of of aiding capital flight from Lebanon and helping the commercial elite shore up profits in the face of the country’s financial freefall — accusations bank officials reject.

At the height of Lebanon’s fuel crisis in July — when queues at petrol pumps extended for miles and power outages spiked dramatically — the country’s Central Bank spent around $800 million on fuel imports, Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh told local media in August. That money would typically sustain Lebanon for three months, he said.

Army raids on petrol pumps in August uncovered tens of millions of litres of hoarded petrol, according to state media and multiple videos showing fuel stockpiles.

In June, Lebanon’s Central Bank largely stopped supplying dollars to banks to extend lines of credit — an essential part of the subsidy mechanism — to importers of infant baby formula and medicine, saying it could no longer afford the drain on its reserves, and citing a significant discrepancy between its bloated import bill and shortages in the market.

“The bill for medicine and healthcare supplies in the first half of 2021 exceeds the entire bill of 2020,” the bank said in a statement in July.

The bank said it had been billed around $1.5 billion on medicines and infant formula in the first six months of 2021 alone, compared to $1.173 billion it had paid in the whole of 2020.

“The numbers just don’t add up,” said another high-ranking Central Bank official. “We discovered these big figures … we went out of our minds.”

Data from Euromonitor International, a strategic market research group, also showed a boost in baby formula imports in the first half of 2021. Lebanon’s pharmaceuticals importers syndicate chief Karim Gebara also acknowledged a growth in medicine imports, though he accused the central bank of attempting to exaggerate import growth in the medicine sector.

“We believe that [the Central Bank’s] analysis is not correct … the data of the order of pharmacists says no, there is a growth of around 10% between this year and last year,” he says. “We also took data of an international company that do analysis of markets. They say the market grew by 10%.”

Gebara says medication imports stopped in May when a pre-approval process for medicine importers was halted by the Central Bank. In August, the Bank said it resumed pre-approvals for subsidized medicines. However, when CNN interviewed doctors at four major hospitals a month later, they said the medicine crisis had not been alleviated by the change.

CNN interviews with aid workers, pharmacists and new mothers also found that while shortages of baby formula and other essential supplies intensified this summer, they began several months before the Central Bank effectively paused the subsidy program.

Asked why the Central Bank paused supplying dollars for subsidies, a high level bank official, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN it was “because we can’t continue … We don’t have money anymore. It’s done.”

Inside Lebanon’s public hospitals

At Lebanon’s biggest public hospital, the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the mood is sombre.

Dejected looking patients and their loved ones sit on the ground outside the main entrance. There is no toilet paper in any of the bathrooms — one nurse helpfully offers someone a medical mask instead.

Medical staff and patients alike, it seems, are battling not just shortages of medicine and essential supplies, but a sense of impending doom.

Tharwat crouches by a windowsill in the oncology ward, staring into the distance. The 50-year-old has just been diagnosed with Amyloidosis, a heart condition which requires treatment with a chemotherapy medication that neither she nor her doctors can find.

“I don’t understand it,” Tharwat, who asked not to be fully identified, says. “I don’t understand how I can’t find medication.” As she says this, her sister breaks down in tears and scurries out of the room.

“I’m someone who loves life,” Tharwat, wide-eyed and emaciated, explains. “I had a beauty shop. I had customers who I loved. Why is this happening to me.”

“The absolute worst part of my job is when I have patients with curable cancers, but who I cannot treat,” RHUH’s Head of Oncology, Dr. Issam Shehadeh, tells CNN, adding that the majority of cancer patients in Lebanon now cannot receive treatment.

In the hospital’s basement, the mood in the pharmacy is akin to that in a morgue.

The department’s head Raida Bitar opens cabinet after cabinet, refrigerator after refrigerator. Each is empty, or mostly empty: Chemotherapy drugs, medications to raise blood pressure, medicines to treat pregnant women — all missing.

Bitar says some patients have died because the hospital ran out of one cheap and usually widely-available drug, Noradrenaline. “They died because we couldn’t raise their blood pressure.”

An international aid organization recently donated supplies of Noradrenaline to the hospital, so the pharmacy now has a small amount in stock.

Bitar says newborn babies have died because of a lack of Magnesium Sulfate — also recently donated — which is given to mothers who suffer from hypertension.

“These are all very cheap medications,” she says. “Magnesium Sulfate costs 10 cents per ampule.”

“This isn’t only a financial problem,"" she adds. ""This is a problem of shortages. Suppliers are greedy, the Central Bank isn’t managing the crisis well, the previous government didn’t manage the crisis well. And patients are paying the price.”

Even upper middle-class patients are not immune from the effects of the crisis.

Carine Abou Saab, who is battling Hodgkin's Lymphoma, underwent an incomplete course of treatment because of the lack of immunotherapy drugs.

When she tried to get hold of the missing medication herself, the serial number on the drug she secured was wrong — suggesting either that it was counterfeit, or that it had been exported from Lebanon to Syria only to be reimported and sold on the Lebanese black market at a higher price.

While Abou Saab was being treated, her three-year-old daughter Maria was diagnosed with leukemia. Abou Saab managed to get hold of the medication Maria needed, but says that given the ongoing crisis in Lebanon, she would prefer her to be treated in Portugal, where Maria is a citizen.

“We feel trapped here. As soon as Maria’s immunity improves, I’m going to take her out,” says Abou Saab.

To alleviate the shortages, non-profit organizations and community groups have stepped in. One of these, the Barbara Nassar Association for Cancer Patient Support, is helping cancer patients secure medication through its international networks.

Hani Nassar, who co-founded the organization with his wife, Barbara, days before she died of cancer, says it's impossible to keep up with the growing demand.

""If the relatives of patients only knew what was happening in cancer wards, they would commit a massacre,” he says. “Doctors and nurses are having to choose between who gets treatment and who doesn't — basically who gets to live.""

The Barbara Nassar Association, which normally helps cancer patients therapeutically, has turned to helping them find life-saving drugs. Wigs for cancer patients are on display in the organization’s offices.

‘I can’t even tell you how I feel’

Less than a kilometer from Ammouneh Haydar’s house in Tleil, lies an abandoned villa, its exterior blackened by smoke. The property belonged to the alleged smuggler whose confiscated fuel exploded in the deadly August 2021 tank blast.

A group of vigilantes torched the home in an act of revenge — one of a number of isolated acts of retaliation in a country where distrust runs deep, and where despair is so widespread, most feel there is little point trying to assign blame.

“Everyone exploited us,” says Haydar.

Recounting the litany of tragedies that have befallen her family, it is her inability to properly feed her seven-month-old that brings tears to her eyes

“There’s a huge difference in how I fed my older children when they were infants,” says Ammouneh. “Because of the shock that happened to me, I can’t breastfeed. I need baby formula. But there is no baby formula.”",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2021/10/world/lebanon-shortages-intl-cnnphotos/
375,"There's a shortage of truckers, but TuSimple thinks it has a solution: no driver needed","(CNN) Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide , exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic.

One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.

Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

In the case of electric bikes, the future is now: one retailer reported the sale of e-bikes and e-scooters had increased 230% this year. E-bikes give the user a boost to their pedaling, allowing them to go further with less effort. E-bikes are now even available on ride-share apps, like Uber.

In December 2019, Canadian airline Harbour Air flew the world's first all-electric, zero-emission commercial aircraft. The six-seater seaplane was retrofitted with magniX's magni500 all-electric motor. Harbour Air -- which carries half a million passengers annually -- hopes to become the world's first all-electric airline.

Hydrogen aviation could provide a sustainable solution for short and medium-haul flights. In September, Airbus unveiled plans for three hydrogen-powered, zero-emission aircraft which can carry 100 to 200 passengers. It hopes to launch the first ZEROe aircraft in 2035.

No sleep

TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself.

""Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,"" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO.

The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. ""In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,"" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard.

Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.

Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.

""We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,"" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls ""virtual railroads,"" and nowhere else.

According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024.

Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.

Happier drivers?

The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver.

""If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,"" he said.

That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the ""middle mile,"" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. ""A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,"" said Lu.

TuSimple's autonomous fleet.

Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving.

""Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,"" said Lu.

No distractions

Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.

Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. ""The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,"" he said.

Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night.

""In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,"" said Lu. ""The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/world/tusimple-autonomous-truck-spc-intl/index.html
376,A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuries,"(CNN) Working in a factory or warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.

The ""Ironhand"" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%.

The Swedish company describes the system as a ""soft exoskeleton."" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.

Reducing fatigue

""When you have the glove on, it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects,"" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director. ""It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.""

The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.

378,Dubai's audacious Heart of Europe megaproject nears first stage completion,"Dubai (CNN) — What strikes home as the shuttle boat approaches the $5 billion megaresort being constructed off the coast of Dubai is its sheer audacity.

Nearly two decades in the making, the Heart of Europe forms just one section of The World -- a vast collection of man-made islands roughly in the shape of an atlas -- but when completed it will be the opulent centerpiece.

In the middle of a pandemic, it could yet prove to be a work of genius in its efforts to recreate the continent of Europe for upscale vacationers unwilling to make the trek.

Amid a global travel downturn caused by Covid, it also represents a major leap of faith in Dubai's long-term allure.

After a four-kilometer boat ride from the mainland, the World's 300 artificial islands rise up out of the Arabian Gulf like inverted golf bunkers.

Most of these have stood empty since the project began in 2003, with subsequent global financial downturns doing little to encourage developers.

And then the Heart of Europe (HoE) comes into view.

No fewer than 15 luxury hotels, vacation homes and billionaire mansions now stand or are beginning to appear on these aquatic plots. Most are still unfinished, awaiting the final touches needed to meet the first completion deadlines at the end of 2020.

Six themed islands form the Heart of Europe, with travelers able to choose between locations designed to replicate Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Venice, the Cote d'Azure and others.

The concept is that, once they've arrived, guests should be able to convince themselves they've been transported from often sweltering Arabian heat to less arid climes.

Snowballs in the heat

On Sweden island, ""palaces"" are built beneath roofs that resemble upturned Viking boats. HEART OF EUROPE

On Sweden island, the surreality of this concept can literally hit you like a snowball in the face.

Within the island's vast $21.8 million show mansion -- one of 10 ""palaces"" beneath rooftops resembling upturned Viking ships -- is a basement housing kitchens, a gym, spa and sauna ... and a snow room.

White flakes are delivered on demand against an alpine backdrop from machinery powered by the same Arabian sunshine warming the infinity pool upstairs.

The mansion's epic scale and unbridled yet tasteful opulence is stunning.

Surrounded by un-Scandinavian lush jungle, the boutique hotel-sized six-level homes come with an elevator as well as a private beach.

Exclusive furnishings by high-end car maker Bentley include plush seating for lavish dinner parties at a table the length of a limo, a circular bed with ocean views and a huge marble tub.

Further up, a domed party lounge larger than many bars can accommodate 300 guests -- ideal for those post-pandemic celebrations.

They'll be able to toast their neighbors over in Germany -- an impossible gesture in real life geography, yet feasible in the Heart of Europe atlas.

The design of Germany island's 32 futuristic beach or lagoon-facing dwellings are inspired by Bauhaus, but more closely resemble a lunar colony. Only one of these remained unsold at the time of writing, with a $7.89 million price tag.

World firsts

The Portofino resort on Main Europe island, like the celebrity coastal enclave it's named for, has a colorful Italianate facade.

Arrivals here will be checked in by Italian-speaking employees, working to clocks set to the Italian timezone. They'll be able to spend euros here -- surreal again for a resort just minutes by boat, helicopter or seaplane from mainland Dubai.

""Coming here you should forget you are in Dubai and feel you have reached Europe,"" says Josef Kleindienst, the Austrian chairman of Kleindienst, the real estate group developing the islands.

""You should have the impression you've come to Italy and then you walk and come to Spain and France and to London.""

Portofino's colorful demeanor extends to the boutique hotels in the Côte d'Azur area of Main Europe island. These are named after French Riviera playgrounds Monaco, Nice, Cannes and St. Tropez and will be staffed by French speakers.

Here developers promise more world firsts, including the largest sustainable swimming pool, fed by solar-power desalinated sea water and nature-friendly filtration.

Main Europe is also the location of Rainy Street, a thoroughfare climate-controlled to 27 C (80 F) to mimic a European summer climate where showers fall on demand and a snow plaza issues icy flurries.

In a country that rarely experiences natural precipitation, these quirky concepts will likely be relished by UAE guests.

Floating police station

One resort, Cote d'Azur, is intended to evoke the French Riviera. HEART OF EUROPE

The Heart of Europe has already proven popular with citizens in the region. Kleindienst says most of its recent real estate investors hail from the UAE.

The project's first phase is slated for completion by close of 2020, with all three phases due to finish by 2023.

By then it will include The Floating Lido -- a Venetian-inspired resort comprising a hotel, the world's first underwater spa and gym and a floating beach.

The completed project will include Switzerland, with 77 mountain chalet-inspired villas.

There will also be a floating police station and a circus featuring hologram animals.

Other hotels will be named for locations such as Spain's Marbella and Ibiza, Germany's Munich, Greece's Ikaria and London.

The heart shaped ""Honeymoon Island"" is for newlyweds. HEART OF EUROPE

And there will be a dedicated wedding hotel -- St. Empress Elizabeth -- and heart-shaped Honeymoon Island, where newlyweds can relax on sunrise and sunset-designated beaches.

While the idea of artificial islands laden with resorts in a destination already boasting hundreds of hotels may seem like an exercise in excess, Kleindienst highlights efforts to improve or preserve the environment.

At the Coral Institute, located in the Portofino resort, several aquariums and tanks display a breeding program that centers on 50 local species, including carpet sharks.

The sharks, not considered dangerous to humans, will ultimately reside around the islands as part of the developer's ""seahabilitation"" program to ""expand the marine ecosystem and help rebalance the underwater environment.""

Meanwhile, native and migratory birds are already discovering extensive greenery introduced to the landscape.

Hanging gardens on hotel facades and painstakingly relocated Spanish olive trees aged 100-1,500 years appear to be prospering.

'Prosperous environment'

The plan is to create 147 ""Floating Seahorse"" villas. HEART OF EUROPE

The Coral Institute is nurturing 20 local varieties of living coral, eventually destined to enrich at least 500,000 square meters of reef with 100,000 corals a year.

These will be particularly visible to occupants of the futuristic Floating Seahorse villas, individual dwellings that will have rooms above and below the waterline -- some of which are currently on sale.

""This is their village,"" says Kleindienst's marketing director, Delphine Cazals, as nimble shoals of fish probe existing coral beyond the subaquatic window of one of what are being touted as the world's first three-level floating villas.

Ultimately there will be 147 Floating Seahorse villas anchored in three ""colonies"" around HoE.

At sea level, a swish lounge and dining area, also furnished by Bentley, opens onto a sundeck, while an open-air top floor yields further entertaining space complete with a mini kitchen, seating and hot tub.

As with the rest of the megaproject, Seahorse villa design and construction follows guidance from world-renowned Feng Shui Master Victor Li Dexiong -- promoting ""a prosperous and happy environment,"" intended to appeal to Chinese buyers.

But across the Heart of Europe project, unusual construction circumstances have brought challenges.

For Kleindienst these have included the need to strengthen the surface of islands to ensure surface durability, and sourcing suitable construction technology to comply with strict zero discharge environmental policies written into The World vision from inception.

Those close to HoE stress the completed resort will not be a cultural theme park, but an upscale second home and vacation destination.

Besides property investors, it will target international tourists seeking alternative hospitality experiences and UAE residents expanding their staycation horizons.

With the pandemic set to impact economies and international tourism for months to come, Kleindienst says he thinks fewer overseas tourists will be balanced by the local market, eventually resulting in a 50/50 mix.

He says the Heart of Europe was targeted toward domestic traffic since the beginning, with its ""getting away without getting on a plane"" scenario.

What remains to be seen is whether the completion of this megaproject will galvanize owners of remaining The World islands which, 12 years after emerging from the sea, are still to be developed.

Kleindienst believes they are watching his progress.

""For sure... other island owners want to see if you are earning money, if you earn money, they will also move,"" he says.

Being separated from the mainland, HoE was also able to remain Covid-free when 1,200 island-based construction workers and other staff, including the chairman, went into a voluntary two-month isolation during the first wave.

As a consequence, while much of civilization came to a standstill, construction boomed as crews opted to work longer to earn extra cash while staying put.

""They were happy, we were happy,"" says Kleindienst, who confirms HoE was initially touted for completion in time for Dubai's Expo 2020 -- now postponed until October 2021.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/dubai-heart-of-europe-nears-completion/index.html
379,Architects have designed a Martian city for the desert outside Dubai,"Written by Poppy Koronka, CNN

Dubai is a city where firefighters use jetpacks, archipelagos are built from scratch , and buildings climb into the clouds ; a slick metropolis in the middle of a vast red desert. First-time visitors would be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled onto a film set for a sci-fi movie.

Now Dubai is set for what must be its most other-worldly architectural project yet.

In 2017, the United Arab Emirates announced its ambition to colonize Mars within the next 100 years. But architects are already imagining what a Martian city might look like -- and planning to recreate it in the desert outside Dubai.

Mars Science City was originally earmarked to cover 176,000 square meters of desert -- the size of more than 30 football fields -- and cost approximately $135 million.

Intended as a space for Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) to develop the technology needed to colonize Mars, architects Bjarke Ingels Group were asked to design a prototype of a city suitable for sustaining life on Mars -- and then adapt it for use in the Emirati desert.

How to build a Martian city

For this unique commission, the architects first had to overcome the immense challenges of creating a design to make the inhospitable environment of Mars habitable.

Mars has a thin atmosphere and no global magnetic field, so there's little protection from harmful radiation. Temperature is another problem -- the average on Mars is a chilly -63 degrees C (-81 degrees F). The thin atmosphere also means there's little air pressure, so liquids quickly evaporate into gas; despite freezing temperatures, an unprotected human's blood would boil on Mars.

But according to Jonathan Eastwood, director of the Space Lab at Imperial College London, who's not connected with the Dubai project, the challenges of living on Mars extend far beyond technicalities.

""I think the biggest challenge in terms of a sustained presence on Mars is not the engineering [or scientific] challenge, but the human [and] personal one,"" Eastwood explained.

""So not just to answer the question about how do you survive, but how do you thrive?""

Martian vernacular architecture

Hoping his design will allow for the latter, Jakob Lange, partner at Bjarke Ingels Group, explained to CNN how he and his team plan to overcome the challenges posed by the Red Planet.

To maintain a comfortable temperature and habitable air pressure, the Martian city would be made up of pressurized biodomes each covered with a transparent polyethylene membrane. Oxygen, made by applying electricity to underground ice, would fill each biodome.

As the population on Mars grows, biodomes would be joined together to form villages and eventually form cities in the shape of rings, or ""toruses.""

The city would be powered and heated using solar energy, and the thin atmosphere could actually help the domes maintain their temperature.

""Since there is very little atmosphere on Mars, the heat transfer will be very low, meaning that the air inside the domes will not cool down as fast as it would on Earth,"" said Lange.

Buildings would be 3D printed under the domes, using Martian soil, and rooms would extend 20 feet underground, protecting from harmful radiation and meteors.

The unearthly design even becomes a little playful in places. ""In the future on Mars, you would have skylights in your underground cave that would be like aquariums, with fish swimming around,"" said Lange. The water-windows would shield the residents from radiation while allowing light to enter the underground rooms.

No longer bound by Earth's physics, Martian architecture can take on a whole new form.

""There is approximately one-third gravity which means that you can suddenly make columns that are [slimmer] and [have] longer spans of structures,"" Lange said. ""It creates almost like a completely new rule set that you have to follow when designing architecture in space.""

According to Eastwood, the design meets the challenges posed by Mars. ""I think [these design elements] definitely [are] part of the key infrastructure for a long-term presence,"" he said. ""The idea of gradually shielding [from radiation] is sensible [...] The idea of water windows is quite elegant.""

MBRSC says the Science City is still in the concept stage, and that it hasn't yet settled on a design or architect for the final build, but BIG has already worked out how it would adapt its proposal for the Dubai desert, if selected.

On Earth, domes wouldn't need to be pressurized or filled with oxygen, and buildings would be 3D-printed from desert sand rather than Martian soil. But the water skylights would still be present, and it would also be powered by solar energy.

In BIG's design, as well as research labs, Mars Science City will contain an educational facility, museum, an amphitheater, and co-working office space.

As yet, there's no timeline for when construction will begin, or when it will open, but MBRSC says it is currently conducting a detailed study of the specifications, which it will use to develop a revised budget and size for the site.

Dreaming of Mars

Mars Science City is only one part of the ambitious space program run by Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. Last year it sent its first astronaut into space ; this summer it will launch a probe to Mars , and in November it will undertake its first-ever analog mission.

The eight-month venture will take place in Russia and one Emirati crewmember will be chosen as part of an international team of six. The mission will test the effects of isolation and confinement on mental and physical health.

Other places on Earth used to mimic conditions for space missions include Antarctica's Concordia Station, used to simulate isolation, California's Mojave Desert, which NASA has used to test Mars rovers, and the Moroccan Sahara, used by the European Space Agency as a Mars analog.

The MBRSC hopes that, in future, such research could take place in Mars Science City.

""This is going to be our platform where we can develop the science [and] the technology that will help us in our future missions to Mars,"" said Adnan AlRais, Mars 2117 Program Manager at MBRSC. ""We want to come up with a totally new facility that will help the international community.""

To reach its goal of colonization in less than a century, the MBRSC acknowledges enthusiasm for space travel will have to pass down multiple generations. It hopes Mars Science City will inspire the next generation to dream of life on the Red Planet enough to make it a reality.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/mars-science-city-design-spc-scn/index.html
380,This designer is giving the ancient art of henna a modern makeover,"Written by Rebecca Cairns, CNN

With a history spanning millennia across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, henna is steeped in tradition and cultural rituals. The natural dye is typically used to create temporary, intricate body art for religious festivals and celebrations, such as weddings.

Now, Dubai-based designer Azra Khamissa is on a mission to give the ancient practice a modern makeover.

A pioneer of striking minimalist designs, Khamissa has built a following of more than 100,000 on Instagram , and her creative ideas have led to brand collaborations with fashion houses including Gucci and Fendi.

Her aim is to create henna designs that align with fashion trends, along with henna products that can be sold through major cosmetics retailers. Khamissa would like to see henna worn all the time -- not just on special occasions.

An ancient art

Henna is made from plant leaves. Its origins as a cosmetic product are unknown, but it has ""been used for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes"" including coloring hair and nails, and decorating hands and feet, says Ade Solihat, a lecturer and researcher of Arab Studies at Universitas Indonesia.

During Khamissa's childhood, henna was often used for family celebrations like Eid, she says. But as she got older and developed her sense of style, she would ""dread"" occasions where she had to adorn herself with flowery designs.

Khamissa's attitude to henna started to change at a friend's wedding in 2017. Preparing for the ceremony, she experimented by decorating the center of her palm with a disc (a design called rubeya, in Arabic) and coloring her fingertips (rawayeb, in Arabic). Usually ""only grandmothers"" would wear this design, says Khamissa, but its simple, bold minimalism appealed to her.

A week later, Khamissa attended a photoshoot for her eponymous handbag brand, where the photographer captured her henna-covered hands. When Khamissa saw the images, she began to see henna in ""a different light."" Subseqently, she launched her career as a henna artist.

""I just kept exploring different traditional designs, and then started adding my own touch to them,"" she says.

Khamissa tests new designs on her own hands first. When she runs out of space, her sister and grandmother volunteer their hands. Her grandmother isn't always a fan of her modern interpretations -- but when she responds positively, Khamissa knows she's onto a winner: ""Whatever she likes, I know is a great success, because that's the real traditional eye meeting up with something new and different.""

Minimalist and modern

In her work, Khamissa reinterprets traditional ornate floral patterns as pared-back line drawings of single flowers, and replaces complex mandalas with simple geometric shapes. Some designs pay homage to traditional North African and Arabic motifs, while others -- topographical outlines, abstract desert landscapes, and politically inspired flags and words -- are her own unique creations.

Khamissa says the temporary nature of henna -- which lasts around two weeks -- allows for more ""crazy"" and experimental patterns, like all-over leopard print. For those who don't want to ink themselves permanently, henna offers more flexibility and ""makes tattoo culture a bit more inclusive,"" Khamissa says.

She isn't alone in taking a modern approach to henna. Fellow UAE-based henna artist Amreen Wahid draws delicate floral designs with a contemporary feel, and beauty bloggers have used henna to create freckles and beauty spots.

Solihat, the Arab Studies specialist, says henna is no longer tied to ""symbolic and sacred meanings."" Modern approaches help it to ""cross borders, ethnicities, and identities,"" she says, adding that it is now popular among demographics without a henna heritage, ""especially among the urban young generation.""

Beauty store henna

It's not just Khamissa's designs that are modern -- she wants to update the way henna is sold, too.

Typically, fresh henna paste, or the raw ingredients to make it, are available only at specialist stores.

""There's a huge gap in the market,"" says Khamissa. ""You can't find henna in a Sephora or Boots, major pharmacies or beauty stores. I want to make it more accessible.""

Khamissa hopes her designs will inspire people to embrace henna and wear it in a more casual, contemporary way. Credit: Azra Khamissa

But there's a major barrier -- henna paste has a shelf-life of just a few days. Most off-the-shelf henna pastes contain preservatives and some contain PPD (paraphenylenediamine), a synthetic dye that can cause serious allergic reactions

A solution to the shelf-life problem would be mini-freezers, which could keep henna paste fresh for up to six months, says Khamissa. She is considering designing her own freezers to allow her to scale up and sell henna in cosmetics stores.

In the meantime, Khamissa started selling a non-toxic henna kit in May 2020. Other henna specialists, such as Dubai Henna , have established online platforms, reflecting growing demand.

Khamissa hopes that by making high-quality henna more accessible, more women will be inspired to get creative with body art in their everyday styling. ""Henna should be like getting your nails done, your hair done, your makeup done for a look. Adding henna just tops it off beautifully.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/azra-khamissa-modern-henna-hnk-spc-intl/index.html
381,How Naomi Campbell surprised this Nigerian designer on the runway,"Written by Rebecca Cairns, CNN

Supermodel Naomi Campbell has been turning heads since she first started modeling in the 1980s. But for Nigerian fashion designer Chukwuma Ian Audifferen, her appearance at the Arise Fashion Week ""30 Under 30"" showcase got his attention for another reason.

""Naomi Campbell closed the runway show in my piece and it was sublime,"" said Audifferen of the December event, which celebrates young African designers.

The 30-year-old said he was ""startled"" when he saw the supermodel strutting down the runway in Lagos, Nigeria in the geometric-patterned poncho. ""I had no idea that she was going to wear my piece. She just looked like perfection.""

In a hyper-competitive industry, the ""surreal"" moment is cemented in Audifferen's mind as one of his career highlights.

""It was one of those moments that made fashion so worthwhile for me,"" he said.

From backstage to onstage

Audifferen didn't always want to be a designer. After high school, he studied microbiology at the University of Lagos -- a career he said his father was keen for him to pursue.

But Audifferen's interests didn't lie in lab work, and during his studies, he interned for Lagos Fashion Week and Arise Fashion Week, a competition for young designers hosted by Nigerian media group Arise. It gave him a taste of the fashion world -- and he was eager for more.

After graduation, Audifferen began making shirts. ""(People) bought these items off my back,"" he said. ""I'd wear a shirt that I had made to an event or somewhere, and they would just want it.""

""The Tzar Studios ethos is pretty much comfort and functionality. I believe that when you're comfortable in your clothing, it's a confidence booster."" Ian Audifferen, designer

That's when he decided to put together a small collection, and in 2014 he founded Tzar Studios. The initial designs were ""resplendent and flamboyant"" he said, with a variety of bold and clashing prints and colors. Initially focused on menswear and androgynous unisex pieces, in 2018 Audifferen also began working on womenswear.

Now, his designs are more minimalist: ""The Tzar Studios ethos is pretty much comfort and functionality,"" he said. ""I believe that when you're comfortable in your clothing, it's a confidence booster.""

That year, he returned to Arise Fashion Week -- but this time, as a designer. ""I had worked backstage and coordinated the models; fast-forward years later, I'm on the runway showcasing my pieces. I see that as growth,"" he said.

After his first appearance on the runway in 2018, Audifferen says his designs started to get more recognition. Featured in magazines including Vogue and Genevieve , his work began attracting the attention of Lagos's fashion-savvy socialites.

Nigeria's flourishing fashion industry

Audifferen is now a key player in Nigeria's flourishing fashion scene, where an increasing number of young designers are taking the spotlight. Of the 30 designers selected for the Covid-compliant Arise Fashion Week in December 2020, 23 were Nigerian, including Audifferen.

Arise Fashion Week is an important event to help elevate these designers and give their work global exposure, Naomi Campbell told CNN.

""I feel that it's been long going on for too long, that designers on the continent have not gotten a platform in the fashion capitals of the world,"" said Campbell. ""Fashion is not supposed to discriminate, yet we have excluded this part of the world and other emerging markets.""

""Fashion is not supposed to discriminate, yet we have excluded this part of the world and other emerging markets."" Naomi Campbell, supermodel

Campbell has long been a champion of African designers and creatives, using her star power to bring international attention to events like Arise, and its young designers. Campbell is ""excited"" by the unique work coming from African designers, which is ""stuff that's not everywhere else.""

""They need to know that they're recognized and appreciated in the world of creative fashion, like all the other young rising stars in fashion capitals,"" Campbell said.

While the 2020 showcase was won by fellow Nigerian designer Kenneth Ize , Audifferen said the event was ""amazing"" and Campbell wearing his design on the runway -- which he has now renamed the ""Naomi poncho"" -- reminded him why he persevered in fashion for the past decade.

""It's so easy to quit. It's so easy to say, 'Oh, I'm done, this is too much,' because it is overwhelming,"" Audifferen said. ""But moments like that make it worthwhile. You literally live for moments like that.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/naomi-campbell-ian-audifferen-nigeria-arise-fashion-hnk-spc-intl/index.html
382,The 'anonymous' South African artist turning dreams into reality through photography and AR,"Written by Doménica Orellana, CNN

For the artist known as Xopher Wallace, it all started with a recurring dream he had as a child.

In the dream, he would speak to people around him, but they never engaged. When he looked at his reflection, Wallace realized he was only a silhouette.

In 2017, the South African visual artist decided to become ""anonymous,"" taking the alias Xopher Wallace and wearing goggles, a morphsuit and sweatshirt in his photographs to keep his real identity a secret. For him, being anonymous means that people can focus mainly on his art and he can preserve ""his authentic character.""

""In society I think we're under pressure to only show the good side in our lives, whereas in my work I express even some of my negative feelings or feelings that make me feel uncomfortable,"" Wallace said.

By using a blend of fine art photography and augmented reality , he merges the real and virtual worlds to bring his dreams to life. Wallace says he is also inspired by the Japanese anime series ""Mob Psycho 100,"" which uses imagery resembling the silhouette in his dreams.

""For me, dealing with empty spaces is also dealing with an empty canvas, so I could decorate it as much as I want,"" Wallace explained, adding he can shoot day or night, then digitally include extra visual elements such as lights or smoke.

For South Africa's Virtual National Art Festival 2020, Wallace contributed by creating face filters. He also curated an online exhibition called "" Afridelic Trip: Faces of Mixed Realities ,"" for the Fak'ugesi African Digital Innovation Festival, in which Wallace used artworks by fellow South African artist vonMash to design face filters and virtual galleries that presented the themes of ""African mysticism and spiritual realms.""

When the pandemic prompted nationwide lockdowns, shutting down galleries across the country, Wallace hosted his own online exhibition named ""Inside/Outside,"" inviting other South African visual artists to showcase their work. On the first day alone, Wallace said the event drew nearly 5,000 viewers.

Strengthening that online presence has allowed Wallace to expand the audience for his art, as well as help shine a light on other African digital artists.

""Times are changing,"" he said. ""People are looking into investing into the virtual realm instead of physical spaces.""

384,Cardinals' DeAndre Hopkins Suspended 6 Games for Violating NFL's PED Policy,"Christian Petersen/Getty Images

The NFL announced Monday that it has suspended Arizona Cardinals star DeAndre Hopkins for six games following a violation of the league's performance-enhancing drug policy.

Doug Sanders, Hopkins' brand manager, issued a statement Monday night, noting the receiver's camp is testing every product he has used to determine what caused the positive test:

Hopkins later issued a statement of his own, in which he apologized to the Cardinals and their fans:

Adam Schefter of ESPN first reported the news of the suspension.

According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Hopkins withdrew his appeal, making the ban official.

Depending on when the team might have been made aware of an impending ban for the three-time All-Pro, this could provide more context behind Arizona's trade for Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown from the Baltimore Ravens.

Hopkins will have missed 10 straight regular-season games by the time he's eligible to suit back up for the Cardinals. He missed Arizona's last four contest as well as the team's NFC Wild Card Round loss to the Los Angeles Rams because of a knee sprain. A hamstring injury had also sidelined him for three weeks in November.

Not surprisingly, the offense suffered a big drop when the veteran pass-catcher was unavailable.

In addition to acquiring Brown, the Cardinals selected Colorado State tight end Trey McBride in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft.

At the time, it looked like the organization was working to appease Kyler Murray amid the quarterback's reported contract standoff.

Instead, the Cardinals might have been fortifying their passing game to account for the fact that Hopkins will miss more than a third of the season.

It also might be fair to wonder whether Hopkins' long-term future in Arizona is now in jeopardy.

The 29-year-old is signed through the 2024 season after signing a two-year, $54.5 million extension in 2020.

Moving on in 2023 wouldn't be financially prohibitive for the team, though. Designating him as a post-June 1 cut next offseason would add $9.1 million as dead money in 2023 and 2024 but save the team $21.7 million, per Spotrac.

Regardless of what happens with Hopkins, Brown is likely to emerge as a big winner from this situation.

The 2019 first-round pick explained how he requested an exit from Baltimore, in part because of his usage within the Ravens offense.

Brown might now be the No. 1 receiving option on a team that averaged the fourth-most passing yards per attempt (7.8) and 10th-most yards per game (251.5). After eclipsing 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in 2021, bigger and better things could be in store for him.",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10034751-report-cardinals-deandre-hopkins-suspended-6-games-for-violating-nfls-ped-policy?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial
385,Report: Brittney Griner to Be Honored by WNBA with Decal on Every Team's Home Court,"Michael Hickey/Getty Images

The WNBA will honor Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner with a floor decal that will be displayed throughout the 2022 season, according to ESPN's Josh Weinfuss.

The design will include Griner's initials and her jersey number (No. 42).

The seven-time All-Star remains detained in Russia, having been taken into custody in February after customs officials said she was carrying vape cartridges that contained cannabis oil through airport security.

TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency, reported in March that Griner was due to remain in custody until at least May 19. ESPN's T.J. Quinn spoke with Tom Firestone, a former legal adviser for the U.S. embassy in Moscow, and he said Griner could remain in Russia for as many as 12 to 18 months before she's put on trial.

Firestone laid out to Quinn and Mechelle Voepel of ESPN how her situation was especially delicate given the politics at play:

""Sometimes cases like this are better off handled in a low-key approach through the criminal justice system. I think the concern is, if it becomes too high-profile, if it becomes political, then the Russian government may dig into their position. It may make it difficult for her to get a good resolution of the case, and she could become a pawn in a bigger political battle.""

The New York Times' Kurt Streeter reported that players around the WNBA have been purposefully mum on the matter on the advice of those close to Griner, ""who have determined it best to let behind-the-scenes diplomacy work.""

Mercury guard Kia Nurse offered her perspective to Streeter.

""We are absolutely outspoken about everything that we can possibly be,"" she said. ""But we are also very good at admitting that we don't know everything, and we are not the experts on every topic.""

The WNBA's gesture to honor Griner may not receive universal acclaim because her arrest has once again called attention to how many of the league's top stars play elsewhere for financial reasons.

""One of the narratives that the players have to go overseas is a little bit outdated and inaccurate,"" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told reporters on April 11.

Minnesota Lynx wing Aerial Powers offered a counter when she told Voepel, ""We go over there to make a living.""

The Arizona Republic's Jeff Metcalfe reported in March 2017 that Griner was earning around $1 million by suiting up for Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg. While the most recent collective bargaining agreement raised player salaries across the board, Griner's supermax contract guarantees her around a quarter ($227,900) of what she makes overseas.

Connecticut Sun star and reigning WNBA MVP Jonquel Jones also made it clear she'll continue to play year-round.

""I'm going to have to deal with it,"" she said to ESPN's Alexa Philippou. ""Because I feel like while the league is making the right and necessary strides to pay us more and ensure that if we don't want to go overseas, we don't have to, I just feel like in my situation, the money is not comparable.""

The WNBA's gesture toward Griner—while well-intentioned—will likely again raise questions about what else the league is doing to address the underlying problems that allowed this to happen in the first place.",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10034772-report-brittney-griner-to-be-honored-by-wnba-with-decal-on-every-teams-home-court?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial
386,Ex-UVA Lacrosse Player George Huguely V Ordered to Pay $15M In Wrongful Death Lawsuit,"M. Anthony Nesmith/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

A jury ruled Monday that George Huguely V, who is a former University of Virginia lacrosse player serving a 23-year prison sentence for the murder of Yeardley Love, must pay $15 million in damages in a wrongful death lawsuit.

Denise Lavoie of the Associated Press reported the jury ruled Huguely must pay $7.5 million each in compensatory damages to Love's mother, Sharon Love, and her sister, Lexi Love Hodges.

The wrongful death lawsuit initially asked the jury to award $29.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages to Sharon Love, who is the administrator of Yeardley's estate.

Huguely and Yeardley Love were both lacrosse players at Virginia who had a relationship.

He was convicted of second-degree murder during a 2012 criminal trial after she was found beaten to death in her apartment in 2010. A medical examiner ruled the cause of death to be blunt force trauma to her head.

While the jury awarded the compensatory damages to Love's family, it did not award any punitive damages.

Huguely's lawyer, Matthew Green, argued his client had drunk heavily prior to confronting Love in her apartment and was not aware she died until questioned by police. Therefore, Green said, it was not the ""willful and wanton"" conduct necessary for punitive damages to be awarded.

Huguely himself testified he does not remember the majority of the details from that night, including when he broke into her room and fatally injured her.

""I miss her and think about her every day,"" he said to Love's mother and sister. ""I would do anything to take back that night. I take responsibility for what happened to her and I should have never gone over to her apartment that night.""",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10034781-ex-uva-lacrosse-player-george-huguely-v-ordered-to-pay-15m-in-wrongful-death-lawsuit?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial
387,2023 NFL Mock Draft: B/R's Way-Too-Early Predictions,"0 of 32

Jay LaPrete/Associated Press

The 2022 NFL draft is old news already. The 2023 draft cycle is underway, with Bleacher Report's first projection for the next class.

As the league emerges from another hectic yet productive weekend that included 262 draft picks and hundreds of more undrafted players signed to rosters, the best evaluators already have had one eye toward next year's event in Kansas City.

Some anecdotal evidence could be seen during this year's edition, specifically with the quarterback position.

Everyone understood the incoming quarterback crop was one of the weakest in recent memory. Even those teams with significant needs didn't force their hands and draft a prospect just to take one. Ultimately, Kenny Pickett became the lowest-drafted QB1 since Jim Druckenmiller in 1997. No other quarterback heard their names called until the third round. General managers already know next year's quarterback class should be much different.

Team-building is a multi-year venture. One can't make moves in a vacuum. As such, it's important to start early on evaluations and what may come almost a full year from now.

Of note, Draft Kings' Super Bowl odds determined the current draft order. Coin flips broke any ties, and the slotting had to be adjusted slightly to fit the traditional draft set up (i.e., an even amount of teams from both conferences making the playoffs).",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2955668-2023-nfl-mock-draft-brs-way-too-early-predictions?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial
388,2 People Shot After Argument During Youth Flag Football Game in Virginia,"AP Photo/Tyler Kaufman

An argument at a flag football event in Manassas, Virginia, on Sunday morning led to a shooting that injured two men, per Lindsay Watts of Fox 5 DC.

Dean Ladson, a parent of an 11-year-old player and an organizer of 703 United Youth Football, said there were a few hundred children and spectators at the Benton Middle School fields at the time of the shooting. Multiple flag football games were scheduled at the time.

Ladson said that he saw an argument take place on the sideline during the game and that he tried to de-escalate the situation. He then said he was right next to the shooter when he pulled out a gun and shot two men before running away from the scene.

He also spoke with Megan Rivas of WUSA9 about the incident:

Per Watts, Prince William County Deputy Police Chief Jarad Phelps said that investigators are attempting to identify the shooter at this time. The department also reported that the two men who were shot were transported to local hospitals to receive treatment and that the scene was secure and stable.

Per Justin Jouvenal of the Washington Post, the ages and conditions of the victims were not immediately available.

As Bill Hutchinson of ABC News wrote, this incident marks the third reported time in seven days that a shooting has taken place at or near a youth sporting event in the United States.

On April 25, gunshots rang out at a parking lot near youth baseball fields in North Charleston, South Carolina, while games were going on. Last Friday, nearly two dozen gunshots rang out near a freshman high school baseball game in Chicago.",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10034724-2-people-shot-after-argument-during-youth-flag-football-game-in-virginia?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial

According to TMZ Sports, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said the man got into an altercation with the father of a player from the opposing team at The Mill Works facility in Westford, Massachusetts, on Sunday. Police were called to the location ""for a disturbance"" and a report of a man with a firearm.

Video circulated on social media showing parents and kids running away in a horrifying scene.

The man who allegedly pulled out the gun had fled before police arrived, but witnesses were able to describe the vehicle he was driving. Police eventually identified and arrested Jose Mow, saying they found a firearm in a diaper bag inside his vehicle.

Mow was charged with six counts, including possession of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon. He was arraigned Monday morning in a Massachusetts courtroom and ordered to stay in jail until he posts $1,000 bail.

""This was a frightening and potentially dangerous situation that has no place in youth sports,"" Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said. ""We have put a focus in Middlesex County on building a culture of safe and respectful behavior on the sidelines at these types of events, and that is not what occurred yesterday. These types of altercations among adults are unacceptable and can have lasting impacts on our young people.""

This is just the latest ugly incident involving AAU basketball. Earlier in April, multiple youth basketball players allegedly assaulted a referee immediately after a game in Lithonia, Georgia, leading to a police investigation.

Mow's next court date is scheduled for June 6.",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10034765-34-year-old-man-arrested-for-allegedly-pulling-gun-out-at-aau-basketball-game?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial

391,'Spring Awakening: Those You've Known' celebrates the musical and its stars,"(CNN) Part valentine to the theater, part unconventional love story, ""Spring Awakening: Those You've Known"" celebrates the show and its original cast, while also providing a broader look at the issues of teen rebellion and alienation that turned the musical into a sensation. Or just come for the adorable interplay between

The principal hook involves a reunion of the cast in 2021 as a one-night benefit concert for the Actors Fund, 15 years after its debut. That includes seeing not only the performance but the preparation for it, interspersed with footage of the musical from the past and discussion of its profound impact on those who flocked to it.

The most emotional thread, however, involves Groff, who hadn't yet come out as gay at the time, and Michele, who began workshopping ""Awakening"" as a 14-year-old, practically grew up on the stage and fell in love with him, before the two became enduring friends.

Even now (or rather, then), Groff is caught tearing up seeing Michele sing again, and recalls being honest with her before the rest of the world. A month after leaving the show, he says, ""I came out of the closet, and I started my life.""

393,Naomi Judd talked about her depression and worked to help others with it,"(CNN) In announcing their mother Naomi's death Saturday, Ashley and Wynonna Judd wrote that they lost their ""beautiful mother to the disease of mental illness.""

It was something that Naomi Judd had been open about.

She wrote about her battle with severe depression and anxiety in her 2016 memoir, ""River of Time: My Descent into Depression and How I Emerged with Hope.""

""It's the account of hitting rock bottom and rising again to be thankful for taking my next breath, for the gift of clear thought, for wrestling from a nightmare a way to find joy in each day,"" Judd wrote in her book.

While promoting her memoir, Judd explained during an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that her depression had been treatment resistant.

""They tried me on every single thing they had in their arsenal,"" Judd said at the time. ""It really felt like, if I live through this I want someone to be able to see that they can survive.""

""Nobody can understand it unless you've been there,"" Judd told People in 2016. ""Think of your very worst day of your whole life -- someone passed away, you lost your job, you found out you were being betrayed, that your child had a rare disease -- you can take all of those at once and put them together and that's what depression feels like.""

Her experiences led Judd, who was a nurse before she became famous, to begin advocating for mental health care.

In an essay for NBC in 2017, Judd said her condition kept her ""inert for two years"" and devastated her daughters and her husband, Larry Strickland, whom she married in 1989.

She advised those suffering from depression to seek assistance from ""people that you trust.""

""It helps if they've known you a long time, because they can see that there's a pattern. You have to raise your hand and say, 'I'm in deep you-know-what',"" Judd wrote.

She shared her struggles with the hope of helping others feel less alone, Judd wrote in the forward to her book, and to thank those who helped her.

""Even in the darkest days,"" Judd wrote, ""I was never blinded to the compassion from my beloveds who continually reached down with loving hands and lifted me out of my harrowing nightmare of despair.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/entertainment/naomi-judd-depression/index.html

397,The new 'Star Trek' series couldn't come at a better time,"(CNN) Rod Roddenberry Jr . is the only son of ""Star Trek's"" iconic creator, but he never watched the show growing up. He was more into cars, heavy metal music and watching action television shows like ""Starsky & Hutch"" and ""Knight Rider.""

""It wasn't until I got older and more mature that I began to appreciate the depth and the intellectual side of 'Star Trek,'"" says Roddenberry, who was 17 when his father, Gene, died.

Years later, Roddenberry had a Trekkie conversion experience. He started watching reruns and talking to fans who told stories of the show helping them develop more faith in humanity. That's when he started to appreciate his father's optimistic vision of a future where people learned to delight in differences and ""i nclusivity and equality are the nor m.""

Roddenberry is now all aboard ""Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,"" which premieres May 5 on Paramount+. A prequel to the original series that aired in the 1960s, it's based on the years that Capt. Christopher Pike, a fan favorite who appeared in the original series, led the USS Enterprise.

The new show, one of many ""Star Trek"" spinoffs, has been billed as a return to the optimism and romanticism of the original series, which ran from 1966-69.

Such a idealistic worldview may be a tough sell to today's audiences, battered by hateful politics, violence, war and dire warnings about a rapidly warming planet. But it's a change that Roddenberry, an executive producer with the new show, applauds.

""Saying nothing bad about the other shows, but this is the one I'm most excited about,"" says Roddenberry, CEO of Roddenberry Entertainment, which develops sci-fi graphic novels, podcasts, television and film projects.

""It's going to go back to the formatting of the original series. It's the kind of thing we need to get out there to give us hope,"" he adds. ""I understand that this is just a TV show, but it inspires countless people to live better lives.""

What we can expect in the new series

Akiva Goldsman , the show's executive producer, says the new series will be different and yet the same. Fans should expect more stand-alone episodes, more of the original series' optimism and mind-bending twists reminiscent of ""The Twilight Zone.""

Another wrinkle is the new show's focus on some of ""Star Trek's"" iconic characters. The show will examine the evolution of such characters as Spock and Uhura before they became mythic figures, Goldsman says.

Celia Rose Gooding as young Uhura and Ethan Peck as young Spock in the new series, which streams on Paramount+.

""Our Uhura is young. She starts off as a cadet,"" Goldsman says. ""Where does she come from? What decisions did she make to allow her to be in Starfleet and become the heroine we know her to be?""

Another big change is in the captain's chair. The character of Captain Pike is much different than Kirk, Goldsman says.

""Jim Kirk is a young boy's fantasy of a 'Star Trek' captain,"" Goldsman says. ""He's brash, impulsive -- he knows the rules but doesn't follow them. He's a swashbuckler. Pike is a thoughtful man of reason who builds consensus.""

There are countless debates in the Trekkie universe about what television version of ""Star Trek"" is better, and whether subsequent series departed too much from the optimistic tone of the original. That optimism is reflected in the voiceover m onologue by Captain Kirk at the beginning of each episode. He says the goal of the Enterprise is to ""seek out new life and adventure,"" and ""explore strange new worlds"" -- not to conquer civilizations or force inhabitants to accept certain beliefs.

By contrast, subsequent versions of the show, like ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" featured some characters who were morally compromised or sometimes made decisions that contradicted their values.

Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in the original ""Star Trek."" The actors' interracial kiss onscreen was considered bold for its time.

Ben Robinson , co-author of ""Star Trek -- The Original Series: A Celebration,"" says he hopes that a return to the franchise's ""original recipe"" will preserve the hopefulness of the first series while offering complex, characters with moral struggles.

""I am looking for the original series, with a 21st century budget,"" Robinson says. ""If they can combine sophisticated stories with beautiful special effects and the 1960s 'Right Stuff' energetic storytelling, then I'm going to be over the moon.""

Why hopeful storytelling is never outdated

One of the unstated questions in the new series is one you won't see on many of the show's discussion boards: Will Star Trek's optimism and emphasis on inclusivity feel outdated in today's cynical world?

It's hard to have faith in humanity by looking at news headlines. Racial, ethnic and political divisions seem as deep as the outer reaches of space itself.

Then again, feel-good, inclusive TV series such as ""Schitt's Creek"" and ""Ted Lasso"" found huge audiences in the pandemic, a trend many attribute to audiences being starved for hopeful stories.

""Dark times require hopeful storytelling,"" says Goldsman. ""Optimism and belief in a better future is necessary for a lot of us.""

Goldsman says it's a myth that the original ""Star Trek"" aired in an gentler era that was much different than ours. He cites 1968 as an example.

""We were at war,"" he says of the US's involvement in Vietnam. ""The civil rights movement was still in its own intense moment of conflict. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were killed, not to mention the looming nuclear threat. The country was quite factionalized. The '60s were a tumultuous time.""

""Star Trek's"" futuristic world allowed it to address some of the most explosive issues of that era in a way that no other show could, says Robinson, the author. The composition of the Enterprise crew was itself a call for tolerance, he says.

The crew of the USS Enterprise in the original ""Star Trek"" included a Black woman, an Asian man, a Russian and a Vulcan -- a symbolic coalition of unity and equality.

Consider: The US was embroiled in a cold war with the Soviet Union, but one of the Enterprise's main officers was Russian ( Chekov ). The country had only 20 years earlier ended a brutal war with Japan, but the ship's helmsman was Japanese ( Sulu) . Black people couldn't vote in many parts of the country, but a Black officer -- and a woman -- ( Uhura) was the ship's communications officer.

Spock was the ultimate model minority on the Enterprise. He was an outsider who endured prejudice. Black and biracial people identified with him (there's a beautiful story about the actor Leonard Nimoy writing a letter to a biracial girl who felt rejected). One Star Trek fan called him the ""Blackest person on the Enterprise"" because he ""never let 'the man"" see his emotion and ""was cool like the best jazz musicians.""

""It's metaphorical storytelling that allows you a way of taking science and fantasy to look at your own society,"" Robinson says. ""He [Roddenberry Sr.] talked about race by having a Vulcan instead of a Black guy.""

The 'troubled soul' of 'Star Trek's' creator

It's a minor miracle that Star Trek's creator was so hopeful about humanity. He saw and experienced so much tragedy during his lifetime. Roddenberry Sr. was born in El Paso, Texas, and almost died as a toddler when his house caught fire. A passing milkman rescued him.

He had more close calls as an adult. He was a pilot for the US Army Air Corps who flew combat missions in the South Pacific during World War II. And he was a crew member of a Pan Am flight that crash-landed in the Syrian desert, killing 14 people. A later stint as an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department exposed him to the seamier side of life.

Actors Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and William Shatner pose for a portrait with ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry, rear, and director Robert Wise, just left of camera, during the filming of the 1979 movie, ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture.""

And yet despite all that, Roddenberry imagined a compassionate and harmonious future world that was much different from the one he lived in.

How can someone who'd seen so much tragedy be so optimistic?

Robinson, the author, pointed to a quote from musician John Lennon.

""Lennon said the reason I go on about peace and love so much is because I'm really angry,"" he says. ""Maybe you look for what you need for yourself. Gene was a troubled soul for sure.""

Roddenberry converted his pain into a vision of the future that still inspires millions more than 50 years later. Phrases such as ""Live long and prosper,"" ""Beam me up, Scotty"" and ""warp drive"" are now part of popular culture.

And so is ""Star Trek's"" humane message, which lives on in the new show.

""If people say, 'Why is 'Star Trek' still around?', I will tell you why,"" Roddenberry Jr. says. ""It's because it's the idea of appreciating all of the things that are different and not just tolerating them, and that it's the differences that we're going to grow from.""

The response to ""Star Trek: Strange New Worlds"" will reveal whether that vision still resonates with people, or whether the barriers of cynicism and hate are now too high for even the USS Enterprise to steer through.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/entertainment/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-blake-cec/index.html

399,The 'Pachinko' finale highlights the real-life women whose stories aren't found in history books,"(CNN) At the center of "" Pachinko ,"" the Apple TV+ adaptation of Min Jin Lee's epic novel, is a character named Sunja -- a woman born in Japanese-occupied Korea who leaves her homeland for the imperial country in the early 20th century.

It's a sweeping tale of immigrant resilience, of identity and belonging, of historical trauma that echoes through generations. But though its themes are universal, ""Pachinko"" is rooted in a specific history, a critical chapter of which is at risk of vanishing.

That reality makes the final minutes of the season especially remarkable.

The eight-episode season, which chronicles how Japanese colonialism shapes the lives of Sunja and her descendants, ends with documentary footage of real-life Sunjas -- Korean women who moved to Japan between 1910 and 1945 and remained there after World War II. The resulting interviews with these first-generation women offer a glimpse into that period not found in history books.

""This was a group of people whose stories weren't considered important enough to record or tape,"" showrunner Soo Hugh recently told CNN. ""There's not that much photographic evidence, especially from that first generation. That told me that this was a story worth telling.""

The eight women briefly profiled at the end of ""Pachinko"" are almost all more than 90 years old -- one has surpassed 100. They faced countless hardships and systemic discrimination in the country they now call home but, as the season's closing sequence says, they endured. Yet, Hugh said, many of them had been made to feel that their lives weren't noteworthy.

Afraid that the women's stories might be lost to time, Hugh felt an urge to include their voices in the series. She wanted to honor their experiences for the world to see.

'Pachinko' captures a painful history

""Pachinko"" protagonist Sunja leaves her village in Korea in the 1930s for Japan after unforeseen circumstances lead her to marry a man bound for Osaka. When she arrives, she discovers that life for Koreans in Japan is largely one of struggle and sacrifice.

For many Koreans of that generation, Sunja's experience is a familiar one.

In ""Pachinko,"" Sunja (Minha Kim) and her husband Isak (Steve Sanghyun Noh) leave Korea for a new life in Japan.

As Japan sought to expand its empire in East Asia, Koreans migrated to Japan in large numbers. Some moved to the land of their colonizer in search of economic and educational opportunities -- others had little choice in the matter. Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were conscripted as laborers during Japan's war efforts and made to work long hours for scant pay , while some Korean women were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military. Along with grueling work and substandard housing, Koreans encountered racism and discriminatory treatment.

""I came here at 11 and started working at 13,"" Chu Nam-Sun, one of the Korean women interviewed for the series, says in the documentary footage. ""I grew up in sadness. So it's hard for me to be kind to other people. I do wonder if that's because of how I grew up.""

Koreans who migrated to Japan during colonial rule, as well as their descendants, are known in Japanese as Zainichi , which translates to ""residing in Japan."" Jackie Kim-Wachutka, a researcher who consulted on the show and conducted the interviews at the end of the season, has spent decades documenting the experiences of Zainichi Korean women.

When she started interviewing first-generation Zainichi women 25 years ago, she realized she was learning about a history that was rarely written about: What everyday women did to survive.

""They were really painting a canvas of migrant life and everyday struggles,"" said Kim-Wachutka, whose book ""Hidden Treasures: Lives of First-Generation Korean Women in Japan"" became required reading for the ""Pachinko"" writers room. ""And their everyday struggles were not only about their home. The majority of the women worked outside of the home.""

Sunja (Minha Kim) and her mother (Inji Jeong) navigate the hardships of life in Japanese-occupied Korea.

Just as Sunja sells kimchi at the markets to keep her family afloat, the women Kim-Wachutka met through her research went to great lengths during Japan's colonial period to make a living. They resorted to brewing bootleg alcohol and journeyed to the countryside for rice they could sell on the black market. Whatever skills they had were put to use.

""In all of these women's stories, I see so much of Sunja in 'Pachinko,'"" she said.

So when Hugh came to her with the idea to interview some of these women for the adaptation, Kim-Wachutka gladly agreed. It was important to her that viewers see the parallels between the show's characters and real people who lived that history.

Women like Sunja struggled and survived

Despite Japan's hostile treatment of Korean migrants, Sunja stays in the country even after its rule over Korea ends.

For successive generations of Sunja's family, including the series' other central character Solomon, Japan is home -- even though they are often made to question whether they truly belong.

Though Sunja and her family find that life is difficult for Koreans in Japan, they remain and raise their children there.

While the majority of Koreans in Japan returned to their homeland after World War II, the women that Kim-Wachutka interviews at the end of ""Pachinko"" are among the estimated 600,000 Koreans who stayed.

""I can't go to Korea,"" Chu Nam-Sun tells Kim-Wachutka in a mix of Japanese and Korean. ""I can't go to my country, so this is my hometown now.""

Rennie Moon wrote in a 2010 Some families had finally achieved a measure of stability and didn't want to risk starting over again, others felt their children had integrated into Japanese culture and yet others simply couldn't afford the journey back. The Koreans who remained in Japan did so for various reasons,Rennie Moon wrote in a 2010 article for Stanford University's SPICE Digest.Some families had finally achieved a measure of stability and didn't want to risk starting over again, others felt their children had integrated into Japanese culture and yet others simply couldn't afford the journey back.

""I don't like saying this, but my children couldn't live in Korea,"" Kang Bun-Do, 93 at the time of her interview, says. ""So I made sure they assimilated into Japanese society.""

While Koreans in Japan were considered Japanese nationals under colonial rule, that changed after World War II, rendering them effectively stateless. In the decades following the war, they were subject to numerous exclusionary policies due to their supposed status as foreigners, compelling many Koreans to choose between ""passing"" as Japanese to bypass discrimination or asserting their Korean identity despite the inherent challenges.

Yuh-Jung Youn as the older Sunja in ""Pachinko.""

As Zainichi Koreans successfully fought to regain many of their rights in the '70s and '80s, blatant discrimination began to decline, John Lie wrote in a 2009 article for the journal ""Education About Asia."" But though Japan has since apologized for some of its actions during its colonial rule, racist attitudes toward Koreans persist to this day.

Life for the first-generation women interviewed at the end of ""Pachinko"" has been marked by struggle, but that isn't all that defines them. Ri Chang-Won alludes to how proud she is of her son and her grandchildren. Chu Nam-Sun is shown flipping through a photo album, marveling at how long ago those memories seem. Still, she hasn't looked back.

""There were no hardships for me in the life I chose for myself,"" she adds. ""I made my own way, my own path, so I have no regrets whatsoever about the path I chose and walked down.""

Their accounts help us reckon with the past and present

In sharing these stories with the world, Hugh said she wanted to ensure that the women had agency and that they didn't feel that they were being used for the show. And in the end, she said, many of them described the experience of being interviewed as a form of healing.

A particularly revealing moment comes at the end of the footage, when Kim-Wachutka comments on Ri Chang-Won's bright smile. Ri doubles over laughing, as if astonished to receive such a compliment. When she finally regains her composure, she speaks once more.

""I'm sure it must have been boring, but thank you for listening,"" she says of her story.

The stories of first-generation Zainichi women, much like the Sunja's journey in ""Pachinko,"" open up important conversations around race, oppression and reconciliation -- not just as it relates to Koreans in Japan but in communities all over the world, Kim-Wachutka said. Listening to their stories, she said, can help us reckon with the injustices of the past, and perhaps avoid repeating them.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/entertainment/pachinko-apple-tv-plus-finale-zainichi-korean-women-cec/index.html

402,"Bill Murray speaks out about 'Being Mortal' film shutdown, saying 'I did something I thought was funny, and it wasn't taken that way'","(CNN) Actor and comedian Bill Murray addressed the production shutdown of his latest film, ""Being Mortal,"" in the wake of reports of a complaint against him.

Fox Searchlight told the film crew in an email last month that the film was being shut down due to an unspecified complaint but didn't confirm Murray was involved, Deadline first reported on April 20.

On Saturday, Murray was attending the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The actor, who's a shareholder, told CNBC that he had a ""difference of opinion"" with a woman on the set of ""Being Mortal."" But Murray said he was optimistic that he and the woman, whom he didn't name, could ""make peace.""

""We had a difference of opinion; I had a difference of opinion with a woman I'm working with. I did something I thought was funny, and it wasn't taken that way,"" Murray said. ""The company, the movie studio wanted to do the right thing. So, they wanted to check it all out and investigate it and so they stopped the production.

403,'It's Gonna Be May' meme turns 10 years old,"(CNN) It's gonna be May -- for the 10th year in a row.

The iconic Justin Timberlake ""It's gonna be May"" meme, a play on the singer's pronunciation in the *NSYNC song ""It's Gonna Be Me,"" has officially been around for a decade.

The meme, featuring a fresh-faced, boy band-era Timberlake, was created by Kianna Davis when she was a student at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia.

""I had been planning my busy April calendar and posted it as a joke to my friends,"" Davis said in an interview with her alma mater.

Davis, who now works for an education software company, had been a fan of *NSYNC since 1998.

405,Analysis: 'Ozark' and 'Grace and Frankie' return for final episodes,"A version of this story appeared in Pop Life Chronicles, CNN's weekly entertainment newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here

(CNN) They say all good things must come to an end, but personally I hate it.

We need more good things, so why can't we just keep the ones we have and add more to the bunch?

Apparently, that's not the way it works, and this week we see the series finales of two fan-favorite shows that shall be mourned.

Three things to watch

'Ozark' season 4, part 2

(From left) Laura Linney as Wendy Byrde and Jason Bateman as Marty Byrde are shown in a scene from season four, part two, of ""Ozark.""

For the final season of ""Ozark,"" Netflix split it into two parts. Way to keep us hanging on.

Netflix describes the crime drama as exploring ""capitalism, family dynamics, and survival through the eyes of (anything but) ordinary Americans."" I would like to add to the list the master class performances often captured in the scenes between costars Jason Bateman and Laura Linney.

The final episodes started streaming on Netflix Friday.

'Grace and Frankie' season 7, part 2

(From left) Lily Tomlin stars as Frankie Bergstein and Jane Fonda as Grace Hanson in ""Grace and Frankie.""

Lucky number seven.

Actually, unlucky for those of us who love this series about two women whose husbands leave them for each other, causing the older ladies to form an unlikely friendship.

""Grace and Frankie"" is ending after seven seasons, and we will miss Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin's chemistry as they play the title characters. Their escapades made us laugh and cry. And they are a great reminder that it can be greater, later — so keep hanging in there.

The second half of the final season started streaming Friday on Netflix.

'Bullsh*t The Game Show'

Howie Mandel hosts ""Bullsh*t The Game Show.""

You have to love a game show where you don't have to give the correct answer in order to win.

Instead, you just have to lie convincingly enough to make your fellow players believe that your answer is correct. If you are successful, you climb the money ladder and have the chance to win big bucks.

I have to say that this show, hosted by Howie Mandel, is reminding me a great deal of real life. The show's motto is: ""To win big in this game you don't have to be the smartest person in the room to cash in, you just have to convince everyone that you are.""

Don't we all know someone who seems to have risen to success with BS, or is that just me?

It's streaming on Netflix now.

Two things to listen to

Miranda Lambert attends the 53rd annual CMA Awards at the Music City Center on November 13, 2019, in Nashville, Tennessee.

Way to follow up winning Entertainer of the Year at this year's 57th annual Academy of Country Music Awards, Miranda Lambert.

She's releasing her eighth studio album, titled ""Palomino,"" and the country star shows she's still game for stretching creatively — whether she's collaborating with the B-52′s on ""Music City Queen"" or covering the title track from Mick Jagger's 1993 solo album, ""Wandering Spirit.""

""I can put out whatever I want and sound like whatever I want and look like whatever I want,"" she told Rolling Stone

""Palomino"" dropped Friday.

Kehlani attends the Los Angeles premiere of ""The Harder They Fall"" at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on October 13, 2021.

Kehlani, who prefers the pronouns they/them, is looking to take us on a journey with ""Blue Water Road.""

Their third studio album released Friday, and Kehlani said ""Blue water road is a destination in my mind.""

The artist got their start as the lead vocalist for the group called PopLyfe, who appeared on the talent competition ""America's Got Talent.""

The story of how that show's former host, Nick Cannon, helped them become a successful solo artist has become legend in the music industry. Kehlani's new album was reportedly written with a group of collaborators and friends in Malibu, California.

""Everything going on right now is heavy,"" they said last September in an interview with Rolling Stone. ""Now, not only am I not in a heavy time, but I'm starting to get out of the mindset of 'When are we getting back to normal?' And more like, 'This is our new normal.'""

One thing to talk about

(Back row, from left) John Legend and Chrissy Teigen and (front row, from left) their children, Miles and Luna, celebrate Luna's birthday at Disneyland on April 14 in Anaheim, California.

I love when we find out that celebs can be so normal.

Such was the case with Chrissy Teigen sharing how her and John Legend's 3-year-old son, Miles, is not exactly acing T-ball.

As she explained, Miles had never even seen a baseball game and had no idea where first base was after he scored a hit in a game.

""We're not an athletic bunch. But John (Legend) is so proud,"" she said. ""Everyone's like 'Drop the bat!' You have to explain every part. Like, of course, he wouldn't know to drop the bat. But it's so sweet.""

The couple also have a 6-year-old daughter, Luna.

Something to sip on

Johnny Depp's defamation trial against Amber Heard is giving us a glimpse into the private lives of celebrities that I'm not sure we all need.

Depp is suing his ex-wife for $50 million over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she described herself as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse.""

Heard did not name Depp in the opinion piece, but he has claimed it cost him work. He had denied Heard's allegations of domestic abuse.

The testimony so far has been ... intense, to put it mildly.

Celebrity trials can often feel very salacious, but given the long timeline of drama between Heard and Depp, it didn't feel like there would be many revelations. But that couldn't have been further from the truth.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/entertainment/ozark-grace-frankie-finales-plc/index.html

""It would depend on the context but, yeah, I'd consider it,"" said Pfeiffer.

It sounds like that wouldn't make Michael Keaton, who played opposite Pfeiffer in that role n 1992's ""Batman Returns,"" unhappy.

""She pulled off the almost impossible combo of sexy, ironic, tragic, dangerous and just plain good,"" he told the publication.

408,Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship timeline,"(CNN) Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are currently spending their days in a Fairfax, Virginia courthouse.

Depp, who concluded his testimony this week, is suing his ex-wife for $50 million over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed she wrote.

How they landed there --13 years after first meeting -- is a story of an on-set spark turned brief marriage gone wrong.

2009

Depp and Heard first met on the set of the film ""The Rum Diary"" in 2009.

Based on Hunter S. Thompson's book of the same name, the movie stars Depp as a journalist named Paul Kemp who takes a job in Puerto Rico. Heard played Chenault, who Kemp falls for at first sight.

On the witness stand in the defamation trial , Depp described the connection he felt with Heard when a scene called for their characters to kiss in a shower.

""That moment, was, it was, it felt like something, it felt like something I should not be feeling,"" Depp said, explaining they were each in other relationships at the time. ""I think there was something in the kiss in the shower that was real.""

Depp testified the two next saw each other two years later on a promotional tour for the film.

2012

Depp denied the accusations and a $7 million settlement was reached out of court in August 2016. Heard pledged to donate the money to charity

The actors released a joint statement at the time stating, ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.""

2018

Heard penned a op-ed for The Washington Post in December of 2018 about the treatment of women in domestic abuse cases. She did not mention Depp by name.

Depp acknowledged in his testimony that he and Heard had arguments during their relationship but said, ""Never did I myself reach the point of striking Ms. Heard in any way nor have I ever struck any woman in my life.""

At the conclusion of his testimony this week he was questioned by his attorney, Jessica Meyers, about a piece of audio that was played for the court.

""What did you say in response when Ms. Heard said, 'Tell the world, Johnny. Tell them, Johnny Depp, I, Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim, too, of domestic violence'?"" Meyers asked Depp.

""I said, 'Yes. I am,'"" Depp responded.

409,Dolly Parton now says she'd accept a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame if she's chosen,"(CNN) The widely beloved, ever-humble Dolly Parton said in a new interview that she'd ""accept gracefully"" if inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, one month after she said she wanted to withdraw her nomination.

Speaking to NPR about her new book with James Patterson, ""Run, Rose, Run,"" Parton said that she'd ""just say thanks and I'll accept it because the fans vote"" if selected to join the storied music institution. She previously said she hadn't felt she'd ""earned that right"" to be inducted into the hall of fame.

Parton told NPR that when she said she wanted to ""respectfully bow out"" of the nomination process , she thought the hall of fame ""was for the people in rock music."" The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has made an effort to induct artists whose work isn't neatly defined as ""rock,"" including Jay-Z, Madonna and Johnny Cash, among many others.

""So I just felt like I would be taking away from someone that maybe deserved it, certainly more than me, because I never considered myself a rock artist,"" she said in a Friday interview. ""But obviously, there's more to it than that.""

In her initial statement, Parton said she didn't want ""votes to be split because of [her]"" and asked the hall of fame's voters to reconsider her if she's ""ever worthy.""

412,"Michael Douglas says Debra Winger bit him, confirming longtime Hollywood rumors","(CNN) Michael Douglas has spoken out for the first time about refusing to work with actress Debra Winger after she allegedly bit him on the arm.

Appearing on the 100th episode of Rob Lowe's podcast ""Literally!,"" the 77-year-old star confirmed longstanding Hollywood rumors that Winger lost the female lead role in the 1984 action adventure ""Romancing the Stone"" following their bizarre encounter.

The movie, produced by Douglas and directed by Robert Zemeckis, tells the story of Joan Wilder, a romance novelist who falls in love with bird hunter Jack Colton (Douglas) in the Colombian jungle.

Debra Winger (center) starred alongside Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson in ""Terms of Endearment.""

At the time, Winger was one of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses, having starred in the ""Wonder Woman"" TV series and the Oscar-winning hit ""An Officer and a Gentleman.""

According to Douglas, he and Zemeckis met with Winger at a Mexican restaurant in Texas while she was shooting ""Terms of Endearment,"" hoping to cast her as Joan. However, the dinner didn't end quite the way Douglas envisioned.

413,Spider-Man remains one of the world's most popular superheroes. Here's what makes him a fan favorite,"(CNN) April 28 marks National Superhero Day -- and what's a better way to observe the occasion than to celebrate the world's most popular superhero?

If you go by at least one analysis of the past year's Google search data, that hero is Spider-Man. According to online entertainment retailer Zavvi, the web slinger is the world's most popular superhero with more than 5 million average searches per month.

But how has he earned that coveted spot in a heavily saturated market?

Talking to CNN, writer-performer and comic fan Reece Connolly describes Spider-Man -- his favorite superhero -- as ""a hero in its simplest form of just using what he has been given to help people.""

""He's normal. He's a young guy whose silliness and awkwardness make him one of the most relatable superheroes to exist. He isn't anything special, he's just normal.""

Connolly says that unlike Batman, his second favorite superhero, Spider-Man doesn't have ""billions of dollars in the bank. He's just more relatable than a billionaire who lives in a mansion on his own.""

He notes that Spider-Man's life -- full of issues at school and with his family -- features scenarios that many fans have experienced in their own lives.

""But it's more than that. He has a difficult, tragic life and yet still maintains that puppy-dog enthusiasm for life and keeps bouncing back,"" which is inspiring, Connolly says. The ""life lessons of being kind to others and taking responsibility,"" taught to him by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, are very present in the Peter Parker side of the character -- multiverse and all, Connolly observes.

A still from 2004's ""Spider-Man 2,"" starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web slinger.

Dr. Ilham Sebah, a psychologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, says the idea of ""bouncing back"" is synonymous with resilience -- ""the ability to adapt and cope with the stresses and adversities"" experienced in life.

""I like to think of it as 'bouncing forward,'"" Sebah tells CNN, noting that Spider-Man's adversities have equipped him with the skills and strategies to cope better in future predicaments.

Louise Phull, a fan of the Spider-Man movies, believes the superhero's ""vulnerability"" and ""character development"" make him more human and likable, especially when he sacrifices so much for the ""greater good.""

Positive psychology theorizes that quality of life can be bettered by subjective experiences (e.g. happiness and hope) and traits (e.g. love and perseverance), which is seen in how Spider-Man deals with whatever swings his way.

""He's constantly vulnerable, but manages to pull through it and never hit rock bottom"" and that's admirable especially for children who see him as a role model, Phull tells CNN, adding that the character's ""strong moral compass"" also plays a large role in his appeal.

This moral compass is epitomized in a phrase all Spidey fans know: ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" which is said to him by his uncle in most versions of Spider-Man's story, and by his aunt most recently in the 2021 blockbuster ""Spider-Man: No Way Home.""

The first issue of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was released in 1963. The character has maintained an enduring appeal, crossing over from comics to cartoons and live-action film.

""It's a very potent life lesson for everyone because whatever you've been given in life, it's your responsibility to literally use it to help better the world around you,"" Connolly says.

Spider-Man often has trouble balancing his web-slinging heroics with his non-superhero Peter Parker identity. As Parker he is often vulnerable and bullied by Flash Thompson, but occasionally the strength he shows in his alter ego rises to his defense. In "" The Amazing Spider-Man #2 "" comic book, Parker calls out Thompson, saying ""at least my brain isn't muscle-bound, like that fat head of yours!""

Connolly says his superpowers aren't the only thing ""special"" about Spider-Man because both Parker and the superhero are known for smarts and wit.

""Even when he's in the middle of a battle with the Rhino or the Lizard, he's still cracking jokes -- bad jokes a lot of the time, but they're often the best kind.""

In the ""Ultimate Spider-Man #1"" comic book, when the Green Goblin attacks his high school, Spider-Man quips: ""You wouldn't happen to be the new home ec teacher, would you?""

Sebah, who specializes in studying resilience, notes that humor is a common -- and effective -- coping mechanism, particularly when someone is experiencing grief.

During a pandemic that has wreaked havoc on lives across the world, it may be especially important for fans to see such resilience in an affable, well-loved character on the big screen.

""You find hope in these characters,"" Connolly says.

""When they are so well written and realized, they almost feel real. And they've been there for a lot of us for a long time, be it through comic books, movies, games,"" he says. ""And in dark times, it's good to go back to them and take heed of their lessons and take inspiration from them.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/entertainment/spider-man-national-superhero-day-marvel-comics-cec/index.html
414,'The Offer' mines the drama behind the making of 'The Godfather',"(CNN) Considering that one major fight over ""The Godfather"" was its length, there's some irony that the limited series devoted to the making of the classic film, ""The Offer,"" runs way too long. Setting that aside, this 10-part look back at Hollywood in the swingin' '70s is mostly good fun, anchored by Matthew Goode's appropriately scenery-devouring turn as Paramount boss Robert Evans.

The movie's producer, Albert S. Ruddy, is behind the series, which is credited as being ""based on Albert Ruddy's experience of making 'The Godfather.'"" If everyone is the hero of their own story that's certainly true here, with Ruddy (Miles Teller, who replaced Armie Hammer ) presented as fighting an honorable battle to preserve the film's artistic integrity while beset from every angle, including the Mafia, which took an inordinate interest in the subject matter of Mario Puzo's bestselling book.

A more familiar tension is that Paramount has been on a rocky path, with its impatient owners pressuring Evans to deliver at the box office. Careers are thus riding on the movie -- which became a huge commercial success in addition to winning the Oscar for best picture -- with everyone in danger of being fired in seemingly every episode.

No one appears more at risk than Ruddy, who finds Evans to be a mercurial ally, periodically prompting him to stage an end-run by going directly to the head of Paramount's parent company, Charles Bluhdorn (Burn Gorham), who sees flirting with Ruddy's assistant (""Ted Lasso's"" Juno Temple) as one of the key benefits to running a movie studio.

Created by Michael Tolkin (who wrote ""The Player""), ""The Offer"" is certainly a knowing look at Hollywood, with nods to showbiz history all along the way, like Paramount suits dismissing ""Chinatown,"" another eventual classic, as a ""water rights movie."" Evans is also thrown into a tailspin when his wife, Ali McGraw (Meredith Garretson), has a much-publicized affair with Steve McQueen while shooting ""The Getaway.""

415,'Ozark' cements its place among Netflix's best dramas with its final episodes,"(CNN) For anyone inclined initially to dismiss ""Ozark"" as ""Breaking Bad Lite,"" the Netflix drama has exceeded all expectations, steadily building toward a final run reinforcing the idea that getting into business with very bad people is going to have consequences. The fourth season has also become a family affair, adding a deeper hook to the Byrde saga that delivers tension right up until the last frame.

Perhaps foremost, the series has consistently tested the extent to which Marty (Jason Bateman) and his wife Wendy (Laura Linney) are willing to go to survive, as they try to navigate landmines that include drug dealers and the Feds in order to shed their dirty money-laundering business and buy their way back to Chicago.

Through the years, Marty has defined himself as the guy who can talk his way out of any situation, or at least try to, while Wendy has become increasingly ruthless, in a manner that has finally risked alienating their not-entirely-grown-up kids (Sofia Hublitz, Skylar Gaertner). In the ""Who can you trust?"" department, the Byrdes since the beginning have added each other to that calculus, but the question of whether they're working together out of love or necessity seems particularly acute now.

Julia Garner in 'Ozark.'

Similarly, the bifurcated season has explored the Byrdes' fractured alliance with Ruth (Julia Garner), while providing necessary reminders of the collateral damage done in their gradual descent into this world of illegality. It has also developed ancillary characters, like drug kingpin Omar Navarro (Felix Solis), with a complexity that demonstrates what could be stock threats can be oddly charismatic, though it's never wise to turn your backs on them.

The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be. Richard Thomas also plays a more significant role as Wendy's estranged father, who has come back into her life and, like almost everything else in ""Ozark,"" complicated it.

416,Nicolas Cage shows off his silly side playing himself (sort of) with 'Massive Talent',"(CNN) Nicolas Cage appears to have a great time spoofing his career in ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,"" but unlike many movies about Hollywood, audiences should have tons of fun too. Flanked by a very funny Pedro Pascal, the movie nearly buckles under its own weight at times but possesses enough goofy charm to validate this breezy exercise in Cage unleashed.

Cage actually plays a character named Nick Cage, but the clips from his movies judiciously sprinkled throughout dispense with any doubts about who this is supposed to be, even if he's playing (hopefully) an exaggerated version of himself.

As for other cinematic touchstones, Cage states or is told more than once that he's a movie star, not an actor, echoing Peter O'Toole's swashbuckling star in ""My Favorite Year,"" which certainly qualifies as good company even if the film doesn't scale those heights.

Directed and co-written by Tom Gormican (who has one other feature to his credit), the film requires Cage to be an extremely good sport, introducing him as a nearly washed-up star missing what he keeps describing as the possible role of a lifetime. His ex-wife (Sharon Horgan) and teenage daughter (Lily Sheen) both do a lot of eye-rolling around him, speaking to past slights thanks to his actorly self-absorption.

Living out of a hotel and in need of cash, Cage grudgingly agrees to attend the birthday party of a wealthy superfan in Spain for a hefty payout, despite being miserable at the prospect. But said fan, Javi (Pascal), brings plenty of baggage to the situation as the known head of a crime cartel, with a pair of US government agents ( Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz , both underemployed) on his tail.

417,"'Under the Banner of Heaven' flies high, while 'Shining Girls' doesn't","(CNN) Two limited crime series with literary underpinnings yield very different verdicts, with ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" emerging as an engrossing fact-based drama set around the Mormon Church during the 1980s, while ""Shining Girls"" turns a time-traveling serial-killer plot into a vaguely incomprehensible thriller for Apple TV+.

Playing like a cross between ""True Detective"" and ""Big Love,"" ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" begins with the gruesome murder of a woman (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and her child, exposing the kind of dark secrets that small communities elevated to true-crime status invariably seem to contain.

Adapted from Jon Krakauer's book by Dustin Lance Black (""Milk""), the seven-episode series stars Andrew Garfield -- coming off ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" and his Oscar nod for ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" -- as Jeb Pyre, the detective who catches the case, which leaves widowed husband Allen Lafferty (Billy Howle) as the prime suspect. But the investigation finds more insidious roots that hint at a larger conspiracy, one that involves the sprawling Lafferty family's embrace of fundamentalist principles and the sordid practices related to them.

Pyre, meanwhile, is a family man and member of the church, whose faith is tested by the grim nature of the crime and defensive response from local officials. His situation is balanced by his grizzled partner (Gil Birmingham), an outsider more than willing to play bad cop if that is what's required.

The framing is a little flabby, as the flashbacks slowly putty in how the outspoken woman might have become a murder target. Nor does it help that the narrative flashes way back to the story of church founder Joseph Smith and those origins -- an element of the book that, as presented in this format, somewhat distracts from the more contemporary plot, as if the story has taken an abrupt detour into a History channel docudrama.

Still, the central mystery provides a powerful hook, and the material is elevated by an inordinately good cast, with Sam Worthington, Wyatt Russell and Rory Culkin as Allen's older siblings, with Allen chillingly saying, ""I couldn't hear the holy spirit in the same way my brothers could"" after telling Pyre, ""You might not be as good a Mormon as you think.""

""Under the Banner of Heaven"" isn't quite a great show, but it's a solidly good one, which is more than can be said for ""Shining Girls,"" which mostly squanders a cast headlined by Elisabeth Moss, who doubles as its producer.

Elisabeth Moss and Wagner Moura in 'Shining Girls,' premiering on Apple TV+.

Based on Lauren Beukes' novel, the project features Moss as Kirby, a newspaper archivist who survived a brutal attack but finds that her own reality keeps changing, as if the playing field is being reset. Her search for answers prompts her to team up with a reporter ( ""Narcos"" star Wagner Moura , underemployed), seeking to somehow connect a trail of victims scattered across decades.

Jamie Bell co-stars as the mysterious time-traveler, while Phillipa Soo (""Hamilton"") is another potential victim. Yet the explanation for this science-fiction-style spin on a serial-killer story is left rather vague despite the obligatory flashbacks -- it's unclear what the rules are -- not that those details make a whole lot of difference as the project kicks into thriller mode down the stretch.

Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material. While ""Shining Girls"" seems potentially intriguing at first glance, by the time one has watched to the end of its disappointing eight episodes its light is flickering, and for viewers, it'll be too late to hit the reset button.

""Under the Banner of Heaven"" premieres April 28 on Hulu.

418,'The Wire' merges with Baltimore policing's reality in 'We Own This City',"(CNN) If ""The Wire"" defined the futility of the drug war -- and not incidentally ranks as one of the greatest series ever made in the eyes of a loyal few -- its fictional look at policing Baltimore merges with a fact-based version in ""We Own This City,"" a spare but bleak window into a culture of corruption that plagued the city's police department.

""The Wire"" producer David Simon , again working with George Pelecanos, here adapts a book by Justin Fenton, a reporter at Simon's former stomping grounds the Baltimore Sun, detailing the abuses by Baltimore's Gun Trace Task Force , and how higher-ups looked the other way on malfeasance and complaints as long as arrest rates remained high.

Jumping back and forth in time, the six-episode series proves a little disorienting at first as it flits among various characters and stories, with the key touchstone being charges filed against Baltimore officers over Freddie Gray, who died in police custody in 2015. The Gray case brought federal scrutiny to the department's actions, with Wunmi Mosaku (""Loki"") playing Nicole Steele, an attorney with the Justice Dept.'s Civil Rights division investigating police corruption, working against a deadline knowing the Trump administration might not follow through on her efforts.

Other key figures include Jon Bernthal (""The Punisher"") as Sgt. Wayne Jenkins, a rogue officer whose exploits are documented through those aforementioned flashbacks; and Jamie Hector (""The Wire"") as Sean M. Suiter, a detective who begins to face uncomfortable questions regarding his past.

As with ""The Wire,"" ""We Own This City"" provides a granular look at the bureaucratic dysfunction that allowed certain cops to operate so brazenly, including the leverage wielded by officers over department and city officials concerned about their own careers and election prospects.

419,'They Call Me Magic' celebrates Magic Johnson's life on and off the court,"(CNN) It's a testament to Magic Johnson, the man, that basketball only accounts for about half of ""They Call Me Magic,"" a four-part Apple TV+ docuseries devoted to his life, including the rich chapters that followed his NBA stardom. Think of it as a more satisfying companion to HBO's ""Winning Time,"" or more focused alternative to ESPN's comprehensive Bulls chronicle ""The Last Dance.""

For basketball fans, those first two parts are certainly a heady dive into Earvin Johnson Jr.'s dazzling talent and incandescent personality, which earned him his nickname at an early age, with journalist Michael Wilbon drawing a distinction between Earvin, the guy, and Magic, ""a character that played basketball.""

Johnson's high-school heroics, national championship at Michigan State and NBA title as a rookie are all well documented, which might explain why director Rick Famuyiwa gives them their due but doesn't necessarily dwell on them. In his extensive interviews, Johnson admits to having been angry when Larry Bird won rookie of the year, while fellow Lakers recall their skepticism over Johnson's closeness to Lakers owner Jerry Buss.

""We were all wondering if Earvin was a player or management,"" teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar notes, after marveling that Johnson's no-look passes ""made it seem like he was clairvoyant.""

As the documentary notes, Johnson's golden aura was tested at times, from his failures against the Boston Celtics earning him the unwanted nickname ""Tragic"" to boos raining down on him after he was stamped with having triggered the firing of then-Lakers coach Paul Westhead.

420,'Gaslit' gets a spark from Julia Roberts as Watergate whistleblower Martha Mitchell,"(CNN) Setting a high bar for HBO's upcoming ""The White House Plumbers,"" ""Gaslit"" looks at Watergate from the perspectives of several key players, deriving its title from the horrid treatment of Martha Mitchell . Losing a bit of momentum down the stretch thanks in part to its diffused storylines and semi-satirical tone, it's still an extremely well-cast look at the presidential scandal that made the suffix ""gate"" part of our lexicon.

President Nixon notably remains an off-camera presence through most of the eight-episode series, which marks Starz's entry into the crowded realm of attention-grabbing historical dramas. The show comes with a glittering marquee, casting Julia Roberts and an unrecognizable Sean Penn (is there an Emmy for prosthetic jowls?) as Martha and John Mitchell, the latter the dutiful Nixon Attorney General who put loyalty to the president ahead of his wife.

The terrific ensemble also includes Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") as John Dean, portrayed as an ambitious young lawyer swept up in Nixon's campaign of dirty tricks, who finally asserts himself with help from his eventual wife Mo (""GLOW's"" Betty Gilpin); and Shea Whigham (""Boardwalk Empire"") as messianic soldier G. Gordon Liddy , introduced performing his famous stunt of holding his hand over a flame to demonstrate how tough he is.

It's Martha, dubbed ""the mouth of the South,"" who provides the project's title as well as its heart and soul, and gives Roberts a chance to essentially return to ""Steel Magnolias"" territory. Known for her cozy relationship with reporters, Mitchell was kidnapped, held and drugged to prevent her from talking when the scandal broke, after which Nixon's flunkies endeavored to make her look like a drunk and crazy woman (she's shown being asked if she's nuts on a talk show) in order to discredit her.

Directed by Matt Ross, working with producers Robbie Pickering and ""Mr. Robot's"" Sam Esmail (who previously teamed with Roberts on ""Homecoming"" ), ""Gaslit"" at times feels as if it has bitten off more than it can chew, narratively speaking, and the over-the-top aspects -- including the Keystone Cops nature of the break-in itself -- risk clashing with the darker side of the story.

Still, there are plenty of memorable moments amid the madness, such a John Mitchell telling a wide-eyed Dean, ""To defeat our enemy, we must become snakes,"" and Martha later snapping when her husband frets about her outspokenness, ""Get another wife if you want a silent one."" Plus, there are other deft touches, like the look that comes across the face of Mark Felt -- a.k.a. Deep Throat -- when his boss at the FBI, L. Patrick Gray (John Carroll Lynch), tries to bury the bureau's investigation.

The renewed interest in Watergate comes after the Trump years, and various scandals that have drawn comparisons to what Nixon aides at the time euphemistically described as ""simple intelligence gathering"" and, as Liddy puts it, acquiring ""opposition leverage.""

Adapted from the ""Slow Burn"" podcast, ""Gaslit"" evokes Watergate with all its messiness, reflecting how the president's men went from willing accomplices in these schemes to investigative targets, faced with the choice between cooperating or going down with the ship.

At its foundation, ""Gaslit"" presents not just the politics of the 1970s but its cultural mores, evident in the casual misogyny at work in dismissing Martha's claims as the ravings of a socialite wife. In doing so it captures a time when there were snakes all around, and how far they'd go to save their own skins.

""Gaslit"" premieres April 24 at 8 p.m. ET on Starz.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/entertainment/gaslit-review-julia-roberts-sean-penn/index.html
421,'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is the mind-bending metaverse movie you didn't know you needed,"(CNN) Strange, surreal and unexpectedly sentimental, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is genuinely and wildly original -- the kung fu/science fiction/metaphysical action comedy that you didn't know you needed, but just might love. ""Might"" does a lot of work there, because while the film will have its well-deserved admirers, the dizzying nature of it won't be for everyone.

On the plus, it would be hard to spoil a movie that moves at this sort of frenetic pace, and that works from the Marvel-esque conceit that there is a multiverse of infinite possibilities, with different universes created by the different choices that we make along the way.

All this comes as jarring news to Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), who is living a rather tedious, hectic life running a struggling laundromat, dealing with her upbeat but ineffectual husband (Ke Huy Quan, the kid from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" now grown up and returned to acting) and a grown daughter, Joy ( ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's"" Stephanie Hsu), who is understandably irked by mom's reluctance to acknowledge that she's gay.

Meeting with an IRS agent (Jamie Lee Curtis, buried under unflattering makeup), Evelyn is suddenly pulled into the multiverse, apprised that she's the one person who can stop an ""agent of chaos"" that represents a threat to them all. Moreover, each time she accesses one of the other universes she acquires the skills that she developed there, which given the dangers and Yeoh's martial-arts background, certainly comes in handy.

Directed by the team of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (who go by Daniels), the film owes a sort-of debt to ""The Matrix,"" but that comparison doesn't come remotely close to capturing the whimsical tone, which can then become thoughtful and melancholy. This isn't the kind of movie one would necessarily seek out for a deep contemplation of roads not taken, ""dreams you never followed"" and achieving serenity with one's choices, but that's certainly one of the universes that ""Everything Everywhere"" occupies.

430,Moderna seeks emergency use authorization for Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months through 5 years,"(CNN) Moderna is seeking emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for its Covid-19 vaccine for children 6 months through 5 years of age, the company said Thursday.

""We believe mRNA-1273 will be able to safely protect these children against SARS-CoV-2, which is so important in our continued fight against COVID-19, and will be especially welcomed by parents and caregivers,"" Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a news release.

No Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized for children younger than 5 in the US -- about 18 million people -- and a timeline to potential authorization is not yet clear. Moderna officials have said the FDA is expected to move fast, and a Pfizer official suggested its vaccine for younger children could be available in June, if its authorized.

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, this week called vaccines for younger children ""one of our highest priorities,"" but acknowledged the agency needed complete applications from vaccine manufacturers in order to finish its review.

The FDA will ask its independent vaccine advisers to weigh in on vaccines for younger children, too, and Marks said the agency would release a timeline for advisory committee meetings in the next week.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/health/moderna-vaccine-eua-young-children/index.html
431,"The US is in 'transition phase' of pandemic, Fauci says","(CNN) The United States is ""certainly, right now, in this country, out of the pandemic phase,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on PBS's ""NewsHour"" on Tuesday.

""Namely, we don't have 900,000 new infections a day and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. We are at a low level right now. So if you're saying, are we out of the pandemic phase in this country? We are,"" he said.

On Wednesday, Fauci told CNN that his comments had been mischaracterized by some to mean that the pandemic is over, ""which is not what I said.""

""We're not over the pandemic. Don't let anybody get the misinterpretation that the pandemic is over, but what we are in is a different phase of the pandemic,"" he said. ""A phase that's a transition phase, hopefully headed toward more of a control where you can actually get back to some form of normality without total disruption of society, economically, socially, school-wise, etc.""

Fauci noted that, in fact, Covid-19 cases are trending up again, though it's not anywhere near the rise we saw over the winter with the Omicron wave.

432,"Nearly 60% of Americans now have antibodies from Covid-19 infection, CDC study finds","(CNN) Nearly 60% of adults and 75% of children have antibodies indicating that they've been infected with Covid-19, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The data come from an ongoing study of blood samples sent to commercial laboratories across the US.

At the beginning of December, an estimated 34% of Americans had antibodies showing that they had once been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19. By the end of February, after an avalanche of cases caused by the Omicron variant, that number had jumped to 58%.

""The highest jump in antibody detection was among children and adolescents,"" said Dr. Kristie Clarke, a pediatrician who led the study for the CDC.

By February, roughly 75%, or 3 in 4 children under the age of 18, had developed antibodies to Covid-19, according to the study. The lowest increase was among adults 65 and older; the CDC estimates that 33% of seniors have been infected with Covid-19.

433,Pfizer requests FDA authorization for Covid-19 booster for kids 5 through 11,"(CNN) Pfizer and BioNTech said Tuesday that they have submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine for children 5 through 11.

The companies have said that a third vaccine dose raised Omicron-fighting antibodies by 36 times in this age group.

In an analysis of 140 children with no evidence of prior Covid-19 infection, antibody levels against the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were six times higher one month after a booster dose than a month after the second vaccine dose.

Studies from the New York State Department of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 5 to 12 dropped substantially during the Omicron surge, falling from 68% to about 12% against Covid-19 infection. However, two doses continued to provide protection against more severe illness resulting in urgent care or hospitalizations.

More than 10,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years are enrolled in Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trials at study sites around the world. The companies expect to submit data from these trials focused on children younger than 5 in the coming months. That age group is the only one for which a Covid-19 vaccine has not been authorized in the US.

434,"In new book, Birx describes how data failures, bureaucracy and politics hindered Covid-19 response","(CNN) Issues with data collection and testing, slow communication and interpersonal conflicts within the Trump administration hurt the initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, former White House Coronavirus Response Task Force Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx says in her new book, published Tuesday.

Throughout the book, ""Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It's Too Late,"" Birx speaks to her struggle to get through to an administration unprepared for the pandemic and President Trump, who quickly chilled on her stark projections of the damage the virus could do.

""Any other president would have wanted to know just how bad things were going to get and what could be done to prevent the worst case,"" Birx wrote of her early days on the task force in 2020. ""Except, this wasn't any other president or any other White House. This was President Trump and the Trump White House. I was standing on constantly shifting sand, among political players I didn't know and a president who apparently liked his news served good and upbeat, or not at all.""

Birx levies critiques too against the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its initial reaction to the illness as flu-like and lack of clear division of duties among agencies. Birx attributed some of this to CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield's status as a ""political appointee"" in the Trump administration.

""The rank and file would question everything that came from Bob and this White House,"" she said of her difficulties getting CDC officials on board with acknowledging broad asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus.

Still, as political messages drove out public health messages, Birx wrote, she and some of the doctors in the Covid-19 response formed a pact: If any were fired, Redfield, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn agreed they would all resign in protest.

""I was neither hoping to be fired nor willing to resign independent of the others being let go,"" she wrote.

""I didn't believe my departure would change anything for the better. Accusing the Trump administration of negligence wasn't going to suddenly produce a different response to the pandemic from them.""

The optics of firing her would be bad, she wrote.

After Birx told CNN's Dana Bash in August 2020 that the virus was ""extraordinarily widespread,"" Birx wrote, Trump called her and demanded the name of the person who booked the interview, saying ""That's it! Do you understand me? Never again! The virus is under control.""

Although they were making progress, she wrote, ""The president was wrong. We didn't have the virus under control.""

Aside from a ""dysfunctional"" White House, the United States struggled to keep pace with the fast-moving virus, Birx wrote. Fixing the problems uncovered by the Covid-19 pandemic may help save the country from the next, she says.

Address inadequate data collection and analysis

""Data is everything in a pandemic,"" Birx writes in the book. ""Data shows your gaps; it shows where communities have an effective response; it lays bare the truth, where things are deteriorating and where they are better. It allows you to stay laser-focused and develop evidence-based policies. Without comprehensive data, you won't have a comprehensive response.""

Before joining the Covid-19 response, Birx wrote, she thought US health officials were seeing data that she couldn't access. But once she arrived in March 2020, it became clear to Birx -- who had previously worked on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief -- that the country was ""dangerously behind the eight ball"" on data collection on the emerging coronavirus.

Birx described a meeting in March at which the task force received a single double-sided page of data that ""summarized case data and deaths by state.""

In 2020, she wrote, data in some states was often being sent by fax and then passed along to the CDC.

""How was this really happening? How in the world could we not have clear data at this point?"" she wondered.

All the US had, she said, was ""a static, partial thirty-thousand-foot awareness. I pressed the flats of my hands into my eyes and shook my head. I had expected something very different, but now I could see not only that the data-reporting structures that had taken years to build in Africa weren't present in the United States, but that we had days to get the same job done here.""

Understand that a new virus may behave differently

Birx wrote that even before she signed on to the White House team, she suspected that asymptomatic spread was contributing to the quick rise in Covid-19, although the evidence was slim.

""After years of experience seeing asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic cases being ignored in tabulations, anytime I read a number indicating a confirmed case, I multiply that by a factor of between three and ten,"" she said.

Early on at least, the focus was on those with symptoms, much like in the case of the flu.

But the virus that causes Covid-19 is very different.

That became clear when cases surged in New York City, a dramatic rise that ""couldn't be explained by symptomatic spread alone.""

""If there'd been any doubt before about the extent to which asymptomatic spread was a significant contributor to the rise in case numbers, the New York City numbers convinced the team that my estimate of at least 30-50 percent asymptomatic spread was likely accurate and possibly even conservative,"" Birx wrote. ""Even though the testing issues prevented us from having the quantity and type of data we needed, a preponderance of numerical evidence, the picture was crystal clear.

""For those of us in that tiny room, doubt had been replaced by a communal sense of dread,"" she said of the task force.

Develop tests early

Contributing to the lack of clear, granular data on Covid-19 and the misunderstanding of silent spread was a significant need for testing in the United States. The CDC's early test was flawed, putting the country weeks behind on testing, Birx wrote. Even then, public health labs weren't equipped to move fast and handle the volume the Covid-19 response would need.

Writing about a meeting with American Covid-19 testing manufacturers early in her tenure, Birx said that learning that the White House had dragged its feet on meeting with manufacturers, on top of limited tests and slow test processing, represented a ""worst-case scenario.""

""In later conversations, I asked one of the manufacturers critical to the production of high-throughput and point-of-care tests if anyone in the administration or from the CDC had called them in January and February 2020,"" she wrote.

""Their reply was that, in fact, it had been the other way around: the manufacturers were the ones calling the CDC to understand what it was doing and how they could help. The manufacturers were held at arm's length"" by the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services and its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. ""They were told their assistance wasn't needed,"" Birx wrote.

Later on, Trump's rhetoric on testing shifted -- he suggested that the United States had high case numbers because it tested so many people -- but Birx said the task force was working rapidly to expand it, spending billions on tests and supplies and implementing serial testing in nursing homes and universities.

""At no time did anyone tell us to stop this acceleration in testing. The president was a master at saying one thing to appease his base while his administration did another in support of combating the virus,"" she wrote.

Push for solutions before there's a problem

Birx's book concludes with a list of ""critical issues"" to address in the US around pandemic response and preparedness. It includes clarity on how responsibilities are divided between agencies, ramped-up testing and diagnosis, improvements to CDC data collection and ""overarching"" improvements for public health coordination.

Some of those changes are still needed to manage the current pandemic.

""One of the most important takeaways here is to not wait until the surge or the holidays are upon us,"" she wrote. ""We have learned that there are lulls in the outbreaks. During these interludes, we needed to expand testing access. We should have used that time to prepare for the next surge by getting as many Americans as possible to buy into making critical behavioral changes needed to protect their vulnerable family members.""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Looking ahead, Birx wrote that the solutions can't be pushed into place only when there's an emergency.

""We don't need one set of standards and processes for improving public health of the country and another for pandemic preparedness -- they need to be integrated and utilized between pandemics to improve the health of the nation,"" she wrote.

""We need to stop just observing the problem and begin addressing the problem.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/birx-covid-book-silent-invasion/index.html

Met Gala 2022: Best fashion from the red carpet

The Met Gala is fashion's big night out -- and celebrities are known for saving their most striking outfits for its often theatrical red carpet.

Pandemic-related rescheduling means it has been less than eight months since the stars last descended on the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the (normally) annual fundraiser, giving designers less time to think about the event's dress code : ""Gilded Glamour and White Tie."" The theme is expected to continue 2021's exploration of American style , in keeping with the Costume Institute's accompanying two-part exhibition, ""In America: An Anthology of Fashion.""

At the exhibition's press event before the gala, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden gave opening remarks at the Met, emphasizing American design's ""rich and deep"" history.

""It is a story of innovation and ingenuity, of rebellion and renewal,"" she said. ""It has often been written by those in the shadows, not recognized for their influence and art, but here at the Met their stories are told. Their voices are raised and their work can shine.""

Prior to Monday evening's red carpet, one of the quintessential American designers, Tommy Hilfiger , whose work features in the show, told CNN that the event offered designers a chance to ""showcase their unique interpretations of fashion and pop culture.

""I always look forward to seeing how designers interpret the theme with their own creativity, identity and twist, and I'm sure this year will be no exception,"" Hilfiger said via email. ""The Met Gala is all about having an open mind and thinking outside the box.""

For former Yeezy designer Maisie Schloss, who now runs her own LA-based label Maisie Wilen , said the fundraiser's combination of high fashion and mainstream appeal makes it a ""unique"" red carpet.

""The events embraced by industry insiders and the masses alike allow for peak creativity,"" she said via email, adding: ""I hope guests bring out their most decadent yet playful looks.""

436,Blake Lively transforms at the Met Gala in architecture-inspired Versace gown,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Blake Lively paid tribute to New York City architecture in a shimmering gown that dramatically transformed as she walked the Met Gala red carpet on Monday night.

Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds are co-hosts of the event, and while Reynolds wore a more classic tuxedo by Ralph Lauren for the theme ""Gilded Glamour and White Tie,"" Lively stunned in a custom Versace dress inspired by Art Deco design and the details of some of New York's most famous landmarks.

The evening's dress code was inspired by the Gilded Age , the 30-year period at the end of the 19th-century that saw skyrocketing wealth for industrialist families in the US and over-the-top fashion for New York City's upper crust.

When Lively first arrived, the glittering, beaded Versace dress was wrapped by an oversized coppery satin bow. But as she ascended the stairs to the entrance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, her bow was released to reveal the rest of the sweeping ensemble: A long skirt in an aged copper tone, paying tribute to the patina of the Statue of Liberty.

""I've patinated,"" Lively told LaLa Anthony during Vogue's live stream. ""This dress is an homage to New York City and so many of the classic, iconic buildings."" She showed off some of the dress's subtle references: ""This is detailing from the Empire State Building, some of the draping from the Statue of Liberty...(and) the constellation from Grand Central Station.""

Tiaras have shown to be the accessory of the night, and Lively was one of many who sported the accessory. Hers was an elegant band featuring seven spikes, another reference to Lady Liberty. Symbolizing the seven continents, the actor explained they represent ""inclusivity, welcomeness, and freedom."" She also requested from jewelry designer Lorraine Schwartz to feature 25 stones for the 25 windows of the iconic statues.

""'Who's actually going to be counting the stones?'"" she recalled Schwartz asking her. ""'Me, I'm a Virgo,'"" she replied with a laugh.

""This year was especially nervewracking being one of the hosts,"" she told Anthony. ""I thought a neat perspective on the theme would be looking at the city that I love so much and the architecture, rather than just the fashion.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/blake-lively-met-gala-2022-versace-dress/index.html

Quannah Chasinghorse is an Indigenous activist and land protector who has become a sought-after model over the past two years. All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author. The feature is part of CNN Style's series Hyphenated , which explores complex issues of identity.

Despite being into fashion since I was young, I never once thought that I could be a model. I am a proud member of the Hän Gwich'in and Sičangu/Oglala Lakota tribes in the US -- but like most Indigenous teenagers, I grew up without any representation in pop culture. I didn't feel confident or even like the way I looked.

When I was 14 years old, I received my first facial tattoo, a traditional hand poke tattoo called Yidįįłtoo, in a ceremony that was practiced to signify coming of age. It was truly a special moment. I could have done it sooner, but waited until I could better articulate its meaning and sacredness: why it's so important for us to reclaim this tradition after it -- like so many other cultural practices -- has been nearly erased. The other tattoos have each been a rite of passage. Not every Indigenous person's tattoos are the same; they each tell our personal histories.

I have always wanted to represent my people in the best way, and now I am fortunate enough to do so, by being on magazine covers and walking runways. Being someone who can shift how others see beauty is important, because I know a lot of girls who look like me and who can feel out of place.

It's really beautiful to be a part of a larger change in the fashion industry where people from all walks of life are increasingly represented. But my rule is, if you want to work with me, you have to work with all of me. I won't cut or change the color of my hair and I won't cover up my facial tattoos because they are part of my identity as an Indigenous person. When I first started out, I worried that these non-negotiables would prevent me from booking jobs, but instead I have found the opposite. Every person that I've worked with has been so accepting, understanding and graceful. I've been so blessed.

Honoring my indigeneity

Last September, I attended my first Met Gala, one of fashion's biggest nights. I wanted to debut the right way, especially knowing that the theme was a celebration of American fashion. I set out to be myself and honor my indigeneity, which I did by pairing a gold lamé dress designed by Peter Dundas with Native accessories.

The turquoise and silver jewelry actually belong to one of my aunties, who was named Miss Navajo Nation in 2006. I wore many of her beautiful silver and turquoise necklaces, earrings and bracelets.

My mom had to raise me and my brothers as a single parent, and my aunties were a big part of my upbringing and I often talk about my mom and the auntie squad and how much they mean to me. These strong matriarchs have shown me what true power looks like and how to utilize it in the best way possible.

I love how supportive Anna Wintour (who thought it was a brilliant idea to incorporate the pieces) and Peter were, knowing intuitively how much wearing Native jewelry on the red carpet would mean to me. I wore some of my auntie's pieces again during my shoot with Vogue Mexico, as well as ones made by local Alaskan artists.

My people have always felt invisible and so having this kind of visibility is so meaningful. Despite everything that Native communities have endured and lost, we are still here, and we are proud of who we are.

Finding my voice

From a very young age, my mom taught me about our connectedness to one another, to our community and to the land. As Indigenous people, we don't consider ourselves separate from or more important than nature. When you grow up with a connection to the land, it's natural that you want to defend it, because it is a part of you. I choose to walk the path I do because of those teachings, and today, I continue to try my best and do my part, spreading awareness to many issues within Native country, including climate justice, protecting sacred lands and waters, Indigenous sovereignty, and the movement MMIWG2S, which stands for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People and was formed to stop violence against Native women.

My mom and my aunties have traveled with me to several rallies and protests, where I have been given space to speak on some of these issues. They've come with me to Washington D.C., where I lobbied on behalf of my people to restore our sacred lands through the HR 1146 bill (which was passed on the floor of the House of Representatives last year but did not go further). Because of their constant encouragement, I have found my voice and I am discovering my own power.

Modeling has become another conduit for my advocacy work. It's become a platform for storytelling as well as spotlighting pressing issues. Because of that, it's important for me to work with designers and brands who also uphold the same values around climate justice and sustainability. I recently walked for designer Gabriela Hearst, who is sustainability-focused, and has collaborated with Indigenous people, credited them for their work and hired Native models to showcase the pieces. I've also partnered with the luxury outerwear brand Mackage, who made a beautiful sustainable and recycled collection and donated to a non-profit organization that supports Indigenous peoples all over the world.

These days, I get so many messages from young Indigenous women who are excited to see my recent fashion shoots in magazines. I can't even explain the type of feeling I get because it's such a powerful thing for our people to finally feel seen and heard, after such a long time without being represented in fashion. And this younger generation won't have to break the first barrier, instead they will be able to walk this path with me.

And while I do see more inclusivity in fashion when it comes to the race, size and gender, there's always room for improvement. At every show or shoot I'm part of, I meet the most beautiful people, and I'm not only talking about their appearance. So many rising models now have something special and unique about them that they bring -- they aren't just meant to wear clothes. Seeing these changes across the industry is heartening as it evolves into a better version of itself. But we have to keep holding each other accountable. I'm looking forward to watching it grow.

438,"As war rages in Ukraine, ballet dancers of the Lviv National Opera return to the stage","In the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, residents are trying to reclaim a sense of normalcy as fighting intensifies elsewhere in the country.

As war rages in Ukraine, ballet dancers return to the stage

With the audience waiting eagerly in its seats, a familiar message echoes through the hall, reminding patrons to turn off phones and immerse themselves in the experience.

It's immediately followed by a more abnormal announcement. ""Dear guest, our event will be suspended in case of air raid alert. Dancers and spectators must go to the bomb shelter situated in the theater,"" it tells the crowd -- a poignant reminder that this is not a regular night at the theater.

Then the lights dim, the orchestra begins to play, and a dancer appears on stage from the wings.

Lviv National Opera reopens in hopes art can help heal wounds of war

Lviv National Opera was forced to close its doors on February 24 when Russia launched an unprovoked and violent assault on Ukraine. It welcomed theater enthusiasts back for its first full production on Friday night.

""One way or another, the war affects us all,"" the opera's artistic director, Vasyl Vovkun, tells CNN. ""We understand that light must defeat darkness, that life must defeat death, and the mission of the theater is to assert this.""

The western Ukrainian city of Lviv has emerged almost entirely unscathed as heavy fighting has devastated cities elsewhere in the country. Thousands of fleeing civilians have transited through the hub city before journeying to neighboring Poland and beyond.

For those left in this resilient city, residents are slowly learning to live with the war. City center cafes and restaurants are again doing a bustling trade, the streets are once more teeming with foot traffic and residents have returned for casual strolls in the parks.

Providing a place of solace amid the raging conflict is the driving force behind resuming shows, Vovkun says.

To start, he's chosen a well-performed ballet classic, ""Giselle."" A ballet of two acts, it tells the tale of a beautiful peasant girl who dies prematurely after being betrayed by the man she loves.

The 64-year-old former minister of culture and tourism explains: ""Giselle also has all shades of joy and sadness, there is also death and there is also the victory of love. And in fact, this topic is consistent today. Even when we hear a lot about death, we still hope, both in this work and in life, that love will win, life will win.""

While his pick has proven popular -- with tickets selling out -- many of the seats remain empty.

""Despite the fact that we can only accept 300 people because we can only take that many in the shelter, it is still a great mission for us,"" Vovkun continues. ""To give people something to forget the news ... in this difficult time, because there is no good news in war. And for them to be spiritually resurrected during the war, looking at this piece of art.""

Putting on a good show is of the utmost importance to the theater's army of artists. Hours before the performance, production staff were triple checking lighting while others made sure every detail on set was perfect.

Within the bowels of the theater, costumers hustled up and down the stairs, tutus in hand. Meanwhile dancers shuffled along the corridors, their precious feet in protective slippers.

From one of the practice rooms, a bass voice reverberated up the narrow staircase to the rehearsal rooms on the top floor. In another part of the building, ballerinas sat quietly as stylists teased their hair before smoothing and pinning tightly in to place.

Maria Malanchyn, 68, has worked as a make-up artist at the cultural institution for five decades. She tells CNN the opera house is needed now more than ever.

""In my opinion, culture is obligatory, always, more so now,"" she explains. ""Now we have a lot of displaced people, it's very difficult for them. But we show them that life can go on.""

Daryna Kirik, 21, plays the lead role of ""Giselle."" Like many in the country, her life has been upended by the war and the horrors of Bucha , where mass graves were recently found.

""Dancing helps to distract from what's happening,"" the soloist says. ""Most of my relatives are in Kyiv and Kyiv region now. My mom and my grandmother and her sister survived occupation in Bucha. My mother managed to evacuate herself and the pets. Now she is in safety in Poland restoring her nerves.""

For Kirik, returning to the stage has given her a renewed sense of purpose and an opportunity to express her feelings through her craft.

She says what she likes most about playing Giselle is the ""opportunity to express emotions in the madness scene. All the negative emotions which are being accumulated for a long time can flow out together with those emotions of the character.""

And for a few hours, the audience is transported away from the chaos of reality. The crowd is captivated with every leap, lift and arabesque.

It is only a two-hour show but it appears to have achieved its goal to lift the spirits of those in attendance.

""After you visit this place, you understand that life can't be defeated. Our life can't be bombed, or destroyed by missiles or chemical or nuclear weapons,"" says Victoria Palamarchuk, a 50-year-old journalist, currently staying with extended family in Lviv after leaving her home in the central Zhytomyr region.

With a warm smile, she adds: ""Life can't be defeated while such places exist -- theaters, opera, and ballet theaters -- while people are coming here and feel joy with these sounds.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/lviv-national-opera-first-full-performance-intl-cmd/index.html
439,The Met Gala accessory of the night,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN Contributors Nick Remsen, CNN

With a dress code honoring America's Gilded Age, the Met Gala's guests looked to the past for inspiration. And there was one accessory that stole the show Monday night: the vintage tiara.

Actress Tommy Dorfman and YouTuber Emma Chamberlain were among the celebrities sporting generations-old crowns. However, it was the editors of Vogue magazine -- organizer of the glamorous annual fundraiser -- who led by example.

The evening's host, Anna Wintour , swapped her signature sunglasses for a glittering tiara. Speaking to reporters on the red carpet , Vogue's longtime editor-in-chief revealed that the jewel-encrusted item was a family heirloom dating back to around 1910.

The magazine's global editor-at-large, Hamish Bowles, meanwhile opted for a gold feather tiara, lending some sparkle to his white-tie outfit. In an Instagram post he revealed that it was designed by Fulco di Verdura, an Italian duke and jeweler who worked with Chanel in the 1920s and '30s.

Bowles explained that it had been designed for philanthropist Betsey Whitney to wear to a ball at London's Buckingham Palace in 1957 -- and it has not been worn in public since, he added.

""I saw it (at) chez Verdura a decade or more ago, fell in love with it and never thought that one day I would have my Eliza Doolittle moment wearing it,"" he explained in the caption.

The theme spanned generations, with Chamberlain sporting a tiara made by Cartier in 1911 -- nine decades before she was born. She completed the look with a Louis Vuitton crop top and floor-length white shirt.

Elsewhere, Dorfman accessorized her daring Christopher Kane cut-out dress with a bag reading ""Protect Trans Kids"" and an elegant vintage tiara. She told People magazine that her crown was ""almost 200 years old, which is pretty sensational.""

There was plenty of other headwear on display, with hats and fascinators seen throughout the evening. Among the most dramatic was model Winnie Harlow's headpiece, designed Iris Van Herpen. Sarah Jessica Parker meanwhile enlisted master milliner Philip Treacy for her towering feathered design.

One of the night's co-hosts, Blake Lively, took a more contemporary approach in a tiara custom-designed by jeweler Lorraine Schwartz.

Honoring the architecture of the Gilded Age in New York City, the star's outfit nodded to the Statue of Liberty, with the crown's 7 spikes -- like Lady Liberty's -- symbolizing the seven continents. Lively also asked Schwartz to feature 25 stones to represent the iconic statue's 25 windows.

""'Who's actually going to be counting the stones?'"" she recalled Schwartz asking her. ""'Me,"" she replied with a laugh. ""I'm a Virgo.""

440,Rarely seen photos from the Met Gala show celebrities letting loose,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

The Met Gala, known as fashion's biggest night, returns to its typical slot -- the first Monday of May -- after two years of disruptions due to the pandemic. The event, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City coincides with the opening of part two of the exhibition, ""In America: An Anthology of Fashion,"" hosted by the museum's Costume Institute. Guests have been asked to dress in ""Gilded Glamour and White Tie,"" referencing the lavish Gilded Age, a three-decade period at the end of the 19th century that transformed American infrastructure and society life.

photographers have largely been limited to snapping attendees' highly posed entrances; and the images that come from the tightly controlled press area are polished and repetitive. To see celebrities letting loose (the likes of Bella Hadid and Marc Jacobs But documentation of the splashy gala has changed in recent years, asphotographers have largely been limited to snapping attendees' highly posed entrances; and the images that come from the tightly controlled press area are polished and repetitive. To see celebrities letting loose (the likes of Bella Hadid and Marc Jacobs gathering in the bathroom for smoking breaks, for example) you'd have to turn to after-party photos or their Instagram feeds.

Images from the galas of yesteryear are enticing because of their nostalgia factor and retro styling, but they also reveal a more relaxed atmosphere not limited to red carpet arrivals.

Photographer Rose Hartman, who photographed the gala for decades until the early 2000s, recalled over the phone a time when there was more freedom to move around and engage with attendees. In 1986, she photographed actress Lynda Carter and socialite Blaine Trump mid-laugh.

""They were just so happily speaking to one another rather than posing,"" Hartman told CNN in 2020. ""I always try whenever possible to capture people who are engaged with one another.""

Photographer Ron Galella, who has photographed the gala since 1967 had a system in place to grab the best shots, from arrivals at coat check to the museum floor and dinner. ""It was easy to shoot inside,"" he wrote via e-mail in 2020. ""A New York Press card was all you needed to gain entry."" (When press passes eventually became limited, there were years he smuggled himself in through the employee entrance.)

Over the decades, since the event's first iteration in 1948, the gala has transformed from a swanky fete at off-site locations like Manhattan's Rainbow Room into a spectacle of fashion. Socialites and artists have ceded the spotlight to A-list celebrities, who make headlines for how they choose to interpret, or flout, the theme of the night.

The theme is based on the Costume Institute's new exhibition, such as this year's two-part show honoring American designers. Other themes have included 2019's ""Camp: Notes on Fashion"" and 2018's ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.""

The shift in guest list and atmosphere was largely due to a generational change in vision. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the crème de la crème of the fashion world and New York society, but her successor, Anna Wintour, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, using $30,000 tickets to the event to raise millions of dollars each year.

In 1999, Wintour's first year as chair of the event, Hartman snapped a photograph of the Vogue editor-in-chief walking in with former editor-at-large André Leon Talley, who passed away earlier this year. The image of them is joyful, with both editors resplendent in costume and caught in motion.

""I love the fact that they are walking rather than standing,"" Hartman said. ""I love the gesture of their movement.""

Galella's vast archive of Met Gala images, which he published in a book in 2019, also shows the endearing gestures between celebrities when they don't anticipate the flash of a camera. In 1983, he photographed supermodel Iman and designer Paloma Picasso laughing as Picasso's husband bent low to embrace the statuesque Iman by her waist. In 1995, he caught Christy Turlington seemingly teasing Kate Moss, slipping a finger into the dangerously low-cut back of Moss's white gown.

441,Met Gala 2022: Everything you need to know about the 'Gilded Glamour' theme,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo

When celebrities take to the Met Gala red carpet on May 2, there will likely be no shortage of corset boning and bustles.

That's because the dress code for this year's event, hosted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, is ""Gilded Glamour and White Tie,"" referencing the lavish era of American fashion in the last decades of the 19th century, when industrialization rapidly amplified the country's wealth gap.

This Met Gala accompanies the second part of the Costume Institute's exhibition "" In America: An Anthology of Fashion ,"" which opened last September and guided the previous event's attire. And while there's seemingly always a degree of flexibility when A-list attendees interpret the theme (""What's more American than a T-shirt head-to-toe?!"" said Kim Kardashian, after she took to the red carpet in an all-black spectral Balenciaga look), this prompt will give guests the chance to indulge their most decadent aspirations.

""It is very embellished, very exaggerated, very structured,"" fashion historian and curator Kate Strasdin said of Gilded Age style in a video interview. ""It feels so upholstered compared to the way that we think about dress now.""

The Gilded Age was a 30-year period during which industrialists and real estate magnates saw their fortunes ascend to staggering heights thanks to the rapid expansion of trains, factories, and urban centers. Famous family names including Frick, Astor, Carnegie, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt shaped the country's infrastructure, and the socialites of the era, including Caroline Schermerhorn Astor and Alva Vanderbilt, ruled New York society.

For the elite, fashion became maximal, with lace and crystal trimmings and even bird wings -- milliners in the era used so many feathers, wings and stuffed dead birds in their hats that it caused the formation of the Audubon Society, for the protection of birds, in 1895, according to the organization. Under their derriere-enhancing gowns, American women wore complicated undergarments, including corsets, stuffed shoulder cushions, bustle pads, crinolines (a form of structured petticoat), and even steel springs to achieve the right shape, though the silhouettes were simplified by the end of the century. Menswear was highly formal too, with the newly popular tuxedo in the 1880s becoming standard dress for high-flying gentlemen.

With a focus on American designers at the gala, some of them will no doubt rise to the grandeur of the challenge, like Moschino's Jeremy Scott, whose opulent takes on historical references have included sending 18th-century-inspired panniers down the runway. Celebrities may also call upon Christian Siriano or Pyer Moss for their over-the-top, highly structural couture pieces, or look back to vintage Alexander McQueen designs from across the pond that employed nod to the era, like caged crinolines. Corsets have already infiltrated the red carpet lately, with Olivia Rodrigo, Doja Cat and Dua Lipa all sporting them at the Grammys last month.

Status symbols

During the Gilded Age, you were what you wore, as Strasdin noted it was the period when branding from fashion houses was a novel concept. Many American women at the time bought their status-securing dresses from Paris from the pioneers of haute couture: Charles Worth, Jacques Doucet, Paul Poiret and Madame Jeanne Paquin, the latter of whom showed her innovative modern designs at the 1900s World Fair.

According to Strasdin, American dressmakers wouldn't have their moment until World War I disrupted the supply of European goods to the US.

""American women are having to actually travel there, so that's the first sign of enormous wealth -- to actually get yourself there for the fittings,"" she said. ""So then it became like Instagram influencers now -- (the women would) come back with dresses that people knew they'd bought in Paris.""

At a time when ""old money"" scoffed at ""nouveau money,"" like the Vanderbilts' newly amassed railroad fortune, it was important to be well connected with European culture. When Alva Vanderbilt, hoping to be accepted into the top rungs of society, threw a 19th-century rager for her newly completed midtown mansion, dubbed the Petit Chateau, photographs show she wore an elaborate Venetian-style gown meant to mimic Renaissance-era fashions. Meanwhile, her sister-in-law, Alice, wore a showstopping gown known as the "" electric light "" dress from Charles Worth's salon House of Worth. She paired the look with a handheld torch which she raised above her head in a posed picture to resemble the Statue of Liberty.

""The gown itself (had) all sorts of embellishments that were designed to catch the light,"" Strasdin said. ""And then she had an electric torch that was really cutting edge at the time. It's gone down in history as one of the iconic garments of the period.""

Corset wars

But even as the fashion pendulum swung towards formal and elaborate, the underground Aesthetic Movement began encouraging women to dispose of their corsets in the 1870s, kicking back against industrial-age societal conventions. Its female bohemian members donned loose-fitting ""artistic"" dresses in public that were considered shocking for their association with undergarments. (The male Aesthetes, like Oscar Wilde, were also looked down upon for their so-called feminized sartorial statements.)

Though the movement didn't change public dress codes widely for women, the silhouettes did somewhat catch on in the private homes of wealthy women. Enter the romantic leisurewear staple the ""tea gown"" -- an elaborate precursor to 2020's viral ""nap dress"" -- though, according to Strasdin, many tea gowns still hid ""a robust boned bodice"" underneath the fabric. Several of such gowns from Adelaide Frick, the wife of industrialist and art collector Henry Clay Frick, reside at The Frick in Pittsburgh, which houses a number of Gilded Age designs.

The era's rich sartorial history already earned some attention earlier this year through the series ""The Gilded Age,"" which debuted this past January on HBO (which is owned by CNN's parent company Warner Bros. Discovery). The show follows two young women who become entangled in New York society life, navigating the changing landscape of old money and new. The show's lead costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone, who outfitted actors Cynthia Nixon, Louisa Jacobson, Denée Benton and Carrie Coon according to their different social backgrounds and aspirations, told Variety in January her team was ""lucky"" to bring the era to the screen.

""It's very much a period that gives us a lot to experiment with, and lots to draw from and lots to play,"" she said.

This year's Met Gala attendees may not replicate the exact styles from a century and a half ago, but Strasdin finds the theme appropriate for its resonances today, including the impact of wealthy socialites (who make their fortunes off internet clout rather than steel factories) to the modernization of fashion houses.

""It'll be great to see a nod to all the embellishment...and a celebration of that kind of exaggeration,"" she said. ""And the whole exuberance of color and shape.""

""And maybe some crazy hats.""

442,"Venice Biennale: Against all odds, a Ukrainian artist and his curators bring 'Fountain of Exhaustion' to Venice","As Russia continues to attack Ukraine, Pavlo Makov's work for the Venice Biennale carries with it a powerful message of determination and resilience.

On the evening of February 24, just hours after Russia launched its full-blown attack on Ukraine, art curator Maria Lanko got into her car and left her home in Kyiv. Unsure of her exact plan, and with a potentially dangerous journey ahead, she packed only a few personal items into her trunk along with 78 bronze funnels belonging to one of the country's most important living artists, Pavlo Makov. Her mission was to drive them out of the country to safety.

Last summer, 63-year-old Makov and his team of curators -- including Lanko -- had won a bid to represent Ukraine at the Venice Biennale, a prestigious international event known as the ""Olympics"" of the art world. The funnels were crucial parts of their proposed entry, a water fountain sculpture called the ""Fountain of Exhaustion.""

The artwork was first conceived in Kharkiv, a city in northeast Ukraine, where Makov has lived and worked for over three decades. It was the mid-'90s, and the post-Soviet country was still undergoing a period of transition after its people voted for independence in a 1991 referendum. The fountain was intended to be a metaphor for the social and political exhaustion Makov witnessed as his country grappled with the civic and economic challenges of rebuilding an independent state. Constant water shortages in the city also inspired him to view the project from an ecological perspective as he ruminated on the idea that resources are finite.

Over the years, ""Fountain of Exhaustion"" took many forms, from sketches and prints to technical drawings and physical installations. The version planned for Venice was to be the first fully functioning fountain, with the 78 funnels mounted in such a way that the initial stream of water divides again and again as it makes its way down the triangular arrangement, its flow weakening until it reaches the bottom.

The week before Russia invaded Ukraine, Makov and his team ran a test on the newly constructed fountain to ensure the water flowed properly. Thanks to design and technical assistance from Forma (ФОРМА), a Kyiv-based architectural practice, the installation worked. The team was elated.

Soon after that, everything changed. While the threat of conflict had been building, giving the team time to consider contingency plans, the sudden attack on Ukraine made the possibility of unveiling the installation in Venice, then less than two months away, seem impossible.

The journey from Ukraine to Italy

Personal safety was the team's priority in the conflict's early days, as they scrambled together escape and shelter plans with family and friends. One of Lanko's co-curators, Lizaveta German, was heavily pregnant and living in an apartment in Kyiv when the war began. Just days away from her due date when the first missiles were launched, German wanted to stay in the city to be close to her maternity ward. But as the situation worsened, she and her husband made the difficult decision to move west to Ukraine's cultural capital Lviv, a city that was under less immediate threat. There, she was joined by the project's third co-curator, Borys Filonenko.

Lanko, meanwhile, was still driving. After six days on the road, the 78 funnels crammed into three boxes, she crossed the border into Romania. Later, exhausted from the near-constant travel, she made a rest stop in Budapest, Hungary, before eventually ending up in Austria's capital, Vienna.

There she waited for Makov, who was working on his own evacuation plan. He had been in Kharkiv when the war began, gathering his family in his apartment for the first two days. But the city was under such heavy bombardment that they were forced into a bomb shelter for nearly a week, and as the situation worsened, the artist decided to flee, driving out of the city with his 92-year-old mother, his wife and two other women.

German gave birth to a baby boy on March 16 in Lviv. Speaking to CNN in a hotel in the city ten days later, she reflected on art's role in times of extreme crisis. ""I do believe that art has this symbolic potential to celebrate people's lives and to show that we are still here -- to show that Ukraine isn't just a war victim,"" she said.

By that point, Lanko had made it to Italy. She found a production company in Milan that agreed to re-create the parts of the installation she had left behind in Ukraine.

Suddenly, it seemed that -- against all odds -- they would make it to Venice. There was also a growing sense among the team members that they should act as ambassadors for their country. As their fellow Ukrainians fought Russia on the front lines, served in hospitals and took volunteer roles, Makov and his team were beginning to mount a different kind of defense against the invasion.

""Ukrainian art has been overshadowed for a very long time by Russia,"" said German, holding her baby close to her chest. ""The cultural field has to be a battlefield as well, and we have to fight.""

Weeks later, Lanko, Filonenko, Makov and German (with her infant) were eventually reunited in Venice to complete final preparations together.

Attention 'paid by blood'

Speaking on Monday, two days before the project's press unveiling, Makov said he did not think of himself as an artist but rather a citizen of Ukraine whose duty it is to represent his country.

""I realized that it would be important for Ukraine to be represented (at the Biennale).""

With an influx of interest from media and the art world, the sculpture, once a broad reflection on how the world has exhausted itself, had taken on a new meaning. It had, by default, become a piece of ""war art"" -- and being in the spotlight has proved difficult for the team. ""It's a little bit paid by blood,"" said Lanko.

""We embrace all the attention because we understand that we're the 'speakers' at the moment -- the ambassadors of our country and of our culture,"" she continued, explaining that she hopes the conversation surrounding the pavilion can address Ukrainian art more generally.

As it turns out, Makov was not the only Ukrainian artist whose work was on show during the Venice Biennale's opening week. A solitary work by the late Maria Prymachenko hangs subtly near the entrance of the main pavilion, in the festival's Giardini area -- a quiet tribute to one of the country's most esteemed 20th century artists, whose name made headlines last month when a museum containing more than a dozen of her works was attacked by Russian forces. It's feared that not all of the art was salvaged from the blaze.

A message from the President

Further afield, in a building about 30 minutes walk from the main Biennale site, there also stands a exhibition of work made by Ukrainian artists over the last few weeks. It's a powerful reminder of the many creative people who have been impacted by the war, and another example of the determination and resilience of Ukrainian artists.

One such artist, Lesia Khomenko, is showing a series of large-scale portraits called ""Max in the army,"" which she named after one of her subjects: her husband, Max, who joined the military resistance. Another work, ""Difficulties of Profanation II"" by Nikkita Kadan, sees large pieces of shrapnel and rubble -- collected from Donbas in 2015 during the last Russian attack on Ukraine, and then from Kyiv in 2022 -- hanging from a frame.

Speaking via video at the exhibition's opening event, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said, ""Art can tell the world things that cannot be shared otherwise,"" as he urged the audience to support his country with art, words and their ""influence.""

The exhibition's curator, Björn Geldhof, orchestrated the show in just four weeks. During a walk-through of the space, he said: ""Creating in war time is not easy. But that's one of the things we wanted to do is show the incredible resilience that Ukrainian contemporary artists have.""

This strength of character was on full display at the Ukraine pavilion on its opening day. A press conference to mark the unveiling began with a moment of silence for the people in Ukraine. And while media and visitors continued to voice suggestions that the team behind the installation are heroes, Makov and his curators batted away platitudes by reminding people that the real heroes are those on the battlefield, in the hospitals and in areas under siege.

The team was also measured in its assessment of art's ability to end conflict. ""I'm always saying that art is more diagnosis than a medicine,"" said Makov. ""I'm not quite sure it can save the world, you know? But it can help to save the world.""

Speaking weeks before, Lanko had expressed similar views: ""Art won't stop the war right now, but it might stop the next one,"" she said.

For German, the ""Fountain of Exhaustion"" is not a symbol of optimism, but she believes the fact they got it to Venice at all will ""give hope"" and show that Ukraine is capable of forging ahead in the darkest of times.

443,The Somali-French art dealer bringing Black perspectives to Paris' gallery scene,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

The CNN Originals series "" Nomad with Carlton McCoy "" debuts May 1 at 10pm ET/PT. The first episode, filmed in Paris, will include Mariane Ibrahim.

When Mariane Ibrahim opened her elegant, new three-story art gallery in Paris last September, she became the first Black gallerist to set up shop in the French capital, and, according to the Somali-French art dealer, the first dedicated to showing contemporary art from Africa and its diaspora.

Located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, among other noted galleries and close to landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre, the space has featured the otherworldly mixed-media figures of Haitian American artist M. Florine Démosthène and found-image collages by Afro Latino artist Clotilde Jiménez. In April, Ibrahim debuted the European show of Ghanaian painter Amoako Boafo , who captures the beauty of Black skin in swirling, lush brushstrokes.

The gallery's setting, in a crisp, airy new space, housed inside a historical building designed in classic Haussmann style, was particularly meaningful to her to underscore the importance of the lesser-seen work. ""It commands a certain contemplation, when you come in,"" she said in a phone interview. ""I really intended to have a space that is prestigious, that is able to host the art of the future.""

Before her homecoming to Paris, Ibrahim has spent the past decade building her US presence through eponymous galleries in Seattle and Chicago, with a focus on African diasporic art. Over the past few years, American museums and galleries have made significant strides in representing Black artists, she said, while art market interest has surged as well. But in Paris, despite France's extensive colonial history with the continent, there are no other galleries dedicated to artists of African heritage.

""It's troubling, because we are in 2022, (in) France, a country with such a strong connection to the world in general, but (especially) to Africa, and the Indies, the Caribbean,"" she said. ""There are more African artists who have received museum attention...in the US in the past five years than there has ever been in France in the past 50 years.""

In the forthcoming CNN Originals show ""Nomad with Carlton McCoy,"" in which sommelier Carlton McCoy explores the lesser-seen side of famous cities and countries, Ibrahim joined him and artist Raphaël Barontini for a home-cooked meal in Barontini's studio in Saint-Denis, a suburb, or ""banlieue"" of Paris. McCoy said in the episode that he had noticed ""a distinct lack of Black and Brown perspectives"" in the capital's famed museums.

""In France you're exposed to art, but you're exposed to the domination of a culture over others,"" Ibrahim told him in the episode. ""What you are seeing are works of them by them about people like us.""

Mariane Ibrahim, Carlton McCoy and Raphaël Barontini on ""Nomad.""

Ibrahim began collecting Barontini's work in 2019, drawn to the personal connection she felt to his work. Barontini is French, Italian and Caribbean, and Ibrahim felt a kinship to the ""hybridity"" of his practice, in which he silkscreens heroic African figures into regal compositions redolent of art historical European paintings.

""Constantly people are asking you to choose: What are you? Are you French, are you African?"" Ibrahim said. ""I refuse to do that. I don't want to choose. I want to be everything.""

Though Ibrahim is a pioneer in bringing contemporary African diasporic art to Paris, she believes that others will soon follow.

Paris has ""the right audience,"" she noted. ""That's why I'm very, very optimistic about France. I do think Paris is going to be the capital of diversity.""

Here, we asked Ibrahim to share five works of art that stayed with her.

Mariane Ibrahim's most impactful artworks

Seydou Ke​​ïta ""Untitled"" (1958-59)

When Ibrahim spotted a poster in a Parisian bar promoting an exhibition that featured the work of 20th-century photographer Seydou Keïta, who ran a portrait studio in Bamako, Mali, as the city transformed after colonial rule, it set her on her track to becoming a gallerist. The portrait featured, against a patterned backdrop, a man in a polished white suit and thick-rimmed glasses delicately presenting a single flower to the viewer.

""The poster, the flower, the look reminded me of my family photographs,"" she said. ""It just put me back into something that I was very familiar with. I was seeing my uncle, or my father's friend holding this flower.""

Influenced by Keïta, Ibrahim's first ever gallery show in Seattle featured the work of his peer Malick Sidibé. She reflected: ""That image affected me to a point to want to start a gallery.""

Tamara de Lempicka ""Young Lady with Gloves"" (1930)

This sumptuous, highly stylized painting by Polish Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka is one of Ibrahim's favorites because it relishes in the simple pleasure of beauty. The pictured woman peers out from beneath a white wide-brimmed hat with matching gloves, resplendent in a jewel-toned green dress and a bright red lip. ""I know the art world gave up on beauty in the 60s...with minimalism,"" she commented. ""I love maximalism.""

De Lempicka was also a rare female perspective in figurative painting, and Ibrahim appreciates the clarity of her gaze. ""I am haunted by this image of the drapery and this woman in the green dress,"" she said. ""Everything is charged...It's overcharged.""

Arthur Jafa ""Love is the message, the message is death."" (2016)

Set to Kanye West's gospel-infused track ""Ultralight Beam,"" this seven-and-a-half-minute video by artist and director Arthur Jafa is a tribute to the creative power of Black Americans amid violence and bigotry. Weaving together found video footage, Jafa creates a narrative of both collective elation and despair.

""Every single time I look at that video, it just gives me an energy that I can't explain -- an energy to destroy, and an energy to restore, to fix, to change,"" Ibrahim said. ""It just gives you something that brings joy and brings pain with the same intensity.""

Maimouna Guerressi, ""Surprise"" (2010)

The photographs of Italian Senegalese multimedia artist Maimouna Guerressi, who will be exhibiting at Ibrahim's Chicago location later this year, are tinged with mystery, influenced by Islamic mysticism.

As a woman born in Europe who converted to Islam, Guerressi assimilated to African traditions instead of the other way around. ""She's the opposite of me,"" Ibrahim said. ""She adopted another culture, changed her name, changed her religion...I found that really interesting and courageous.""

In ""Surprise,"" a levitating woman in dramatic but austere black and white garb gazes down at two young children in white robes, the image exudes a sense of holy reverence. Speaking to Guerressi's larger practice, Ibrahim said, ""This is someone who completely immersed herself in (African Muslim) culture and just created this extraordinary body of work.""

Gustave Courbet, ""L'Origine du Monde"" (1866)

Ibrahim was a teenager when she first encountered an image of French artist Gustave Courbet's cropped, close-up oil painting of a reclining woman's vulva, and she said she felt like she ""couldn't hide"" from the artwork. ""I've never seen any body displayed that way,"" she said.

After the painting was commissioned by an Ottoman diplomat, it was passed around private collectors, rediscovered in an antique shop, and looted during World War II before eventually being sold at auction to psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who kept it hidden behind a wooden sliding door. It has been on public display since 1995 at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where Ibrahim finally saw the work in person for the first time last year. She feels the work is indicative of the experience of viewing an artwork.

""Art is supposed to make you feel slightly uncomfortable,"" she said. ""But you keep looking for that again and again and again.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/mariane-ibrahim-paris-gallery-nomad/index.html
444,Powerful photo by Pacific Indigenous artist reveals truth about 1899 painting,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

On an early morning in 2008, before the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened for the day, the artist Yuki Kihara sat down across from two paintings by the French artist Paul Gauguin and inspected them in the hushed, empty gallery.

The Japanese and Samoan artist, who was exhibiting at the New York museum at the time, was particularly interested in ""Two Tahitian Women,"" from 1899, which features two feminine figures in an Eden-like setting. One holds a flower and leans into her companion, who presents a tray of fruit to the viewer, but doesn't quite look up to meet the eye. Fourteen years after first seeing it, Kihara has ""upcycled"" -- or reinterpreted -- the painting, along with many of Gauguin's other artworks, in a photography series titled ""Paradise Camp"" for the Venice Biennale.

""It's not like reenactment or restaging, because when I say 'upcycling,' it means that I'm actually improving it from the original,"" Kihara said in a video call.

Kihara is the first Pacific Indigenous artist from Samoa's Fa'afafine community -- who are assigned male at birth but express a female identity -- to represent New Zealand at the prestigious global art show. In ""Paradise Camp,"" curated by Natalie King, Kihara intertwines themes of LGBTQ+ rights, environmentalism, and decolonization. In her lush images, taken on Upolu Island in Samoa with a nearly 100-person cast and crew, she casts Fa'afafine in the starring roles, keeping the familiarity of Gauguin's compositions but shedding his exploitative perspective.

In modern art, Gauguin's colonial gaze of paradise has been formative. The painter, who died in 1903, spent a decade of his later life in French Polynesia exoticizing the young Indigenous women he encountered through a prolific number of canvases, and had predatory relationships with them as well -- a complicated legacy that was addressed in the exhibition "" Gauguin Portraits "" at the National Gallery in London in 2019. The teenage girls he painted included a 13-year-old named Teha'amana a Tahura, who experts believe to be his second wife, though her identity has been debated.

Uncovering and upcycling

How true are Gauguin's works and how much is constructed? To Kihara, the scenes, supposedly set in Tahiti, felt all too familiar.

""The closer I looked at the background, and then the closer I looked at the models, it reminded me of people and places in Samoa,"" she said.

Through her extensive research of colonial photography, Kihara has found a clear link to the archipelago -- specifically through the images of Thomas Andrew, a New Zealand photographer who lived in Samoa for the latter half of his life, from 1891 until 1939. Kihara discovered compositions identical to Gauguin's work, as well as evidence that Gauguin in 1895 visited the Auckland Art Gallery, where some of Andrew's images were housed.

""Although Gauguin has never actually set foot in Samoa, some of his major paintings were actually directly inspired by photographs of people and places (there),"" she said.

Kihara also believes that Gauguin's models may not be cisgender women, referencing the research of Māori scholar Dr. Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, who has written that the ""androgynous"" models he painted were likely Māhū -- the Indigenous Polynesian community that, like Samoa's Faʻafafine, are considered to be a third gender and express a female identity.

With these connections in mind, Kihara set out to improve upon Gauguin's famous works from a Pacific perspective. In her take on the painting ""Two Tahitian Women,"" called ""Two Fa'afafine (After Gauguin),"" the two Faʻafafine models stand in front of the manicured gardens of a local resort wearing traditional textiles. Kihara chose to feature local wildflowers and a plate of rambutan as their props, creating an altogether new iconography.

According to Kihara, her portrait challenges the very concept of paradise. ""The idea of paradise is actually heteronormative,"" she said, referencing the Bible's Garden of Eden, home to Adam and Eve. In famous literature and art, as well as commercial imagery of honeymooning newlyweds, ""paradise has been perpetuated by many people, including Paul Gauguin,"" she said. ""He comes from a canon of (the) Western gaze that impose this idea.""

Calling a place paradise also glosses over the complexities of the seemingly idyllic regions where tourists travel to escape, she added, including the land's history of colonial violence and the looming threat of climate disaster, a battle in which Samoa is on the front lines.

After the Biennale concludes, Kihara plans to exhibit the work for her own community in Samoa, New Zealand and Australia.

""I'm taking the integrity and the dignity back to where it belongs to us, in the Pacific,"" she said.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/yuki-kihara-paradise-camp-snap/index.html
445,India's latest box office smash 'The Kashmir Files' exposes deepening religious divides,"Rhea Mogul , CNN Written by Contributors Esha Mitra, CNN Manveena Suri, CNN

""If you don't leave from here, we will burn your houses,"" a bearded Muslim man in a traditional skullcap cries as he rallies against Kashmir's minority Hindus.

The packed mosque erupts in rapturous support of his disturbing call. ""Go away from here,"" continues the man. ""Convert, leave or die.""

This is a scene from Indian filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri's controversial new movie, ""The Kashmir Files,"" which is based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits -- members of Hinduism's highest caste, the Brahmin, or ""priestly class"" -- from the restive region as they fled violent Islamic militants in the 1990s.

Produced on a relatively small budget of around $3 million, it has become the highest-grossing Hindi film released in India during the pandemic, raking in more than $30 million since it hit theaters last month.

A large part of the film's success may be down to India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While India's government did not fund the production, the movie has been praised by several prominent politicians, with some BJP-ruled states waiving tax on tickets -- and others giving police officers and government workers time off to watch it.

Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- who has previously been criticized for failing to condemn violence against Muslims -- backed the movie. During a parliamentary meeting in New Delhi in March, he said there had been a ""campaign to discredit"" the movie before praising the filmmaker for ""showing the truth.""

Not everyone in India agrees. While there is little doubt that many Kashmiri Pandits suffered at the hands of Islamic militants, critics have questioned the timing of the film's release and argued that its graphic violence vilifies Muslims and reinforces negative stereotypes.

Some have also suggested such portrayals -- as well as the plot's alleged historical revisionism -- could exacerbate conflict between India's Hindus and Muslims at a time when religious tensions in the country are increasingly hostile.

Several videos that went viral on social media appear to show audience members screaming Islamophobic hate speech outside movie theaters and calling for boycotts of Muslim-owned businesses.

In one, a man can be heard imploring audience members to never watch a film with Muslim actors. In another, a man tells a reporter to ""stay far away"" from Muslims after exiting the theater. ""They can attack us again,"" he is heard saying.

Several petitions have been filed to prevent the film from being shown in local theaters, out of fear that the movie could fuel -- or has already fueled -- anti-Muslim sentiments.

And some Muslims have reported fearing for their safety while watching the movie. Recounting her experience in the Washington Post , prominent Indian journalist Rana Ayyub wrote: ""I left the theater, just 30 minutes into the movie, feeling humiliated and physically unsafe. A man yelled at me ""Ja Pakistan!"" (Go to Pakistan).""

While some Kashmiri Pandits believe the film helps spotlight a neglected part of their history, Nitasha Kaul, a Kashmiri novelist and associate professor in politics and international relations at the University of Westminster, said the film is a ""troubling"" account of her community's painful experiences of murder, violence and forced displacement.

She believes displaced Pandits -- of whom about 60,000 fled Kashmir after January 1990, according to the Indian government -- have never been given adequate support and were left to battle their trauma in isolation while attempting to build new lives elsewhere.

Kaul believes the BJP is brazenly adopting the film for political gain and to further a Hindutva ideology that seeks to transform secular India into a Hindu nation.

""The movie is divisive and clearly has propagandist intent,"" said Kaul in a phone interview. ""It is Islamophobic and deeply so. It has missed numerous opportunities to portray any solidarity between Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Muslims. And it has been backed by those who control the state.""

Agnihotri has repeatedly rejected criticism of his movie.

""The truth inspired me to make this film,"" the director told CNN via WhatsApp, explaining that he wrote the script after speaking with hundreds of Kashmiri Pandit families who were impacted by the violence.

""I believe the biggest enemy of humanity is terrorism, so I decided to make a film based on the living victims of Kashmir genocide.""

""How can a film on terrorism be propaganda?"" he added. ""The film is only against terrorism. I have not criticized Muslims.""

The BJP did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.

Kashmir as a political weapon

Tensions in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region, have run high for decades due to a complex and bitter territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that has, on several occasions, led to military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

In the 1980s, an insurgency by separatist Islamic militants began targeting Kashmiri Hindus -- who were considered pro-India by the separatists -- forcing thousands of people to flee their homes and killing as many as 400, though estimates vary.

The militants also attacked fellow Muslims during the unrest, according to Kaul.

Against this backdrop, ""The Kashmir Files"" follows the story of a young Hindu university student who fled Kashmir for New Delhi as a young child after his family was killed by insurgents. Raised by his grandfather and shielded from the nature of his parents' deaths, the student goes on a journey to uncover the truth of his past, aided by old newspaper clippings. The timeline flits between the past and present.

But according to Kaul, ""The Kashmir Files"" rewrites history and ignores political and geographical complexities by blaming regional instability on Muslims alone. Furthermore, she added, the movie fails to depict any of the recorded examples of solidarity between the two religious groups during the conflict -- or acknowledge the violence carried out by militants against moderate Muslims.

""The film completely collapses the multi-dimensional Kashmiri trauma into a very simplistic morality tale,"" she said. ""It relentlessly hammers away that Kashmiri Muslims are the perpetrators of all suffering... instead of showing any solidarity or attempts by Kashmiri Muslims to help the Pandits. It universally reduces them to terrorist figures.""

Umesh Talashi, a Kashmiri Pandit who is now a member of the Jammu Kashmir National Conference political party, was 6 years old when the insurgency began. Speaking about the movie, he told CNN that sympathetic Kashmiri Muslims helped his father hide from Islamic militants during the insurgency.

""I will never forget the help they gave my family,"" he said over the phone from his home in Jammu. ""I'm not against the depiction of cruelty against the Kashmiri Pandits in the film. But I'm against how all Muslims were depicted as evil terrorists. It is fueling hate and creating a social divide instead of healing old wounds.""

The director acknowledged he had heard ""a few stray stories"" but that the film ""is not about the Hindu-Muslim brotherhood,"" instead choosing to focus on ""victims and what happened with them because of terrorism.""

Audience reception

Numerous reviews have noted that Muslims are portrayed as villains throughout the film's historical scenes, with the men often depicted holding weapons and wearing heavy kohl-eyeliner and Islamic dress as they commit heinous acts of violence.

Farooq Malik Bitta, a character seemingly based on real-life separatist figures Farooq Ahmed Dar and Yasin Malik, commands the most horrifying scenes, including one where he forces a Pandit woman to eat rice soaked in her murdered husband's blood. Elsewhere, a Muslim neighbor, who at first shows concern for a Hindu family's safety, later betrays them by giving the militants their hiding location. Muslim children are even shown tormenting a young Hindu boy.

In the movie's modern-day timeline, Kashmiri characters praise the BJP for revoking the region's constitutional autonomy and bringing it under closer government control in 2019 -- a move that was, in fact, criticized by many high-profile Kashmiris and international human rights organizations . A liberal university professor is meanwhile portrayed negatively because she advocates for an independent Kashmir and sympathizes with the region's Muslims.

When asked about if the events depicted in ""The Kashmir Files"" could drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims, Agnihotri said such accusations were ""agenda-driven"" and that his film is a ""response"" to ""religious fundamentalist terrorism.""

The movie has been well-received in many quarters -- with reviews describing it as ""must watch"" and ""gut-wrenching,"" while others commend the actors' performances. Aarti Tikoo, a Kashmiri Pandit and journalist, wrote that the film has ""done what nobody else in the Indian cinema could accomplish.""

""It brings out, in multiple shades, the denial of our story by the Indian bureaucracy, media, academia and intelligentsia,"" she wrote. ""The most gruesome acts of terror unleashed on Hindus in Kashmir and later their life in displacement and destitution in refugee camps in Jammu, have been shown with remarkable intensity, and yet poignantly.""

And the success of the film has not surprised Agnihotri, who said he's ""very glad"" that it has resonated with people. ""We tried to tell honest stories as sincerely as possible.""

He said he was also prepared for criticism.

""I knew it would come from Western media especially because they are obsessed with Islamophobia. So many people had to leave their motherland. Nobody is talking about Hinduphobia.""

Nationalist films gain support

Delhi-based film critic Tanul Thakur says the Indian film industry -- which includes Bollywood and, prior to the pandemic, generated around $2.5 billion a year -- has always been ""invested in the idea of nationalism."" Compared to the ""secular, inclusive values"" of films made in the post-independence era, many of today's storylines reflect the government's religious agenda, he said.

Since Modi came to power in 2014, the ""tone has changed,"" Thakur said in a phone interview, adding: ""We've also seen a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and caste-pride (in movies).""

""The Kashmir Files,"" is just one of many Hindu nationalist narratives that have proven popular among movie-goers. The 2017 comedy ""Toilet: Ek Prem Katha"" (""Toilet: A Love Story""), featuring Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, is about a man who builds his wife a toilet in their small village home, a nod to the BJP's rural hygiene campaign.

The 2018 historical drama ""Padmaavat,"" which tells the story of a beautiful Hindu queen whose husband is killed by a Muslim sultan, was meanwhile criticized for glorifying the misogynistic Hindu practice of ""sati"" (whereby a widow self-immolates) and for depicting Muslims as barbaric.

""PM Narendra Modi,"" a 2019 biographical drama based on the life of the prime minister and played by Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, chronicled Modi's successful rise from poor tea seller to the most powerful man in India.

Though nationalist movies like these rarely attract the political backing enjoyed by ""The Kashmir Files,"" support from the government may take the form of what is and is not shown in theaters. Indian filmmakers have faced censorship for decades, with reasons ranging from religious objections to accusations that plots are ""obscene"" or ""immoral.""

As a result, movies have been pulled from cinemas and even banned from being released altogether.

Take the 2007 drama ""Parzania,"" which tells the real-life story of a Parsi family whose son goes missing during the Gujarat religious riots of 2002 -- a time when Modi was chief minister of the western Indian state.

Although the movie was approved by India's Central Board of Film Certification, movie theaters in Gujarat refused to screen it.

Writer and director Rahul Dholakia said state officials feared backlash from right-wing Hindus unhappy with the film's portrayal of them instigating the riots, which Indian government estimates say led to more than 1,000 people -- 790 of whom were Muslims -- killed in communal violence, with thousands more displaced.

Dholakia told CNN via email that he faced numerous hurdles while promoting his film.

""The biggest challenge was to release 'Parzania' in the theaters, because in Gujarat they refused to give me a single screen. They canceled all my allotted shows three days before release,"" he said, adding officials told him ""no one will watch the film.""

""I offered to pay for all (the) seats, so that they didn't lose money. It was then that they said it was a matter of law and order.""

TV shows and movies have been boycotted, and commercials even forced off air, following outcry from the Hindu right.

In 2020, Netflix received significant backlash in India for a scene in the series ""A Suitable Boy"" that depicts a Hindu woman and Muslim man kissing at a Hindu temple.

That same year, Indian jewelry brand Tanishq withdrew an advert featuring an interfaith couple following online criticism.

In June 2021, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting proposed an amendment to its certification process that would allow the government to re-evaluate films that have already been passed by the censorship board -- a move that the BJP's opponents said would give politicians sweeping censorship powers. More than 100 actors, filmmakers and producers penned an open letter imploring the government to rethink its decision, calling it ""another blow to the film fraternity.""

By contrast, the BJP's overt support for ""The Kashmir Files,"" which opened in all major theaters across the country, is seen by some critics as a double standard -- particularly given the movie's violent content and sensationalized interpretation of historical events.

""Hindus and Muslims have been working together to heal from the pain,"" Talashi said. ""Kashmiri Muslims are apologetic about the past. But when you see such propaganda, when you feel such hatred, it becomes very difficult for us to bridge that gap.""

446,'Washington Crossing the Delaware' that hung in the White House up for auction at Christie's in May,"Written by Story by Reuters

The famous ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"" painting, which hung in the White House from the 1970s to 2014, is coming up for auction next month, when it is estimated to fetch about $20 million.

The 1851 oil painting is one of three versions painted by Emanuel Leutze of the man who was to be the first US President leading troops during a key moment of the American revolution. Only two survived.

The first version was destroyed during a World War II air raid in Germany, said American Art specialist Paige Kestenman at Christie's New York.

""The second is the monumental work that is the centerpiece of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's American Wing, and the third is this work right here,"" said Kestenman.

The version at New York's Met measures 12.4 x 21.25 feet (3.78 x 6.48 meters). The painting up for sale on May 12 is smaller -- about 3 x 6 feet. It had hung for decades in the White House, mainly in the West Wing reception room.

The work depicts George Washington leading soldiers across the Delaware River to surprise the infantry hiding on the other side on Christmas Night, 1776, Kestenman said.

""A German-born American immigrant, Leutze was also a staunch abolitionist and in 'Washington crossing the Delaware' he deliberately included a variety of the figures that make up the melting pot that formed the American nation,"" said Kestenman.

447,Inside Alexander Wang's controversial return to the runway,"Written by Samantha Tse Los Angeles

It almost felt like a pre-pandemic fashion event. The cool kids gathered inside Los Angeles' Chinatown Central Plaza, without masks, on Tuesday to check out Fortune City, an event and runway show pegged as a celebration of Asian American food, culture and music, hosted by Alexander Wang. The designer was making his return to the runway after an almost three-year-long pause of catwalk events.

To be honest, I was a bit weary of even attending. I wondered why Wang would stage a show now, just one and a half years after sexual misconduct allegations against him emerged. CNN reached out to Wang for an interview prior to the event, but he declined.

But I was curious to see whether or not the designer, once a key player in fashion, could bounce back after the scandal and how he might move his brand forward in a culture demanding more transparency and awareness. I also wanted to see how Wang -- who has spoken extensively about his Asian American heritage -- would express the show's idea of ""celebration."" The promotional clip released ahead of the event, an animated clip complete with a fortune cookie, red lanterns, a Chinese gateway structure and dragon, had already made me wince. Would this actually be a celebration of culture and heritage or would it rely on tropes that reinforce stereotypes that Asian Americans have been subjected to for decades?

A designer's rise and fall

There was a time when Alexander Wang was fashion royalty. His model-off-duty aesthetic exuded an effortless glamour, reflective of the club kids in downtown New York that were part of Wang's coterie -- the so-called Wang Gang -- and included actress Zoe Kravitz, models Bella Hadid, Dree Hemingway and Erin Wasson, and interior designer Ryan Korban. Wang's reimagining of streetwear-inspired designs through a luxury lens -- slouchy knits, elongated tanks, destroyed denim and loads of leather -- penetrated the fashion zeitgeist and along the way, he threw some of the most memorable afterparties during New York Fashion Week. He transformed a gas station into a venue with Courtney Love performing, threw debaucherous events like one that included pole dancers and Hooters girls carrying late-night bites, and in 2017 he hosted #WangFest, an amalgamation of his runway show, a music festival and an afterparty in Brooklyn.

But in December 2020, Wang's career seemed to come to a halt when he was accused of multiple accounts of sexual misconduct that emerged on social media. British model Owen Mooney claimed on TikTok that he was groped by the designer in a New York City club in 2017 -- the TikTok video subsequently went viral and spurred other people to come forward with their stories. At first, the designer vehemently denied the allegations that first surfaced on social media but in March 2021, after meeting his accusers and their lawyer Lisa Bloom, Wang issued an apology on his Instagram saying, he had listened to their accounts and ""regretted acting in a way that caused them pain.

A pop-up space at the event offered a sneak peak at Wang's new ""body wear"" collection that includes crewneck tees, thongs and boxer shorts, set to launch later this year. The items were hung like roast ducks. Credit: Mark Luckasavage

""While we disagree on some of the details of these personal interactions, I will set a better example and use my visibility and influence to encourage others to recognize harmful behaviors. Life is about learning and growth, and now that I know better, I will do better,"" the post stated. Bloom meanwhile tweeted that her clients ""had the opportunity to speak their truth to him and expressed their pain and hurt,"" adding that Wang's apology was acknowledged and ""we are moving forward."" No further comment or details were released from either side.

While Wang has kept a low profile since the allegations, he has been slowly hinting at a plot to return. The Taiwanese American designer unveiled a new campaign starring Lucy Liu back in December and Rihanna wore a custom design from Wang in March during a night out in Santa Monica.

But when plans for the Fortune City event were announced at the end of last month, backlash began spreading across social media immediately. Fashionista's editor Tyler McCall questioned on Twitter whether Wang could bounce back from the allegations and whether his design aesthetics would fit in today's landscape. Those tweets were re-posted on Instagram by the unofficial industry watchdog Diet Prada, which then opened a discussion around the allegations, Wang's choice of venue and whether he even deserved to show again.

Celebrating Asian American culture

Before the runway show kicked off, Wang opened a night market to the general public who applied for tickets, featuring 10 local eateries serving complimentary food. I was impressed that the food offering was a broad survey from different regions of China. And, it was delicious. Bubble tea and fresh coconut water replaced the alcohol that fueled previous Wang events, and duck baos and scallion pancakes were particularly popular. But, food aside, there didn't seem to be much celebration of Asian American culture.

Set against the backdrop of Chinatown -- with elements like the district's red lanterns and arched kiosks -- the event felt like it played on, rather than challenged, Western tropes of what ""Asianness"" is. Wang could have pushed the concept further and explored what it means to be Asian in America today, at a time when anti-Asian sentiments are at an all-time high. It was a missed opportunity to showcase a modern iteration of Asian American culture, which was disappointing as Wang's events have always been visually very strong.

The runway started shortly after 9pm and latecomers were turned away. The stage was a raised platform with a pair of Chinese guard lions perched upstage. Traditionally, these lions were placed at doors to protect a building from harmful spirits or influences. They are often seen at Chinese banquet halls, which was the inspiration for the set. Red lights flooded the stage and celebrity supporters included Kimora Lee Simons, rapper Bia, Chloe Cherry of Euphoria, international DJ Peggy Gou, K-Pop artist CL, Erika Girardi and Lisa Rinna of Housewives fame and TikToker Noah Beck. Interestingly, Wang's campaign star Lucy Liu and Rihanna were missing, as were Bella Hadid, Zoe Kravitz and Kendall Jenner -- all once a part of Wang's inner circle.

There was a lot riding on this collection. It would be Wang's attempt at navigating his way into a new fashion landscape with more awareness and inclusivity. To the brand's credit, the show's casting sent a diverse set of models down the runway. And former Victoria's Secret models Alessandra Ambrósio and a pregnant Adriana Lima, as well as Korean-American supermodel Soo Joo Park and American model Amelia Gray Hamlin added to the star power on the runway. But it was the handful of models of Asian descent wearing white jersey dresses who walked the final section that caught my eye. It's so seldom that one, let alone a group of Asian models, gets to close a major show. It was a powerful statement.

Hairstylist Charlie Le Mindu slicked hair back or left it in its natural texture, while makeup artist Diane Kendal painted dark lacquered lips to give models that distinct downtown edge.

While the wider event celebrated Asian American culture, the collection did not and drew its inspiration instead from the brand codes, which were reworked for the 2022 Wang woman.

The designer's aesthetics have always had an irreverent sexiness but with the allegations still on people's minds, it seemed quite bold to send out models baring so much skin. It featured a lot of denim and leather, from oversized gilets worn low on the hips and paired with micro bra-tops. Boots were crotch-high, shorts were tiny and suiting was deconstructed. Knitwear was shrunken into crop tops and shrugs while leggings were rouched and layered.

Wang knows his audience love a good bag -- who can forget the ubiquity of the Rockie studded duffle circa 2010? This season, he played with the scale of his bags, elongating some, while pushing others into very slouchy clutches that were almost comical. It felt like Wang had tweaked his approach and elevated the nonchalant minimalism with more tactile fabrics and modernized it. His models don't just roll from the clubs to go-sees anymore; they've matured into multi-hyphenate women with their own brands who go from the runway to meetings.

The show ended with the customary running bow that Wang is known for, minus the cartwheels, and a cannon of confetti that spinkled the stage and the guests in red -- the color of good luck and prosperity in the Chinese culture.

Overall, the event felt subdued compared to his notoriously raucous New York shindigs. Fortune City may have marked Wang's return to the runway, and it was a strong collection with many covetable pieces.

But the verdict is still out as to whether Wang's career can truly recover. His front row was missing the usual high profile squad, but local celebrities seemed happy to come out and support him. And, despite the strong backlash against the designer and the event on social media, there were no in-person protests opposing the show, only eager guests waiting in anticipation for the latest Wang spectacle.

448,Hong Kong museum removes controversial Tiananmen painting,"Written by Stephy Chung, CNN

For the last three months, Hong Kong's art galleries have been closed to the public as part of failed efforts to curtail the Omicron variant's charge through the city. But as restrictions eased Thursday, visitors returned to one museum to find some works from its contemporary Chinese art collection conspicuously absent.

Among the items removed from display at M+, a major new arts institution , was the provocative oil painting ""New Beijing"" by Chinese artist Wang Xingwei. Created in 2001, the satirical work depicts bloodied emperor penguins lying on a bicycle cart -- a thinly veiled allusion to the deaths of pro-democracy protesters, most of whom were students, during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

The painting references an image by Hong Kong photographer Liu Heung Shing, who documented the protests for The Associated Press. The penguins take the place of two injured young men that Liu had captured in the original photograph.

Images published by local media outlet Hong Kong Free Press on Thursday show a different painting in the spot where Wang's work had previously hung. Both Liu's original image and Wang's parody are owned by M+ and remain listed in the museum's online archive.

Eight other artworks were also removed from view, including the painter Wang Guangyi's depiction of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong covered with a grid of red lines. Not all of the withdrawn works contained explicitly political content. In a statement emailed to CNN, West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, the organization that oversees M+, said that paintings' removal was part of a routine ""rotation"" of exhibited art.

""It has always been M+'s plan to rotate over 200 artworks in the first year after its opening,"" the statement read, citing maintenance related to ""artwork conditions and conservation needs."" It added that further works are expected to be rotated out over the coming few months.

The organization did not directly address whether any of the works were removed for political reasons but did state that exhibitions are curated ""in full compliance with relevant laws and regulations.""

The paintings form part of a 1,500-strong trove of Chinese contemporary artworks donated to M+ by Swiss collector Uli Sigg in 2012. All of the items were created between the 1970s and 2000s -- a period in which China underwent seismic political and societal shifts.

When the museum opened in November 2021, less than 18 months after Hong Kong's sweeping National Security Law effectively curbed political dissent, many observers wondered if the collection's more risqué works -- including those by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei -- would see the light of day. Prior to M+'s opening, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had warned officials to be ""extra cautious"" in ensuring that the museum's exhibitions did not breach the new legislation.

An infamous image of Ai Weiwei holding a middle finger up to Tiananmen Square was excluded from M+'s inaugural display. But the inclusion of ""New Beijing,"" as well as various depictions of Mao Zedong, had left some in Hong Kong's art world hopeful that curators would enjoy a degree of freedom when it came to showing politically sensitive works.

Over the past six months, several high-profile Tiananmen-related artworks have been removed from view in Hong Kong, which was once the only place on Chinese soil where people could freely commemorate the victims of the bloody crackdown. (A candlelight vigil remembering the massacre's victims was held every year for three decades until it was banned in 2020.)

Among them was the renowned ""Pillar of Shame,"" a mass of writhing bodies and screaming faces that had long stood on the University of Hong Kong's campus. The sculpture was taken down in the middle of the night when students were away on winter break.

Shortly after, two other universities removed replicas of the ""Goddess of Democracy,"" a statue first erected by students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, from their campuses.

449,Stephen Wong: The painter who builds up Hong Kong's landscapes 'like Lego',"In one of his most ambitious projects to date, landscape painter Stephen Wong sets out to capture Hong Kong's 100-kilometer (62-mile) MacLehose Trail across 10 large-scale canvases and nearly 40 smaller works.

Stephen Wong openly describes himself as ""greedy."" The landscape painter is referring to his appetite for absorbing as much scenery as possible during long and sometimes arduous hikes, which see him filling sketchbooks with impressions before translating them into sumptuous paintings.

Hong Kong, the 35-year-old's home, serves as a constant muse. Its unique topography -- a mix of mountains, beaches, islands and vertiginous cityscapes, all in close proximity to one another -- inspire fantastical interpretations of what he encounters along the way. He has created hundreds of these striking works over the past decade, becoming one of city's most celebrated and collected contemporary artists.

The pandemic era has ushered in a new period of creativity for Wong. Unable to travel last year, he instead produced ""A Grand Tour in Google Earth"" -- large-scale paintings depicting places like Peru's Machu Picchu and Japan's Mount Fuji, the latter spread across five canvases. Without leaving his studio, he used satellite images from Google Earth and photos combed from the internet, as well as his own memories of places he had previously visited.

Now, in his next ambitious endeavor, Wong has returned his attention to Hong Kong, setting out to capture the 100-kilometer (62-mile) MacLehose Trail. Famed for its sweeping views of the territory's dramatic countryside, the walk is broken up into 10 stages, ranging in difficulty and ascent. Running east to west through Hong Kong's New Territories, it traverses iconic natural landmarks such as the monolithic Lion Rock and the Tai Lam Chung reservoir, better known as ""Thousand Islands Lake.""

“ I'm interested in how I interpret nature, rather than the accuracy of capturing the scenery. ” Stephen Wong, landscape painter

The new series, which Wong debuted this month via auction house Bonhams , includes 10 large canvases -- one dedicated to each of the trail's 10 stages -- as well as eight smaller paintings and more than 30 works on paper.

While the MacLehose project is one Wong had long considered embarking on, Hong Kong's rapid pace of development drove him to ""seize the chance"" and finally start work in September last year.

""I really have the feeling that everything is changing,"" he says. ""I can't be sure that everything can be here tomorrow.""

Bonhams' Head of Modern and Contemporary Art Asia Marcello Kwan, who curated the exhibition, describes Wong's artistic language as surreal and very easy to understand. But the painter's incorporation of first-person memories also makes his style very personal, added Kwan, who thinks a recent flurry of activity in Wong's career -- showing at the Art Basel art fair and prominent local galleries in the last 18 months, all while zealously painting -- comes through in his newer works.

""His color tone has changed completely compared to (his) early years, from more earthy to extremely colorful,"" Kwan said in a phone interview -- a shift he thinks ""is a conclusion of his artistic achievement of the past 10 years.""

Trail impressions

Hiking with Wong provides insight into his meditative process. Every so often he stops for 5 to 10 minutes to quickly draw whatever catches his eye, a method he prefers to taking photographs.

""Nowadays, especially with technology, we have so many ways of very accurately capturing scenery, by taking photos on iPhones,"" he says. ""But it's too fast for me.

""I like to memorize it by hand. Even though it's not that accurate, it really helps me understand the scenery more deeply.""

At the Shing Mun Reservoir, the start of the MacLehose Trail's seventh stage, he fervently sketches Hong Kong's highest peak, the 3,140-foot Tai Mo Shan, against the thin, wispy clouds. ""I always like to express the relationship between the landscape and the sky,"" he remarks, pointing out the contrast between the hard mountains and soft clouds.

Later in the hike he pauses to sketch tall, verdant trees that at first seem unremarkable, given their ubiquity along the trail. But Wong is drawn to how this particular cluster divides the scenery in two -- mountains to its left and the manmade reservoir and high-rises to the right. ""I really like (these) types of conversations,"" he adds.

Sergio Koo, a friend and collector of Wong's work, joined him for about half of the MacLehose's 10 stages. For Koo, hiking with the painter gives him the opportunity to discover parts of the landscape that he, as an avid runner, typically speeds past.

""It's interesting to see how he puts (certain) experiences in the painting,"" Koo says over the phone, picking out sights they had encountered that made their way into Wong's paintings: a lone tree and the jagged outline of catchwater that the pair, along with another friend, had walked along.

Normally, Koo runs past the concrete channel, which marks the last stretch of the 100-kilometer (62-mile) trail, as quickly as possible.

""Now, even the most boring part of the trail becomes interesting.""

Building landscapes

Back in his studio, Wong recomposes parts of the trail using his sketches and memories from the hike. He uses his imagination to fill in the rest.

Bright, vibrant greens and contrasting colors depict everything from undulating mountain ranges to evocative pink trees with midnight-blue tops. His painting of the Sai Kung peninsula, seen from the MacLehose's fourth stage, envisions clouds as cotton candy mounds erupting against a mint green sky, offsetting a sunset that spills into the repetitious peach-colored brushstrokes of the lapping ocean.

As well as incorporating dreamlike hues, Wong sometimes changes the orientation of key landmarks (like the reservoir in stage seven that appears to the east of Needle Hill, instead of the west), adding to the feeling of the imaginary rooted in reality.

""I'm interested in how I interpret nature, rather than the accuracy of capturing the scenery,"" Wong explains. ""For me it's just like playing Lego. You build the landscape by compositions, lines and colors.""

While his canvases are remarkably immersive, the inclusion of miniature people -- they are depicted hiking, doing outdoor activities, like parachuting, or even painting -- play ""an important role,"" says Kwan, the curator.

""When you get closer, you see tiny, tiny people are actually inside the paintings,"" he adds. ""That's the most beautiful part, for me.

""Of course, the landscape is wonderful. But in the end, I think it's about humans. So although the people are so tiny, every person in the picture counts as a very important element. It's about their journey. Stephen is looking at other people, but also at himself as one of the participants in this journey.""

450,'Fashioning Masculinities:' Tracing the history of gender-fluid menswear,"Written by Leah Dolan, CNN London Contributors Max Burnell, CNN, Angelica Pursley, CNN

A long cape in a light-catching dusty pink; a floral brocaded silk robe with a cinched waist; a military buff coat decorated with dainty ribbon fastenings -- these are some of the most subversive items featured in the new exhibition ""Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear,"" at London's Victoria and Albert museum (the V&A). But this distinctly feminine menswear isn't the work of today's new-gen fashion designers -- they are historical artifacts from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

""We really want to show people the long history of changing ideas of masculinity,"" co-curator Rosalind McKever told CNN at the museum's exhibition preview. ""(What should menswear look like) feels like such a contemporary question, but this is a much longer story than maybe some people realize.""

Located in the V&A's subterranean gallery space, ""Fashioning Masculinities"" focuses on three key aspects of menswear: underwear, extravagant regalia and of course, the suit. While each element flows rhythmically onto the next, this is not your typical journey through history. Instead, contemporary looks by young designers sit alongside their historical references, often blending in seamlessly with the past. A corseted silk dress with full farthingale-style skirt looks straight out of a 16th-century ballroom, when in reality it debuted last September on a London runway during the Edward Crutchley Spring-Summer 2022 show.

Pink, frilly and fun: Why the history of menswear will surprise you

Plaster casts of classical statues such as Apollo Belvedere and Farnese Hermes stand across from a Calvin Klein advertisement, showcasing a near-ancient societal standard: rippling muscles and taut stomachs. But for every exhibition piece that upholds a traditional version of masculinity, there are three more waiting to exaggerate or dismantle the performance of gender altogether. For instance ""Tiresias,"" a video piece by Canadian transgender artist Cassils plays just a few feet from the ivory European statues. In it, an ice sculpture of a classically idealized masculine torso disintegrates with the body heat of Cassils' naked frame pressed against it. Once the ice has melted, the viewer is left with a new image of manhood: a transmasculine body without surgical intervention.

While ""Fashioning Masculinities'' centers on menswear, gender fluidity is the bedrock of much of what is on show. It's a school of thought that promotes authentic living (and dressing), says gender-fluid designer Harris Reed, who features in the exhibition. ""I've gone into my craft because I didn't want to make another box for what a woman is or a man is, or even for what a non-binary person is,"" Reed told CNN. ""You are creating something for that body, for that being. It's about living without boundaries and without borders.""

Included in the exhibition is a metallic fuchsia ensemble complete with large puff-sleeves, a tall ruffled collar and pussy bow created by Reed while he was still a student at London's prestigious fashion school Central Saint Martins. It became the blueprint for a custom design Harry Styles would wear on his 2017-18 world tour, and catapulted Reed into the spotlight overnight. Years later, he designed a suit-dress for Styles in his landmark Vogue cover shoot in November 2020

""Being included in an exhibition like this is quite surreal,"" he said. ""I remember going to a museum as a small kid and not seeing any representation of myself whatsoever. So it's quite an emotional thing coming here today and really seeing everything together.""

""We're seeing such creativity, excitement and diversity in the menswear industry,"" said McKever, ""but also a shift within the fashion industry to thinking differently about gender.""

""Fashion is one of the easiest things to push the conversation forward around gender, around queer identity, around self-expression,"" agreed Reed. ""It starts to change the way we interact with each other, and how we grow as a society.""

""Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear"" is open from March 19 until November 6, 2022.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/fashioning-masculinities-va-harris-reed/index.html
451,"Alive with 13,000 'floating' orchids, this is a garden like no other","Written by Dan Hodge, CNN Amanda Sealy, CNN Tokyo, Japan

Patience. Understanding. Tranquility. This is what Tokyo-based "" ultra-technologists "" teamLab wants visitors to experience when they enter its new artwork, entitled ""Floating Flower Garden; Flowers and I are of the Same Root, the Garden and I are One.""

But this immersive installation marks a departure for the world-renowned collective, which is known for colliding technology and art through interactive LEDs, projections and soundscapes. Here, it is the natural, rather than the digital, that leaves visitors spellbound

Unveiled over the summer, the work is made up of over 13,000 living orchids. Suspended from the ceiling, they grow along near-invisible wires to give the impression they are floating in mid-air.

Once you approach the curtain of orchids, however, teamLab's signature magic begins to take shape. Triggered by sensors, the flowers slowly start to rise up, allowing you to enter the space, before descending again behind you.

""We are using real living orchids, but behind them are so many technologies,"" explains Takeshi Kudo, communications director at teamLab.

""The main concept is still not changed: We try to bring people inside our installations.""

Enveloped in flowers

While the artwork appears completely overrun with flowers, as they float up they create new spaces for visitors to explore. Because of this, people are able to freely wander around the installation -- albeit at a pace dictated by the flowers themselves.

""The garden starts to make a space for humans... But they are moving super slowly, so you have to adjust your time to the garden's,"" explains Kudo.

For Kudo and the teamLab collective, which comprises artists, programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians and architects, orchids were the perfect flower for the exhibition. Evolved to grow without soil, they symbolize a resilience and adaptability that the art collective hopes to explore through the artwork.

""The orchids, you can see, have so many colors and there are so many different types. They can live without soil, and we can learn so many things from these orchids and other plants. (They have) more history than human beings.""

452,Decoding the Queen's colorful style,"Written by Leah Dolan, CNN Contributors Video: Angelica Pursley, CNN; Max Burnell, CNN

As Britain's longest-reigning monarch, the Queen is both a cherished and consistent part of public life -- her image synonymous with stability and tradition to the British people.

When masses gather and wait dutifully to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty, the color she steps out in is more important than you might think, too. Standing at 5 feet 3 inches, vivid hues like yellow, fuschia, purple, chartreuse and periwinkle make her easier to spot in large crowds. The Queen's bold wardrobe is so distinctive, it has spawned entire books dedicated to recording each beaming outfit. In ""Our Rainbow Queen,"" Welsh journalist Sali Hughes notes Her Majesty's color wheel considerations: ""(she) won't wear green to grassy venues, nor dark colours against dark upholstery.""

The monarch's commitment to a vibrant color palette is a sign of respect for those who take the time to support her in person. ""She needs to stand out for people to be able to say 'I saw the Queen,'"" says Sophie Rhys-Jones, the Countess of Wessex, in the 2016 documentary ""The Queen at 90.""

There is an art to dressing one of the most photographed women in history. Over her 70-year reign the Queen has amassed an army of staffers, but few have been trusted with the task of royal dressmaker. British designers Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, Stewart Parvin and Angela Kelly have all helped develop her style -- steering clear of trend cycles that can quickly fall out of favor.

Kelly -- the Queen's sartorial adviser for almost three decades and a close confidante -- has created an air-tight formula that ensures every one of the her 300 annual engagements hits the mark. From fail-safe weighted hem-lines and wager-worthy hats, to extensively researched weather forecasts and local customs -- the Queen's outfits are nothing if not judicious.

""Our role as her dressers is to ensure that Her Majesty is appropriately attired for each occasion,"" writes Angela Kelly in her 2019 monarch-approved memoir, ""The Other Side of the Coin.""

""I look for movement with soft light materials, and might even switch on a fan to see how they behave in a breeze...As the light changes, or when Her Majesty moves to an interior space, this will have an effect on the color and texture of the fabric, and this must be taken into account.""

Her monochromatic looks are typically decorated with a three-strand pearl necklace and a sparkling antique brooch set in either gold or silver, while a glossy Launer handbag can usually be found in the crook of her elbow. Not only do these mainstay accessories bring a sense of occasion to the Queen's ensembles, they are a kind of sartorial crest on-lookers have come to expect and dissect -- with many eager to unearth sentimental stories behind each item. Take, for example, the hand-painted Centenary Rose Brooch commissioned by the Queen as a 100th birthday gift for the Queen Mother, which she in turn wore during a Christmas broadcast less than a year later after her mother passed.

For languid afternoons spent walking the grounds of the Balmoral Estate in Scotland, the Queen is quick to switch out of her color block couture and into muted country wear made of tweed and tartan. Her off-duty attire is of equal importance, and often sets the mood for political arrangements. In 2016, when the Obamas arrived at Windsor Castle to meet Her Majesty for the third time, the Queen wore a silk scarf fastened under her chin (a defining feature of her more casual outfits), signaling familiarity and an informal tone.

Fashion statements

Poised, appropriate and always strategic -- the Queen's styling choices are as much a form of diplomacy as they are an expression of identity.

In 2011, Her Majesty became the first British monarch to visit the Republic of Ireland since its creation -- and the first to enter the country in a century.

The historic state visit was not taken lightly, with tactful considerations infusing every detail of the trip right down to the stitches on her garments. The Queen masterfully demonstrated the soft power potential of fashion, arriving in Dublin wearing a green coat and matching hat -- Ireland's de facto national color. Later in the visit, she donned a white, silk gown embellished with more than 2,000 hand-sewn embroidered shamrocks and an Irish harp brooch made from Swarovski crystals.

Even in her early career, the Queen was well versed in the value of image-making and optics. Coming to power (and of age) during World War II, the young princess quickly became a vision of hope and optimism in war-torn Britain. She stoked those fires anyway she could -- carefully constructing an image that conveyed authority, elegance and decorum. One of the most readily available sources was her wardrobe.

In 1947, two years after the war had ended, the Queen used clothing ration coupons to purchase her wedding dress -- a common practice for brides at the time. It was a gesture of commonality, although Her Majesty did receive 200 extra coupons from the government to help cover the cost. The gown, made of ivory silk and duchess satin with a 15-foot train, was designed by Norman Hartnell.

At one of her more recent public engagements -- the funeral commemorating her beloved husband, the Duke of Edinburgh -- the Queen wore all black in line with a mourning tradition . Typically seen in bold colors, Her Majesty's somber outfit was all the more poignant for its rarity. Pinned to her coat was the Richmond Brooch, a diamond-encrusted wedding present gifted to Queen Mary in 1893. Her Majesty inherited the piece in 1953 and wore the flourish to Harry and Meghan's 2018 wedding, reinforcing its connection to marriage and coupledom.

453,'Anna' reveals an unseen side of fashion's most influential figure,"Written by Mariana Cerini

""The amazing thing about Anna is the average person knows who she is,"" designer Tom Ford tells fashion journalist Amy Odell in the first pages of ""Anna,"" a new biography of American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour out this week. ""You show them a picture and they say, 'That's Anna Wintour from Vogue.'""

Wintour, who has been at the helm of fashion's most influential magazine since 1988, is a household name not just in the industry, but across culture at large.

She's been the subject of documentaries and the inspiration for movies, as talked about as the celebrities she's put on her covers (rumors she was about to leave Vogue back in 2018 fueled a flurry of wild speculation online) and as immediately recognizable, thanks to her power bob and ever-present sunglasses.

""Anna,"" which Odell began writing in 2018, charts Wintour's rise, tracing her formidable career from 1960s London to one of the most powerful positions in media today. To try to paint a full picture, Odell interviewed over 250 sources -- some of whom requested anonymity -- and browsed through archival records and past coverage of the undisputed queen of fashion.

The final product is a sprawling, comprehensively reported piece of nonfiction (there are some 80 pages of footnotes) that mixes insiders' anecdotes -- Andy Warhol considered her a ""terrible dresser""; Bradley Cooper sought her advice on whom to cast in the lead role of ""A Star Is Born"" -- with a highly detailed and revelatory portrait of a very private figure.

""The goal was to draw a picture of Anna's legacy, her triumphs and troubles, and explain the ingredients to her clout and success,"" Odell said in a video interview. ""Getting to the top is one thing, but staying there is quite another. Anna has been at Vogue for 34 years. In a business like hers, that's extraordinary. I wanted to explore how she has managed to have this incredible longevity.""

Two sides of Anna

Including accounts from close friends, designers and collaborators; letters written by her father, the Fleet Street editor Charles Wintour; and insightful descriptions of just about every professional and personal decision Wintour ever made, ""Anna"" shows different sides of the influential editor-in-chief.

Odell starts from the very beginning, introducing Wintour's privileged upbringing -- her family was well-connected in the UK's literary world, and Wintour had access to a generous trust fund -- and recounting how she drifted into journalism, first in London and then in New York, where she eventually landed the top role at Vogue.

As she climbed further into the world of publishing, Wintour appeared at times quietly driven, at times ferocious in her ambition to turn Vogue and herself into an iconic brand (one of her most defining traits is her discipline: her day starts at 5.30 a.m.; her weight doesn't seem to have changed since she was 18. After she'd had a facelift at the end of 2000, Odell writes, she went back to the office with yellow bruises still visible instead of resting at home, because she never misses work.)

She is ""brutal"" in her approach to editing, staying in the office until midnight to review layouts and make edits; ""unsparing"" in her commentary on the photos in ""The Book,"" the mock-up version of the magazine she has final say on; ""militant"" in her planning of the Met Gala, for which she oversees every detail, including the guest list (""you just can't buy your way into it,"" Odell said) and the menu (she's banned chives, garlic, onion and parsley).

""Her directives were often so absurd the Met team just laughed them off,"" Odell writes about Wintour's approach to the fashion event. ""Once, when walking through the Egyptian galleries, where the display cases were empty because they were being replaced, she turned to the Met team and said, 'Where is she? Yes, you -- can you go into the basement and just bring up a bunch of art and put it in these cases?'"" (Wintour has a habit of not learning the names of the people who work under her, including her assistants and some of the museum staff.)

But she's also a dog person, a doting grandmother who changes diapers and loves to entertain, and a committed philanthropist (""there is a person there,"" Wintour's longtime Met Gala planner Stephanie Winston Wolkoff tells Odell in the book).

For Odell, this dichotomy was one of the most fascinating aspects of writing about her subject. ""What struck me during the course of my research was how complicated Anna is as a person,"" she said. ""People couldn't agree on many things about her, including whether she's an introvert or an extrovert, ruthless or just very demanding. I couldn't get a consensus.""

The last editor of her kind

Wintour herself didn't shed any light on which ""Anna"" she most identifies with. Despite multiple interview requests, the fashion figure declined to speak to Odell for the book.

Still, Odell noted, she didn't shut it down.

""When I started working on 'Anna,' people told me it could go two ways: She would try to stop me, maybe warning sources not to talk to me, as she had done with a previous unauthorized biography; or she would help. The latter group turned out to be correct,"" she said.

A year and a half into the project, with some 100 interviews under her belt -- mostly from Wintour's early life and career, as those sources ""seemed to be less skittish about talking to me,"" Odell said -- she received a call from the Condé Nast public relations team.

""Anna had heard about the book, and she wanted to have more details about it,"" Odell said. ""I explained that I wanted to write about a woman in a unique position of power. After that conversation, her office sent over a list of names of her closest friends and colleagues I could reach out to -- Tom Ford, Hamish Bowles, Serena Williams. I took it as a kind of endorsement.""

Access became easier after this, Odell said, although not everyone wanted to talk on the record.

While Wintour's been the subject of much gossip throughout her career, Odell noted that she hasn't done a whole lot to correct the narrative around her. ""I think in her mind, she has a job that she loves and she's going to run hard at it every single day,"" Odell said. ""That's really what drives her.""

That, and the fact she's probably the last magazine editor of her kind. As the media and publishing industry continue to be disrupted by the rise of digital content, influencers and social media, it's unlikely there will ever be another singular fashion gatekeeper as globally relevant as Wintour. She's aware of it too: Over the past decade, despite coming under fire for failing to foster diversity and inclusivity at Condé Nast on behalf of its progressive workforce, she has in fact expanded her role, becoming artistic director of Condé Nast in 2013, the company's global content adviser in 2019, and worldwide chief content officer and global editorial director of Vogue in 2020.

""Anna has always been a step ahead of everybody else in the business,"" Odell said. ""She's at the top of the pyramid. It'll be interesting to see what happens when she does leave her job -- though I am sure she already has her exit planned to perfection.""

454,'It wasn't not racist': Netflix documentary charts the troubling rise of Abercrombie & Fitch,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Abercrombie & Fitch's website is, today, awash with Gen-Z-friendly nods to diversity and inclusion. There are people of color, sizes up to 3XL and even a Pride-themed collection featuring ""gender inclusive"" rainbow tees. The brand's Instagram account, meanwhile, proudly promotes models in wheelchairs, stories of body-positivity and statements of LGBTQ solidarity.

Yet, barely disguised in the label's new tagline, ""This is #AbercrombieToday,"" is an admission that there is a yesterday it would rather we forget.

Any chance of that has been effectively dashed by Netflix's new documentary ""White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch,"" which charts Abercrombie's transformation from forgotten 19th-century outdoors retailer to the epitome of late-'90s teen fashion. Through interviews with former models, recruiters, store workers and executives, the 88-minute film suggests that appearing cool, attractive and White wasn't just an exercise in branding: it was an active corporate strategy that came at the expense of non-White employees and consumers.

For all the current messages of inclusion, millennials (and older) will remember an altogether different Abercrombie -- one that took over malls and billboards with an army of attractive models and ripped male torsos. One that spread around college campuses and was name-dropped in LFO's 1999 anthem ""Summer Girls"" (""I like girls that wear Abercrombie & Fitch,"" sang the band's late vocalist, Rich Cronin. ""I'd take her if I had one wish"").

As the Washington Post's senior critic-at-large Robin Givhan reflects in the documentary, Abercrombie's explosive success was achieved by combining the sex appeal of Calvin Klein and the elite preppiness of Ralph Lauren -- but at prices more affordable than both.

At the time, it seemed the brand could do little wrong. A former merchandiser recalls being told by a colleague that they ""could write 'Abercrombie & Fitch' with dog sh*t and put it on a baseball hat and sell it for 40 bucks."" One of the brand's former models put it even more succinctly: ""If you weren't wearing Abercrombie, you weren't cool.""

But behind the aura of exclusivity was a policy of, well, exclusivity. In a precursor to today's influencer marketing, the label hunted out good-looking employees and looked to college fraternities and sororities for models and store workers -- a cool-kids-only strategy underpinned by a tacit understanding of whose looks qualified as ""all-American."" Former staff members reveal in-house guidelines that fall just short of racially explicit language, though descriptions of dreadlocks as ""unacceptable,"" for instance, made the implications clear enough to one ex-recruiter, who says: ""It wasn't not racist.""

The company declined to comment on specific allegations made in the documentary, though current CEO Fran Horowitz told CNN in a statement: ""We own and validate that there were exclusionary and inappropriate actions under former leadership,"" adding that the company is now ""a place of belonging.""

""We've evolved the organization, including making changes in management, prioritizing representation, implementing new policies, re-envisioning our store experiences and updating the ﬁt, size-range and style of our products,"" she said.

'Are we exclusionary? Absolutely'

The company began facing accusations of wrongdoing from around the turn of the millennium. In 2003, a group of former employees and job applicants sued Abercrombie & Fitch for discrimination. Several of the plaintiffs appear in Netflix's documentary to reiterate longstanding claims that Black, Asian American and Hispanic employees had their hours reduced, were let go or were forced into backroom roles on account of their appearance.

Abercrombie settled the suit in 2004, paying out around $40 million to its accusers. And although the firm never admitted guilt in the case, it did agree to a non-binding Consent Decree that saw a court overseeing improvements to its hiring, recruitment and marketing practices. While there were evident improvements in the diversity seen on Abercrombie's shop floors, the company would later end up in the Supreme Court after a Muslim American woman, Samantha Elauf, claimed she refused a job in 2008 because she wore headscarf. The court ruled 8-1 in her favor.

The documentary also revisits other troubling parts of Abercrombie's success story, including its close relationship with fashion photographer Bruce Weber, who has since been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous models. (Weber has always denied the allegations, telling the New York Times in 2017 that he ""never touched anyone inappropriately."") Other now-unthinkable decisions include offensive T-shirts that used stereotypical Asian fonts and caricatures, including one featuring the fictional Wong Brothers Laundry Service and its slogan ""Two Wongs Can Make it White.""

What is shocking about the documentary, however, is not only the nature of the accusations -- many of which have long been in the public domain -- but how long it took for a reckoning to arrive.

Abercrombie made little secret of wanting its clothes to be worn by people who looked a certain way. In 2006, former CEO Mike Jeffries effectively spelled out his tactics in a now-infamous profile on the news site Salon, saying: ""We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong (in our clothes), and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.""

The comments went almost unnoticed at the time. It would be well into the next decade before Jeffries' quote -- and the brand's history of problematic marketing and advertising -- became more of a corporate liability. But then, as a young and socially aware generation of customers began taking notice, the floodgates opened.

In 2013, a teenage eating disorder survivor Benjamin O'Keefe started a Change.org petition , signed by almost 80,000 people, that urged the label to offer sizes XL and above. That same year, filmmaker Greg Karber went viral with his #FitchTheHomeless campaign and video, which saw him donating Abercrombie clothes to homeless people in a riposte to Jeffries' exclusionary approach. Plus-size blogger Jes Baker created a series of inclusive spoof adverts that changed the brand's logo to read ""Attractive & Fat.""

The next year, Jeffries stepped down as CEO amid declining sales, paving the way for another rebranding exercise. But, like various other documentaries revisiting troubling elements of our not-too-distant past, ""White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch"" is less an exposé of what happened under his leadership and more a reflection on what we, as a society, allowed to happen. As the Asian American students who protested the ""Wong Brothers"" T-shirts in 2002 might well attest, objections to the brand's behavior have always existed -- it's just that someone finally stopped to listen to them.

""There were probably just as many people as there are now who hated what we were doing, who were completely offended, who didn't feel included, who didn't feel represented,"" reflects one ex-employee near the end of the documentary. ""But they didn't have the platform to be able to voice it and now they do.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/abercrombie-fitch-exclusion-netflix-documentary/index.html
455,"In new pandemic novel, 'Station Eleven' author explores how the apocalypse is always now","Written by Brienne Walsh, CNN

Fans of Marvel movies love that the franchise encompasses a multiverse where well-known characters such as Captain America, Spiderman and Doctor Strange can shift identities and destinies depending on which storylines they inhabit. In her latest work, science fiction author Emily St. John Mandel -- of ""Station Eleven"" (2014) fame -- builds on a similar approach.

""The Sea of Tranquility"" offers a multiverse in which characters from ""The Glass Hotel"" (2020) reappear and are given new storylines. Mandel did something similar in ""The Glass Hotel"" with Miranda and Leon from ""Station Eleven,"" the dystopian novel that was recently turned into a miniseries on HBO Max.

""It's just fun to create a multiverse,"" Mandel said in a phone interview. ""(My characters) feel like they're part of some greater, overarching story.""

Spanning six centuries -- from 1912 to 2401 -- ""The Sea of Tranquility"" starts right before World War I and ends up at a human colony on the moon. When Mandel sat down to write the novel, it was the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. She was in lockdown in her apartment in New York with her husband and her daughter, and everywhere on Earth seemed too close.

""My immediate instinct was to set (the story) really far away,"" she said. ""So, I set it on the moon.""

Real or simulation?

All of the characters, including Edwin St. John St. Andrew, a 20th-century minor aristocrat who travels by rail across Canada; Olive Llewellyn, a 23rd-century author who Mandel admits is based on herself; and Gaspery-Jacques, a time traveler from a 25th-century colony on the moon, are bound together by a single anomaly that rips through the fabric of space and time, and punctures ordinary notions of reality. Disorienting in nature, the anomaly acts as a sort of tunnel that allows characters across centuries to experience one another's environments.

At the core of the novel is the question of whether the multiverse Mandel has created is ""real,"" or if it is a computer simulation being run by some unknown overlord, human or otherwise. Simulation hypotheses -- like the one famously explored in ""The Matrix"" films -- have become increasingly popular in recent years (both Elon Musk and Neil Degrasse Tyson have said the theory as plausible), and they are used by certain scientists and philosophers to explain things about our universe that appear inexplicable. In ""The Sea of Tranquility,"" a simulation hypothesis is offered as an explanation for future humans' ability to time travel, a feat that is almost mind-blowing in its physical implications.

Mandel first discovered simulation theory while she was procrastinating on the internet, and she said she was struck by its similarity to the way we write history. For example, as she was writing ""The Sea of Tranquility,"" protests were breaking out across the United States that questioned long-held assumptions -- such as, that all people are treated equally in American society. In both history and simulations, Mandel said, we're living inside of a construct.

Apocalypse now

Pandemics play an important role in ""Sea of Tranquility,"" as they did in earlier novels by Mandel. Almost all the characters weather them: Edwin St. John St. Andrew experiences the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and Olive Llewellyn, who grew up on the moon colonies, travels across Earth, giving interviews to journalists about her own pandemic novel as a form of SARS slowly erupts into a full-blown catastrophe.

In a lecture, Olive delivers words that Mandel herself has said many times in a talk she gives on the popularity of post-apocalyptic literature, of which ""Station Eleven"" is a prime example: ""I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we're living at the climax of the story.""

In truth, Mandel said, the apocalypse is always now, one of the true constants of human history, whether simulated or not. ""I believe that the world is always ending, or maybe a better way to put it is that a world is always ending,"" she said. ""And that means that a new world is always kind of silently shifting into place around us.""

Pointing to a turn of phrase first written by the author Arundhati Roy in an editorial for the Financial Times, Mandel noted, ""a pandemic is a portal."" For example, the Covid-19 pandemic has permanently changed the workplace and transitioned many office jobs into the home. ""That's a pretty profound difference in quality of life for a lot of people, and it just happened,"" Mandel said. In the period of two years, humans time traveled into a previously unimaginable future. A new world, Mandel says, visibly settled around us.

The new world

As an author of speculative fiction, Mandel is tasked with filtering out what will survive from our present moment -- in ""The Sea of Tranquility,"" her novel travels as far in the future as we are currently away from the Renaissance. Nothing we think is important will likely last that far in the future, and if we were to travel there, people we talked to would struggle to understand us even if we spoke the same language.

Like a paperback novel placed on a high shelf during a flood, ""we like to think that the things that survive are the heartbreaking works of staggering genius,"" Mandel said.

In ""The Sea of Tranquility,"" Mandel insists that other, more insidious parts of culture survive as well, such as the sexism that successful mothers face when they temporarily prioritize their careers over their families. In a taxicab in the year 2203, for example, Olive Llewellyn is asked why, if she has a daughter at home on the moon, she is on a book tour on Earth. ""F--k you, I know you would never ask a man that question,"" Olive thinks to herself.

""The more hopeful part of me would say, well, now this is fiction, like of course, it'll be different (in 200 years),"" Mandel said. ""But why isn't it different now?""

Ultimately, despite the challenges we face, including future pandemics and climate change, Mandel believes that humans will persist into the future. ""There will still be people, and they will still be living some kind of life,"" she said. Even if the aliens running our simulation pull the plug, our stories will remain.

""There's always a new world appearing,"" she said. ""And there is a lot of hope in that.""

""Sea of Tranquility,"" published by Knopf, is available now.

Add to queue: Sweet speculation

If you're ready to explore more brave new worlds, Mandel recommended these five works of speculative fiction:

Colson Whitehead's novel takes place in Manhattan after a pandemic turns half of humankind into feral zombies.

Watch: ""Looper"" (2012)

In this science fiction film directed by Rian Johnson and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels and Bruce Willis, contract killers send victims back in time to get rid of them.

Watch: ""Station Eleven"" (2021)

The television series, created by Patrick Somerville, is based on Mandel's novel and follows survivors of a fictional pandemic who are struggling to rebuild their lives. ""I know, I'm biased,"" Mandel said. ""But I think the series is extraordinary and I had nothing to do with creating it, so feel it's fair to add it to my list.""

456,A design history of the world's most popular sport,"Written by Jacopo Prisco, CNN London

The very first FIFA World Cup final, contested by Uruguay and Argentina in 1930, started with a disagreement: Who would supply the ball?

Both teams wanted to, because they were used to playing with their own equipment and didn't trust one another. In the end, a compromise was reached: The first half would be played with the Argentinians' ball, and the second half with the Uruguayans'.

The contrast was stark. Argentina led 2-1 at halftime, but after switching balls, Uruguay won 4-2, bringing home the inaugural trophy in international football's premier competition.

""One (of the balls) had 12 panels while the other had 11, and they had slightly different weight and texture because of the difference in paneling and stitching,"" said Eleanor Watson, lead curator of ""Football: Designing the Beautiful Game,"" a new exhibition at London's Design Museum. ""So from a technical performance aspect, it really had an influence on the outcome of the game.""

The show welcomes visitors with the very two balls used in that legendary final. They beautifully embody the stereotypical vintage football, their rough surfaces and heavy stitching a far cry from the sleek, light designs used in the modern game. And they are just two of about 500 objects -- spanning equipment, uniforms, badges, photographs, banners, posters and even pieces of stadiums -- that illustrate how design has shaped the world's most popular sport.

It's not an easy relationship to explore, or even make an exhibition about, said Watson. ""To be honest with you, when I first pitched it, our head of marketing at the time told me it was a really bad idea and that people associate design and football with this very unwanted commercial presence -- everything they resent and find problematic about the current state of the game."".

The exhibition aims to set the record straight, unpicking the role designers and architects have played since the emergence of professionalism in football in the 1880s. Its scope ranges from banners and jerseys to the less expected, such as stadium architecture, graphic design, collectibles and new developments like eSports.

Boots, including several designed specifically for women, are well represented in the lineup of objects, which includes pairs worn by two of the game's most revered players, George Best and Lionel Messi. Elsewhere, early Adidas and Puma boots represent not only the rivalry between the two German sportswear brands -- founded by brothers Adi and Rudi Dassler, respectively, and part of a complex family feud -- but another key design moment in the history of the sport: the development of screw-in cleats.

""In 1954, West Germany were playing in the FIFA World Cup final against Hungary, the darlings of the tournament and undisputedly the best team at that time. They were winning and then, famously, it started raining very hard,"" said Watson.

At halftime, Adi Dassler, West Germany's official footwear supplier, unscrewed the cleats on the players' boots and replaced them with longer ones that offered better grip on the soggy pitch. West Germany went on to win the final,an unexpected victory dubbed the ""Miracle of Bern,"" a reference to the Swiss city that hosted the match. ""At that moment, it really sunk into everyone's mind that these pieces of performance equipment played a really important role in giving teams a competitive advantage,"" said Watson.

A more subtle contribution to the game -- but one that has proven paramount to the identities of players and fans alike -- is that of graphic design. Its influence is particularly evident in the evolution of team badges and logos. ""As with so many aspects of football design, these started from a basic practical consideration: In the early days of football people couldn't afford football kits, so a very easy way to produce one was to tell everyone to wear a badge. You would just sew one on normal clothing and hey presto, you'd have a uniform,"" said Watson.

There are several iconic jerseys on display at the exhibition, perhaps most notably the one worn by Brazilian legend Pelé when he made his World Cup debut in 1958 at the age of 17. Another prominent display focuses on famous number 10s, with jerseys (many of them signed) belonging to legendary wearers of the magic number, such as Diego Maradona, Roberto Baggio, Zico and Michelle Akers, who led the US women's soccer team to two World Cup wins and an Olympic gold medal in the 1990s.

Two of the largest objects in the collection come from stadiums: a slice of the iconic facade of the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany, whose exterior is the largest membrane shell in the world, and an early turnstile, an object that represents the coming of age of football -- the monetization that turned fans from supporters into customers.

And, just like a football match, the show has an intermission: half-time space reminiscent of stands in a stadium, where visitors can sit and enjoy a video installation of crowds at Rio de Janeiro's famous Maracanã stadium.

In the final section, the exhibition showcases the work of football charities like Goal Click, which sends disposable cameras to sporting communities around the world -- including the Gilgit-Baltistan Girls Football League, the first ever girls' league in northern Pakistan -- and asks them to document their experiences. ""It's a way of shining light on different kinds of people who are using football as a means to express themselves,"" said Watson.

457,I went to fashion week in the metaverse,"Written by Leah Dolan, CNN

The day before covering a fashion week in virtual reality felt much like the day before any industry event, only instead of renting outfits and planning travel routes, I was downloading Google Chrome extensions and over-thinking the creation of my digital avatar. (I played it safe in the end, pairing my natural hair and eye color with a cute nautical-inspired top and one raised eyebrow for a permanently skeptical expression.)

I was preparing to attend a week-long virtual fashion event in the metaverse: a network of unique digital worlds that has grabbed the fashion world's attention. Industry title The Business of Fashion has projected it will be the "" next goldmine ,"" as young consumers continue to tunnel deeper into virtual reality (81% of Gen-Z played video games in the past six months, according to the title's ""State of Fashion"" report which also recorded the younger generation already spends an average of 7.3 hours per week in virtual worlds).

While fashion shows have already been staged in the metaverse (designers such as Mimi Wade, Mowalola and Collina Strada have shown individual collections on the virtual platform IMVU ), the event, which began on March 24, hosted by online platform Decentraland, included a packed schedule of catwalks from the likes of Dolce & Gabbana and Philipp Plein, fire-side chats with Tommy Hilfiger himself and even a virtual performance by Grimes, setting it apart as an all-encompassing event experience. It's likely to become an annual tradition, said Sam Hamiliton, creative director of Decentraland Foundation during a Zoom call. ""There's still a lot of moving parts, which I think is kind of traditional, but I feel confident,"" he told CNN ahead of the event's opening. ""Behind the scenes, it's a virtual version of a real fashion week. There's still people sewing backstage, if you like, in 3D software.""

But the final experience was far from seamless -- technical difficulties, overheating hard drives and lack-luster graphics dimmed the fantasy of this supposedly limitless landscape.

To enter the metaverse, you first need to verify yourself. One option (the only option that worked for me and my decade-old MacBook Air) is by linking your mobile crypto wallet. My decidedly empty crypto wallet appeared in the corner of my screen for the entire session -- something of a dampener on the aspirational nature of fashion.

Underdressed and underwhelmed

But who would spend their cold hard cash in this bizarre digital clubhouse, anyway? Every avatar is allotted at least 30 garments they can wear for free, and even a handful of quirky accessories like sunglasses or tiaras. A few digital t-shirts seemed to be more than enough creative expression for something as intangible as the metaverse. Or so I thought.

The first event I logged on for was the Dolce & Gabbana x UNXD catwalk show, where the Italian label debuted 20 metaverse wearable looks inside a venue that felt part-football stadium, part nightclub. It was one of the first shows of the week, and as the purple and black dance floor blinked away in silence (music patched in and out at random intervals) attendance seemed light with what appeared to be around 25 attendees. Some beamed in late -- literally, in a flash of electric blue light -- and missed the show entirely, while other avatars, often melded together due to glitchy graphics, stared blankly ahead. In the bottom left-hand corner of my screen was a running chat box feature that suggested some guests were still getting to grips with the technology. Before the event, a steady flow of sarcastic comments evidenced a cynical atmosphere. ""Wow, this place is pumping,"" remarked one user. ""How do I have fun here?"" asked another.

Instead of using human avatars as models, Dolce & Gabbana interpreted the concept of a catwalk literally -- by sending giant, bipedal feline creatures down the circular runway. But the clothes -- if you could call the indistinguishable collection of pixels clothes -- paled in comparison to the inventive outfits of my fellow avatars. Splayed glowing falcon wings, neon changshans, gold chrome cyclops sunglasses and Tron-looking black leggings with electric blue panels; the metaverse dress code was futuristic chaos , and suddenly my freebie tiara wasn't cutting it. But kitting yourself out, even virtually, is an expensive endeavor. Printed bucket hats and puffer jackets, as well as a glowing winged tuxedo from notoriously ostentatious label Philipp Plein ranged anywhere from $1,670 to $2,740 a piece

As well as a schedule of runway shows, Decentraland also built a luxury shopping district -- like a digital fifth avenue. Lavish storefronts by Elie Saab, Peter Dundas, D&G, Etro and South-American brand Chufy sat on an elegant, shrubbery-lined street. Here, the attention to detail was impressive, from the monogrammed awning extending from each window to the opulent architecture. For instance, suspended storks hung above the exterior of Chufy's digital flagship, which was then plastered in rainbows and Japanese Ukiyo-e art, including Katsushika Hokusai's ""The Great Wave.""

Inside the Peter Dundas store, a screen built into the back wall played the label's live action Pre-Fall 2022 campaign video. Cyber mannequins stood poised in pixelated versions of the looks shown on-screen. Users were supposed to be able to purchase the wearables to strut around Decentraland, but since no amount of clicking would allow me to try on these chic outfits it was more of a cold spectacle than a revolutionized shopping experience.

Elsewhere in the metaverse, Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY and Selfridges set up similar pop-up stores. Some, like Selfridges, built huge postmodern structures with multiple floors, while other stores looked more like facades or open showrooms, plastered with logos and campaign imagery. Each participating fashion house -- a hot ticket, according to Hamiliton, who said he was still turning down brands hours before the event kicked off -- was paired with a team of Decentraland 3D software designers who built the wearables on display.

After some window shopping I headed to the Philipp Plein afterparty, where around 70 to 90 players ""emoted"" -- that is to say, performed pre-programmed movements like blowing a kiss, angry hand gestures, raising one hand like an inquisitive student and several dance movements -- in front of a live streamed DJ set beamed from someone's living room.

This curious party was held in ""Plein Plaza"" -- a sparse digital space that includes the designer's ominous-looking $1.4 million cyber skyscraper. Across from the monogrammed tower is M.O.N.A -- Plein's underground Museum of NFT Art that showcases an exhibition of unreleased NFTs created by the designer and his collaborator and digital artist, ​​Antoni Tudisco.

A future worth exploring

While other designers rented their retail space for the event, Plein purchased his plot of digital land in February . His decision speaks to the high hopes many have of metaverse fashion. But the experience has a long way to go if it's to become a shopping destination, rather than a gimmick.

Decentraland's event has been described as the first inclusive fashion week, offering a front-row seat to anyone with a crypto wallet (in reality, not that many). But it took two Mac computers and a Dell laptop for me to finally enter Decentraland -- and even then my sessions lasted 15 minutes at a time before crashing.

And while virtual fashion weeks can limit the likes of air travel and wasteful set builds for shows, there is also an environmental cost to virtual realms that rely heavily on sophisticated computer systems.

Glitches aside, the experience did offer a window into a fascinating future, worthy of exploration. The ambition behind Decentraland's first fashion week was cause for celebration. And if fashion is about newness and novelty, then the metaverse was the most en vogue venue in town. More than the billed designers, it was the other guests that brought an outpouring of creativity. It also demonstrated potential for other industries, too. Beauty brand Estée Lauder's giant rotating bottle of Advanced Repair night serum was a marketing sight to behold, and the digital photography exhibition ""Unplanned Paths"" at the cyber gallery ""The Chockablock"" was immersive enough to feel like a real alternative to in-person viewing.

But unless you're joining on a gaming PC (and even then, expect intense lagging ), virtual fashions week may be as inaccessible as the real thing. For now.

458,Paris Fashion Week: How luxury fashion responded to the war on Ukraine,"A week of fashion shows in the French capital, against the backdrop of a full-scale crisis in Europe, saw symbolic gestures, quieter moments of reflection and pledges of financial support from a number of houses.

In the month leading up to the Fall-Winter shows in Paris, it was widely believed that the event would mark a significant return to business as usual -- a celebration for the fashion world after two years of pandemic-related disruptions. Coronavirus cases were relatively low, international travel to and from France had opened up and more brands were scheduled to stage physical instead of virtual shows.

But days before Paris Fashion Week was due due to begin, the optimistic mood shifted. On February 24, the world watched in disbelief, then in horror, as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his brutal attack on Ukraine. In Kyiv, a three-hour flight from Paris, pictures of families camped out in subway stations were akin to historical images of people in London seeking shelter below ground during bombing raids in World War II.

Ralph Toledano, president of Paris Fashion Week's organizing body, the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM), issued a statement on March 1 urging attendees of the event to ""experience the shows of the coming days with solemnity, and in reflection of these dark hours.""

Speaking a week later, after fashion week had wrapped, Toledano told CNN that on the Sunday night before the first day of shows, he had two clashing images in his mind. On the one side, the excitement of fashion week's return with live runways unhampered by the pandemic. On the other, images of war and ""a country being attacked in a very cruel and savage way... and people dying, and people suffering.""

Simply put, a glitzy week of shows, parties and celebrity cameos was at complete odds with a war in Europe.

In direct acknowledgment of this tension, the mononymous creative director of luxury house Balenciaga, Demna, issued a statement ahead of his collection reveal, which took place during the second half of the week. ""Fashion feels like some sort of absurdity,"" he wrote in a note to guests, adding that he had considered canceling the event altogether.

""The war in Ukraine has triggered the pain of a past trauma I have carried in me since 1993, when the same thing happened to my home country and I became a forever refugee,"" wrote the Georgian designer.

In the early 1990s, the designer and his family were among tens of thousands of people to flee Sukhumi, a city in Georgia, amid conflict in the disputed region of Abkhazia, which is considered independent by Russia despite being internationally recognized as part of Georgia.

Ultimately the show went ahead on Sunday, but not without a couple of symbolic gestures -- some of the more pronounced seen during the week-long schedule of events. The Ukrainian flag was draped on guests' seats and the designer recited a poem in Ukrainian by one of the country's treasured poets Oleksandr Oles. In his note, Demna said ""I realized canceling the show would mean giving in, surrendering to the evil that has already hurt me so much for almost 30 years. I decided I could no longer sacrifice parts of me to that senseless, heartless war of ego,"" he concluded.

While the collection was designed before the war broke out, it was hard not to draw parallels and, speaking to reporters backstage, Demna said the set and staging -- a shocking and stirring production -- deliberately reflected his own experience of conflict and displacement 30 years ago.

Models trudged through a set designed to mimic a bitterly cold snowstorm clutching oversized trashbags made of leather during a show that was also a comment on climate crisis.

The label's owners Kering (the parent company of Saint Laurent, Gucci and Alexander McQueen, among others) had announced two days before that it was suspending all operations in Russia.

Hermes and Cartier owner Richemont was the first to make a pledge to temporarily close stores and cease operations in Russia. LVMH (the luxury conglomerate with 14 luxury fashion houses in its portfolio, including Louis Vuitton and Loewe) and Chanel also followed suit. Many brands announced donations -- LVMH, for example, gave €5 million ($5.5 million) to the International Committee of the Red Cross to help support direct and indirect victims of the conflict.

Supermodel Gigi Hadid also pledged to donate all her earnings from fashion month to relief efforts in Ukraine, following on from a similar announcement by model Mica Argañaraz.

Small but necessary gestures

Vena Brykalin, fashion director of Vogue Ukraine, was at the Balenciaga show and various others throughout the week in Paris. He had flown from Kyiv to Milan for fashion week the day before Russia's invasion of his country. Now in Paris, without a plan for where he would go next, he found himself in limbo -- dividing his time between worried calls home to family and friends, online activism (he's been using his Instagram to share news, information about Ukrainian designers and various relief efforts led by his friends in the creative community) and the occasional fashion show.

Speaking in a car ride through Paris after the Coperni show, Brykalin reflected on attending a fashion week while a war was happening in his country.

""Fashion is a trillion-dollar industry and we know fashion weeks are a big vehicle for that, so I wouldn't expect them to shut everything down,"" he said, though adding he felt brands needed to show a sense of ""correctness and decency...a sense of context would be very great to see and feel .""

He used the Coperni show, which was staged in a warehouse in the city's suburbs, as an immediate example. The brand released a statement dedicating its show to the Cap Est Sarl atelier in Kyiv, whose tailors produce some of the label's clothing. They also sent one blue and yellow look down the runway in a show that celebrated teen spirit (lockers surrounded the square runway and the soundtrack pumped out classic high school house party tracks by The Offspring and other 90s bands).

""It's not going to change the world,"" Brykalin said, but he believes these moments are important and that silence from brands is not acceptable. ""Businesses today can't be operating in a vacuum,"" he said, noting that he disagrees with the notion that fashion is fantasy, or fashion is escapism. ""No it's not. Fashion is real,"" he said. ""And when you choose not to reflect that, I don't think it's a very modern thing to do.""

He praised Balenciaga for stating its support for Ukraine via social media in the early days of the Russian invasion, believing the brand ""set a standard"" for others and pointing to the fact that it might have even made good business sense. ""(Business) is not a dirty word here,"" he said, believing that, ""Brands who avoid the conversation because they consider it as being an economic risk for their operation,"" have got it wrong -- it's ""on the contrary,"" he said.

Some brands did lean into the idea of fashion as escapism (Loewe's show was filled with playful, surreal designs such as a duo of trapeze dresses that flowed into the shape of a car). And at the bigger shows, the usual celebrities still caused a scene (Rihanna's attendance at Dior had crowds outside screaming and guests inside craning their necks). But in this mixed bag of responses, several houses found subtle ways to acknowledge the unfolding crisis.

At the end of the Nanushka presentation, for example, three models stood on a pedestal with their eyes closed revealing blue and yellow eye makeup while a string quartet played the Ukrainian national anthem.

The brand, spearheaded by Hungarian designer Sandra Sandor, also released a statement detailing various charitable endeavors, including donating revenue from its e-commerce sales to the launch of projects the brand said will offer support to Ukrainians. A spokesperson for the label also confirmed that it has temporarily stopped sales in Russia.

Other signs of solidarity with Ukraine were more subtle.

Danish designer Cecilie Bahnsen, who, in a huge moment for any designer, made her debut at Paris Fashion Week this season, orchestrated a moment of pause at the end of her show. Models stood shoulder to shoulder in what the designer called a ""quiet moment of togetherness,"" during a brief interview backstage.

Later in the week, Stella McCartney -- daughter of Paul McCartney -- closed her show to the music of John Lennon's anti-war song ""Give Peace a Chance,"" and the last look at Nicolas Ghesquière's Louis Vuitton show featured an oversized polo in blue and yellow stripes. He dedicated the show to young people who inspire, ""idealism, hope for the future, for a better world.""

Petar Petrov, a Vienna-based designer who was born in Ukraine (he left at a young age, moving to Bulgaria with his family) was also in Paris to present his latest collection. Speaking the day after he unveiled his new garments via a short video, he chose his words carefully when reflecting on the industry's response. ""We're not politicians,"" he said, saying there's only so much that fashion designers, particularly the smaller, independent houses like his, can do to help. His company announced it would donate 10% of profits from online orders to the UN Refugee Agency and Caritas.

Quiet moments stood out

Of the shows that didn't make any obvious gestures, the quieter, more thoughtful collection unveilings stood out and felt better aligned with the overarching mood.

Petrov's new collection was filled with beautifully crafted wardrobe staples made for women looking to buy pieces they can wear for years to come, regardless of shifting trends. He told CNN he had spoken to friends of the brand who said, ""we are real women, we know who we are and we need products that we love and that we want to wear more than once."" This approach is a more ""quiet way of dressing,"" he said, but ""it's also more relevant."" He believes people became accustomed to comfortable clothing during the pandemic and now they don't want to compromise on this comfort, even when dressing up and wearing more high fashion pieces.

At Chloé, Uruguayan creative director Gabriela Hearst, one of fashion's most dedicated climate activists, presented her collection in a large greenhouse-like structure. An enormous light set up outside shone down on the space, like the sun, possibly in reference to global warming. The collection was a display of earthy tones -- black, browns, reds and citrus shades. And in what is becoming a signature move, the brand released a fact sheet detailing information about where materials are sourced from and how its products are created. This season, for example, 56% of the collection was made using what they call ""lower impact materials"" including recycled cashmere.

Summing up the week, Toledano said he believed the brands took a respectful approach. It was not the ""festive"" atmosphere he had worried about on the eve of fashion week.

When asked about fashion's place in a world filled with conflict and crisis, Toledano said that the industry is filled with ""sensitive people,"" starting with the designers, who feel things deeply.

One such designer is Pierpaolo Piccioli, Valentino's lauded creative head who presented a simple yet radical idea -- an all-pink collection, focused on silhouettes above all else finding ""expressive possibilities in the apparent lack of possibilities,"" according to show notes.

Before the models stepped out onto the pink runway, Piccioli's voice filled the room as he read a statement to the audience. ""It was a hard week, it is a hard moment. We reacted the only way we know -- by working. We reacted by not feeling paralyzed by war, trying to remember that the privilege of our freedom is now bigger than ever. Our thoughts go to those who are suffering, we see you, we feel you, we love you."" He concluded his remarks by saying ""love is the answer, always.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/paris-fashion-week-highlights-fw-2022/index.html
459,The art world responds to Russian invasion of Ukraine by canceling shows and cutting ties,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Oscar Holland, CNN

Stage curtains are closing, art exhibitions are being halted and performers are being replaced. Over the past month, major cultural players worldwide -- including some within Russia -- have reacted to the invasion of Ukraine by canceling shows and applying pressure to the country's art institutions. So far, more than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine as the Kremlin continues its assault on the country's most populated cities, including the capital, Kyiv.

While much of the focus has turned to sanctions meant to cripple Russia's economy, the country's cultural influence is also being curtailed. Russia will no longer be represented at major international events like the Venice Biennale and the televised music competition, Eurovision. Artists and performers, from Iggy Pop to Franz Ferdinand, are also canceling shows in the country, while those who have expressed support for President Vladmir Putin are being shunned. In Germany, the Russian chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, Valery Gergiev, was fired for his refusal to condemn the war or Putin, with whom he has close ties, according to a statement from Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter.

Ukraine's minister of culture, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has joined a group of Ukrainian artists, gallery owners, actors, musicians and film directors in demanding stronger, sweeping cultural sanctions. They have signed a petition calling on international institutions to cancel cultural partnerships with the Russian Federation, sever relationships with Russian nationals sitting on advisory boards and ban Russian participation in major art events, including Art Basel and the Cannes Film Festival.

""The Russian Federation is a rogue state,"" reads the petition. ""Russian culture, when used as propaganda, is toxic! Don't be an accomplice!""

But some are cautioning against culturally isolating all Russians over the war. Raimundas Malašauskas, who was set to curate the Russian pavilion at April's Venice Biennale, pulled out of the event, but said he doesn't want the art world to turn its back on Russian artists.

""I explicitly oppose the current assault and subjugation commanded by Russia. I also believe that people from Russia should not be bullied or cast away solely due to their country's oppressive policies and actions,"" he said in a statement on his website. ""I want to avoid flat-falling divisions, and instead advocate for multi-leveled forms of solidarity where there are international forums for art and artists from Russia to express the freedom that they can't express at home.""

Below are some of the ways that artists, cultural organizations and institutions are reacting to the war in Ukraine.

Russia will be absent from the Venice Biennale

When Malašauskas and Russian artists Alexandra Sukhareva and Kirill Savchenkov resigned from participating in the Venice Biennale, they effectively canceled the Russian Federation's representation at one of the biggest and most prestigious art gatherings in the world.

The Russian pavilion, designed by architect Alexey Shchusev, has been a permanent fixture in Venice Giardini since 1914, opening its doors every two years to showcase the work of some of the country's most important contemporary artists.

In a statement, the Biennale expressed its ""complete solidarity for this noble act of courage."" Savchenkov, who works in sculpture, installation and performance art, meanwhile wrote on Instagram that ""there is no place for art when civilians are dying under the fire of missiles, when citizens of Ukraine are hiding in shelters and when Russian protesters are getting silenced.""

The fate of the Biennale's Ukrainian pavilion was also unclear after the curators posted an official statement on Instagram on February 24 explaining that all work on the exhibition has ceased. But on March 8, they provided an update saying they would continue with the exhibition after evacuating parts of the artwork from Kyiv.

""In times like this, the representation of Ukraine at the exhibition is more important than ever. When the sheer right to existence for our culture is being challenged by Russia, it is crucial to demonstrate our achievements to the world,"" the curators said in the statement.

The Metropolitan Opera won't work with pro-Putin artists

The most famous opera house in the US, New York's Metropolitan Opera, announced on February 27 that it will not work with Russian artists or organizations that support President Vladimir Putin until the country's invasion of Ukraine ends.

""While we believe strongly in the warm friendship and cultural exchange that has long existed between the artists and artistic institutions of Russia and the United States, we can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him -- not until the invasion and killing has been stopped, order has been restored and restitutions have been made,"" said Peter Gelb, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, in a video message shared on Facebook.

This means that the Met will likely freeze its relationship with Moscow's Bolshoi Theater, whose coproduction of Wagner's ""Lohengrin"" is currently planned for next year. On March 3, the opera house announced that famed Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, who was set to play the title role in Puccini's ""Turandot"" at the Met later this spring, will not return for this season or the following. She has now pulled out of all scheduled performances, according to a statement from the Zurich Opera House, where she was scheduled to perform this month.

""It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,"" Gelb said in a statement to CNN. ""Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine there was no way forward.""

Earlier in the week, Netrebko wrote on social media that she is ""opposed to this war,"" but ""not a political person."" The Zurich Opera House described her post as a ""positive development,"" but her inability to ""distance herself further from Vladimir Putin"" was incompatible with its own ""decisive condemnation"" of the Russian president's actions.

Russian star ballerina Olga Smirnova quits Bolshoi Ballet

One of the stars of Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet, Olga Smirnova, quit the company on March 16 over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and will instead dance for the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam.

Smirnova, whose grandfather is Ukrainian, wrote on Telegram that she is ""against war with all the fibers of my soul.""

""I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia,"" she wrote in the statement, which was later republished by the Dutch National Ballet. ""I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements. But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after.

""It hurts that people are dying, that people are losing the roofs over their heads or are forced to abandon their homes. And who would have thought a few weeks ago that all of this would happen? We may not be at the epicenter of the military conflict, but we cannot remain indifferent to this global catastrophe.""

The Bolshoi Ballet is one of the oldest ballet companies in the world, responsible for the first ever production of ""Swan Lake,"" among others. But its status as one of the country's greatest cultural symbols is complicated by its entanglement with the Russian government.

Smirnova joined the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in 2011, before taking lead roles in a number of performances, including ""Swan Lake"" and ""Giselle."" She has since toured internationally with the troupe and has appeared as a guest performer for the American Ballet Theatre and the Vienna State Ballet.

In a statement published Wednesday, March 16, the Dutch National Ballet said Smirnova had been ""welcomed with open arms."" She is expected to make her debut there with its staging of ""Raymonda,"" which premieres in early April.

The announcement comes a little over a week after two other Bolshoi members -- Brazilian soloist David Motta Soares and Italian principal dancer Jacopo Tissi -- both announced they were resigning.

Artists and museums cancel exhibitions in Russia

Contemporary Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson, who is known for performance works and video installations that reflect the human condition, pulled his exhibition at Moscow's new GES-2 museum in February. Speaking to CNN via email, he cited the bravery of local Russian artists who have canceled their own shows in response to the war.

""I was following the(ir) example... which is way more dangerous than my cozy stand here in Iceland,"" he said.

Kjartansson, who in 2009 became the youngest artist to represent Iceland at the Venice Biennale, has exhibited at the Barbican in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He believes that artists, curators, collectors and institutions must ""consider every move"" in order to ""stand by"" Ukraine and stand ""against Putin's regime,"" but called for artists themselves to be protected from boycotts.

""Boycott Russian collectors who do not publicly oppose Putin... not Russian artists, (except) those very few that support Putin,"" he said. ""Support Ukrainian artists with residencies in safe countries (and) exhibition platforms, and (do) the same for Russian artists from the opposition.""

Meanwhile, the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, founded by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Russian American art collector Dasha Zhukova, announced that it has postponed all exhibitions until the invasion of Ukraine has ended. This includes halting shows that were already underway, including the work of German artist Anne Imhof and British artist Helen Marten. ""We cannot support the illusion of normality when such events are taking place,"" reads a statement on the museum's website.

Eurovision bars Russia from competing

On February 25, less than a day after the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said it would allow Russia to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest, a popular televised music competition, the organization reversed course. This May, no performers representing the country will be allowed to compete, the EBU confirmed in o a statement released on Friday.

""The decision reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year's Contest would bring the competition into disrepute,"" read the statement.

Russia had yet to select an act to perform on its behalf at the annual competition, which was watched by 183 million people last year.

UK distances itself from Russian ballet

The UK's Royal Opera House (ROH) has canceled a residency by Moscow's famed Bolshoi Ballet company. The residency had been scheduled for this summer and was in the ""final stages"" of planning, according to a statement provided to CNN. A spokesperson for the ROH said: ""Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, the season cannot now go ahead.""

The company's former artistic director Alexei Ratmansky, who is now an artist-in residence at the American Ballet Theatre, had been working on a new performance for his former company in Moscow when Russia invaded Ukraine. The Russian-born choreographer, who was raised in Kyiv, has since departed for New York with his entire creative team, according to the New York Times.

""I was absolutely torn between creation, love and desperation,"" he told the Times of his decision to leave. Ratmansky's new ballet was supposed to open March 30, but has been postponed indefinitely.

Performances by several other Russian ballet companies have also been affected, with shows by the Russian State Ballet of Siberia pulled in the English town of Northampton and a performance of Swan Lake by the Royal Moscow Ballet called off in Dublin, Ireland.

The European Film Academy boycotts Russian films

The Ukranian Film Academy has set up a public petition calling for the international boycott of Russian cinema, including showings on the international film circuit. The European Film Academy (EFA) has responded in support, saying it will exclude Russian entries from the European Film Awards.

""The European Film Academy remains a place to support and unite all filmmakers who share our belief in human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, and human rights,"" the EFA said in a statement . ""We acknowledge and appreciate those brave filmmakers in Russia who stand up against this war. But in view of a brutal and unjustified attack, we have to stand with our sisters and brothers in Ukraine whose lives are at risk.""

Within the film festival circuit, however, responses have been mixed. The Stockholm International Film Festival has said it will ban films funded by the Russian government. But the Venice Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival -- two of the most prestigious cinema gatherings -- have stopped short of excluding any Russian films or filmmakers. Instead, both festivals will bar any Russian officials or institutions from attending, as well as anyone with ties to the Kremlin.

""Unless the war of assault ends in conditions that will satisfy the Ukrainian people, it has been decided that we will not welcome official Russian delegations nor accept the presence of anyone linked to the Russian government,"" notes the statement from Cannes, which was posted to its website on Tuesday.

""However, we would like to salute the courage of all those in Russia who have taken risks to protest against the assault and invasion of Ukraine. Among them are artists and film professionals who have never ceased to fight against the contemporary regime, who cannot be associated with these unbearable actions, and those who are bombing Ukraine.""

Russian oligarchs step down from top art institutions

Cultural institutions are under growing pressure to cut ties with Russian oligarchs. In February, British parliamentarian Chris Bryant called on UK gallery group Tate to revoke the honorary member status of Russian billionaire and Putin associate Viktor Vekselberg, reported the Guardian. A spokesperson for Tate told CNN that Vekselberg donated seven years earlier and ""there is no ongoing connection,"" adding that there are ""no UK sanctions on any of Tate's supporters."" But on March 14, Artnet reported that Tate had revoked the title, and had also severed ties with Petr Aven, who heads Alfa-Bank in Russia and is sanctioned by the EU.

On March 1, the Royal Academy of Arts announced that Aven had stepped down as a trustee of the Royal Academy Trust. The arts institution said in a statement to CNN that it had also returned Aven's donation toward the ""Francis Bacon: Man and Beast"" exhibition, which is currently on view through mid-April.

The Guggenheim in New York has lost a benefactor as well: Trustee Vladimir Potanin has stepped down, according to the museum. The oligarch has been a longtime supporter of the museum and funded its current exhibition about Russian abstract pioneer Wassily Kandinsky, which is running until this fall.

""Vladimir Potanin has advised the Board of Trustees of his decision to step down as Trustee effective immediately. The Guggenheim accepts this decision and thanks Mr. Potanin for his service to the Museum and his support of exhibition, conservation and educational programs,"" a spokesperson for the Guggenheim said in an email to CNN. ""The Guggenheim strongly condemns the Russian invasion and unprovoked war against the government and people of Ukraine.""

This story will be updated as developments happen.

460,"In today's India, clothing choices signal a deepening religious divide","Rhea Mogul , CNN Written by

In a video that has since gone viral on social media, a group of men gather on a dusty street in India's southern Karnataka state.

Carrying saffron-colored flags and matching scarves, the men chant loudly in unison as they taunt their targets: Muslim women in hijabs who remain huddled in one corner of the street.

The visual confrontation between their black and blue Islamic garments and the raging sea of saffron -- a color closely associated with Hinduism -- is symbolic of deepening divisions in the country caused, in part, by the rise of Hindu nationalism.

What started in January as a peaceful demonstration by six Muslim students protesting for the right to wear hijabs in their state-run school has morphed into a larger movement defined by gender, religion and clothing. And the arrival, weeks later, of counter demonstrators clad in saffron is indicative of the blurring lines between the Indian state and religion.

The orange-yellow hue, seen as a symbol of divinity in Hinduism, has been brazenly adopted by the far-right Hindutva movement and, in recent years, increasingly politicized. The movement seeks to homogenize Indian culture around Hindu values.

For India's Muslims, meanwhile, the hijab has become a symbol of resistance against the wave of Islamophobia spreading across the country, as women wearing the religious garment protest in various towns and cities in support of the students.

""I started covering my head three years ago as a protest against crimes against Muslims,"" said 23-year-old Muslim activist Afreen Fatima in a phone interview. She had been demonstrating in her hometown of Allahabad in northern Uttar Pradesh state.

""But now, it has become a spiritual obligation for me. It's an assertion of my identity. I am an Indian Muslim and I'm not going anywhere.""

A symbol of resistance

The hijab, an Islamic headscarf, is worn by millions of Muslim women around the world as a sign of modesty and privacy. But in some countries the garment has proven controversial, with critics depicting it as a symbol of oppression or arguing that it is incompatible with secular values.

In 2004 the French government banned religious garments , including the hijab, in state schools. Seven years later France became the first country in Europe to ban all face-covering garments in public spaces, with policymakers describing the move a matter of national identity and security.

Other European countries have since followed suit with similar restrictions, though the types of veil permitted -- and where they can be worn -- differ.

In India, however, the hijab is neither banned nor restricted in public spaces, and the right to practice one's faith is guaranteed under the country's secular constitution. But, like elsewhere in the world, Muslim women can face backlash and discrimination for choosing to wear one.

According to Indian poet and activist Nabiya Khan, Muslim women are ""imagined in an Islamic veil and seen as submissive"" because they do not ""fit the feminist narrative of the liberal elite.""

""I wear (a) hijab because I want to,"" she said via WhatsApp. ""It serves me a religious and spiritual significance. It brings me closer to my god.""

The conflict in Karnataka began after a small group of hijabi students were denied entry to their classrooms in the coastal city of Udupi, according to the petition they later filed in the state's top court. In early January, the girls staged a protest outside their government-run school, demanding they be allowed inside. But their teachers refused.

Their demonstration prompted rival protests from right-wing Hindus carrying saffron scarves and flags (such as those captured in the aforementioned video), chanting a religious Hindu slogan in support of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and demanding the girls remove their head coverings.

The clashes proliferated through Karnataka, with the state ordering a three-day closure of all high schools and colleges in early February. Authorities in the state's capital, Bengaluru, also banned protests outside schools for two weeks.

Karnataka's education minister B.C. Nagesh said he supported banning the hijab in educational institutions. Citing the state's mandate on religious attire, the CNN affiliate CNN News-18 that Karnataka's government ""is very firm that the school is not a platform to practice dharma (religion).""

But activists say the hijab row runs deeper than a dress code, claiming it's just the latest in a wider crackdown on India's minority Muslim population since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP came to power almost eight years ago.

The BJP did not respond to CNN's request for comment or to allegations that it advocates Hindu nationalism and is using the hijab row for political gain. When asked about the hijab controversy during a meeting with reporters in February, India's Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, told CNN the matter was for Karnataka's government to handle.

Karnataka has already passed legislation that, critics say, is rooted in Hindutva ideology. Last year, the state banned the sale and slaughter of cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus. It also introduced a controversial anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.

For Fatima, the hijab row is just the latest move from authorities to quell Muslim voices.

""This movement is us fighting for our faith, identity and religious freedom,"" she said. ""By wearing our hijab and taking this stand, we are telling Hindus that we are not going to back down.""

In one of the most striking scenes from the February stand-off, a hijab-wearing Muslim student, Muskan Khan, does exactly that. In another video, which also went viral , Khan is seen being accosted by men as she gets off her scooter to hand in a school assignment.

They heckle her, demanding she take off her hijab. But instead of complying, Khan shouts back ""Allahu Akbar"" -- meaning ""God is great"" in Arabic -- and punches her fist in the air.

Her raised fist has become an icon of defiance. In an act of solidarity, scores of Muslim women have changed their Twitter profile photos to a silhouette of Khan's raised fist, while her likeness has appeared on placards and posters at demonstrations.

Ashish Bagchi is one of many designers and artists who have shared illustrations inspired by Khan on social media. His image depicts her walking with her head held high as saffron-tinted arms -- representative of the Hindu right -- encroach on her.

Bagchi's personal political works, which appear on his Instagram and Twitter, present a narrative of India's shrinking freedoms.

""What really moved me was the way she stood her ground,"" he said. ""What stood out for me was those men shouting and brandishing her with their saffron stoles. Sadly, the saffron color now symbolizes a particular political ideology.""

The politicization of color

The color saffron has roots in Hinduism -- one of the world's oldest religions -- and represents peace. About 80% of India's 1.3 billion people are Hindu, and the color is seen draped on idols in the temples, tied around the neck of cows and used as street decorations during festivals.

But ever since the BJP swept to power with a Hindu nationalist agenda in 2014, the color has become increasingly politicized. Modi and his compatriots are often seen donning saffron-hued clothing and accessories at election rallies, while supporters wave the party's flag (which is primarily saffron) or other similarly colored ones.

""The appropriation of saffron is a way of signaling that the party is not just political, but deeply rooted in religion,"" said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at India's Ashoka University, in a phone interview.

""The color serves the purpose of a 'uniform' and gives BJP supporters a sense of unity and commonality.""

The BJP's Yogi Adityanath , Chief Minister of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, is one high-profile figure who is almost always seen dressed head-to-toe in the color. Arguably one of the most polarizing figures in Indian politics, Adityanath -- a former Hindu priest -- is known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims.

And while not every Hindu that wears the color espouses Hindu nationalism, when politicians dressed in saffron make statements against the country's minorities , it emboldens far-right groups to do the same, according to historian Aditya Mukherjee.

""The religious symbolism used by the Hindu right today is a complete inversion of what Indian culture is. They have given the color a different meaning,"" said Mukherjee.

""This is not what the Hindu religion stands for. And it's certainly not an organic feeling coming from many Hindu Indians.

""It is a very scary moment for India,"" he added, referring to how extremists have carried out violent attacks against Muslims.

It is symbolic, perhaps, that as saffron becomes an increasingly common sight in public life, the hijab's status in India has now been thrown into question. Karnataka's High Court has finished deliberating over whether schools can ban headscarves or not, and a ruling is expected soon. In the meantime, its interim order to prohibit all religious clothing in educational institutes with an existing dress code or uniform, still stands.

For the activist Fatima, removing the hijab is ""like asking our women to strip.""

""It is fathomably disturbing. It is unethical,"" she said, adding that she will not be ""silenced"" by the growing Hindu right.

""The options we as Muslims have to demand justice are very few. Muslim women have it worse. We don't have the privilege to remain silent. We will assert our identity even more.""

461,Milan Fashion Week: Celeb-packed shows and bombastic sets,"With all the usual mainstays holding court, Milan was back with its pre-Covid luster. The ambitious line-up provided a mix of styles, themes and aesthetics.

Like London before it , Milan Fashion Week returned with beautiful in-person shows, plenty of influencers and A-listers in attendance and collections that spanned high glamour and sure-fire commercial hits.

Gucci showed in the city for the first time since February 2020, Prada included Kim Kardashian among its guests (a hint to a future collaboration?) and a red-haired Kendall Jenner walked the catwalk for Bottega Veneta as new creative director Matthieu Blazy unveiled his vision for the brand

Giorgio Armani, who had canceled two events in Milan in January due to surging Covid-19 cases, held shows for both Emporio Armani and his eponymous brand. The latter event on Sunday was the only major show to pay tribute to Ukraine, with the designer sending models down a silent runway as ""a sign of respect towards the people involved in the unfolding tragedy,"" he explained on Instagram.

Elsewhere, however, the lack of visible solidarity -- or any acknowledgment of Russia's invasion, which began a day after shows got underway -- was perhaps the week's biggest shortcoming. In its happy bubble, Milan felt a little tone-deaf considering the realities unfolding in eastern Europe.

Below are more takeaways from the week-long fashion bonanza.

With all the usual mainstays holding court, including Prada, Fendi, Moschino, Armani, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana, Milan was back with its pre-Covid luster. The ambitious line-up (there were 67 physical shows scheduled) provided a mix of styles, themes and aesthetics.

Fendi opened the week with a chic display of tweed and chiffon -- plus Bella Hadid as the show lead and a bevy of influencers sitting front row. It was a collection of contrasts and archival references (creative director Kim Jones drew inspiration from the brand's Spring-Summer 1986 and Fall-Winter 2000 designs), as well as ""It"" bags to accompany the looks.

Contrast was also the watchword for Prada, where Raf Simons and Miuccia Prada cleverly mixed the classics -- from white tanks to aviator jackets -- with showstopping tailored coats and delicately embroidered skirts.

At Max Mara, the brand's signature teddy bear coat was reinvented as huge skirts, dresses and track shorts and then presented alongside floor-length puffer jackets and balaclavas in a street style-meets-alpine slopes kind of way. It was a versatile, highly wearable mix that worked.

Set designs were as thought-out as the clothes at many of this season's shows.

Real-life Dolce & Gabbana models walked against a virtual backdrop of neon skyscrapers, scantily clad digital avatars and D&G graffiti. Diesel had giant inflatable dolls, dressed of course in the brand's clothes, lining a red-hot runway in provocative poses. Jil Sanders opted for replicas of ancient Greek statues placed at the center of her set, while Donatella Versace chose a reflective runway with movable side panels, creating a game of optical illusions.

And then there was Gucci, which welcomed guests into the ultimate trippy setup: a giant room with a black-and-white checkered floor and mirrored walls lit up with violet lights.

The award for most interesting format, though, should probably go to the relatively young brand Sunnei. Doing away with the traditional catwalk, the label held its show en plein air, in the outskirts of Milan, holding what co-founders Simone Rizzo and Loris Messina described as a ""performance within the performance."" Models came running, not walking, along a wall of an industrial building, as the audience -- facing them perched on metal benches -- was invited to watch the show in slow motion on their phones.

New energy

While the heavyweights didn't disappoint sartorially, their casting choices did. Yes, there were racially diverse models -- undoubtedly an important shift from only a few seasons prior -- but, for the most part, they remained skinny and conventionally attractive.

Luckily, new Italian names offered compelling alternatives.

Bright newcomer Marco Rambaldi, in particular, put on one of the week's most talked-about shows with a bold runway that was inclusive, provocative and genuinely fun. Titled ""New Post Romantic Poetics,"" it was live-streamed on Maison Valentino's Instagram account (as part of a partnership between Valentino and Milan Fashion Week organizers) and featured a variety of body types, gender fluid clothes, and a casting of non-professional models, many of which identify as LGBTQ.

Design duo Luca Lin and Galib Gassanoff of Act N.1, another brand to watch from Milan's recent fashion renaissance, meanwhile casted trans people, older women and a young mother with her baby, among others.

A celeb-packed affair

Whether it was Julia Fox at Diesel, Kim Kardashian at Prada, Julianne Moore at Bottega Veneta or Rihanna at Gucci, celebrities were back big time at Milan Fashion Week. Some of the events felt more like red carpet award ceremonies than fashion shows, with hordes of people and paparazzi waiting outside each venue to catch a glimpse of A-list stars.

Gucci did it again

Gucci is no stranger to collabs, having recently worked with the likes of Balenciaga and The North Face. But the partnership it unveiled at ""Exquisite Gucci,"" the title of its Fall-Winter show, might just be its biggest commercial hit yet. In collaboration with Adidas, the label sent out models in berets, jackets and giant leather bags bearing mash-ups of the two brands' logos, proving just how good creative director Alessandro Michele is at his job: making the label a harbinger of cool.

Prepare to see these designs on hypebeasts everywhere.

Back to the office

Designers seemed to embrace the return-to-office trend that is gaining traction in some parts of the world, with tailored suiting a recurrent sartorial choice at Milan Fashion Week.

Gucci based a whole collection on it, putting forth a range that included slim-fit and double-breasted looks, as well as a standout velvet tuxedo with crystal detailing and sequins. Bottega Veneta had a minimal take on the two-piece for men and women alike, while both Versace and Dolce & Gabbana opened their collections with a strong shouldered suit. Prada's structural suit jackets, too, were right on the money.

In a complete antithesis to suits and pretty dresses, Jeremy Scott's Moschino delivered the week's most surreal show -- and one of his campest collections to date. The delightfully wacky line up spanned harp gowns and lampshade headpieces, grandfather-clock inspired dresses and slinky ensembles emblazoned with phrases like ""Maid in Italy"" and ""Gilt without Guilt.""

The Hadid sisters walked the runway -- Gigi (pictured top) closed the show in a dramatic gold gown featuring a sweeping tulle train and matching gloves with gold leaves wrapped around the arms. But it was Scott himself that made the splashiest entrance, as he came out to take his bow in a red astronaut suit.

462,"From Queen Victoria to Cardi B, how this legacy watchmaker found itself in the zeitgeist","Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

From Joe DiMaggio to Albert Einstein, Princess Diana to Victoria Beckham, watchmaker Patek Philippe has long been a celebrity favorite. But the Swiss brand's reputation has taken an unexpected turn in recent years.

Namedropping luxury labels may be nothing new in hip-hop, but lyrical references to Patek Phillippe exploded in 2017. That year, one-third of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 mentioned the brand, according to music website Genius.

Travis Scott has rapped about his ""two-tone Patek,"" Cardi B (pictured top) "" flooded "" hers with diamonds and Gucci Mane suggested that his was ""gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me."" Young Thug, Migos and Future have all mentioned their Patek Philippe timepieces, while Lil Uzi Vert has such affinity with the watchmaker that he released two tracks honoring it, ""Patek"" and ""New Patek."" (""New Patek on my wrist,"" he said in the latter, ""white diamonds, them sh**s hit pink."")

The phenomenon coincided with a wider surge of interest in watch collecting, according to Nick Marino, senior vice president of content at online watch magazine, Hodinkee

""Since Patek Phillipe has always has been one of the most prestigious watch brands, it stood to reason that it would be the one that everyone was talking about,"" he said via video call.

""Hip-hop has a long and storied history of shouting out brands that artists like, going back to 'My Adidas' by Run-DMC, and it just so happened that watches caught fire.

""Rappers are smart,"" he added. ""They know what status means and they know what exclusivity means. You might expect rappers to talk about Richard Mille, because that's a young, flashy, 'new money' watch brand -- and rappers love that one too -- but I love that they love the old-money watch brands.

""By positioning themselves as Patek customers, rappers are positioning themselves in the lineage of elites going all the way back to the 19th century. That's power.""

The brand's place in pop culture is a far cry from its 1990s ""Generations"" ads, which featured predominantly White parents and their children bonding over treasured horological heirlooms. The memorable campaign helped establish the famous catchphrase, ""You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.""

As a brand that promotes history and heritage as markers of quality, becoming a status symbol for the Instagram generation might have sat uncomfortably with the 182-year-old company. But, Marino said, the watchmaker has not visibly repositioned its brand -- nor need it worry about becoming too popular: ""In a lot of ways, the young audience -- the hip-hop audience -- has found Patek maybe rather than the other way around.

""This brand has been a symbol of luxury since 1839, so I don't think there's any danger of them being seen as a flash in the pan,"" he said, adding: ""Twenty-seventeen was a lifetime ago in hip-hop, and people are still talking about these watches.""

Indeed, according to Sharon Chan, director of watches at Bonhams auction house in Hong Kong, Patek Philippe's place in the zeitgeist is ""a very positive sign"" for its future.

""Five to eight years ago, Patek Philippe watches were mostly bought by older clients,"" she said over the phone. ""But recently, it's all the younger generation -- the second or third generation (down) from the first collector clients we had.

""Their collecting style and the types (of watches they're interested in) are quite different. In the past, experienced collectors looked for the most complicated versions of products. Nowadays, they tend to go for simpler functions -- something simple-looking or made from different materials. Whereas in the past 80% of our Patek Philippe watches we sold were (made from) precious metals, now, most customers are requesting the stainless-steel ones.""

""Rarely, do (the watches) really just go down to the next generation,"" she added. ""But it is a brand that connects the generations together.""

More money, fewer complications

Celebrities' fixation with Patek Philippe may just reflect its status as the world's most expensive watchmaker -- if auction records are your measure, at least. The brand is responsible for eight of the 10 priciest watches ever to go under the hammer, including a stainless-steel Reference 1518 that fetched over 11 million Swiss francs ($11.1 million) and a pink gold version that smashed estimates to sell for almost $9.6 million last September.

($31.2 million). Considered among the most complicated mechanical watches ever produced, the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication became the world's most expensive timepiece when it sold for 23.2 million Swiss francs ($24 million) in 2014. That record was comprehensively smashed five years later by an unworn Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime 6300A-010, created especially for a charity auction in Geneva, that fetched 31 million Swiss francs

Founded in Geneva as Patek, Czapek & Cie (the current name was adopted after Polish co-founder Antoni Norbert Patek partnered with Frenchman Adrien Philippe), the brand claims to have been making watches ""without interruption"" since 1839. Queen Victoria was among the watchmaker's early clients, purchasing one of its ""keyless"" watches -- the first in the world to operate without prior winding -- at London's Great Exhibition in 1851.

New technology would continue underpinning Patek Philippe's appeal among the era's rich and famous. In 1868, the company produced what it believes to be the world's first wristwatch for the Hungarian Countess Koscowicz (a claim hotly disputed by rival Breguet, which says a 1810 timepiece it made for the Queen of Naples was the world's first). Patek Philippe has since been awarded over 100 patents , from the first perpetual calendar mechanism for pocket watches to ""time zone"" watches that featured a second hour hand for international jet-setters.

But its most exclusive range has proven to be one of its least complicated: the Nautilus.

Designed to resemble a ship's porthole, Nautilus watches cost upwards of $30,000 each, with prices on the secondary market often significantly higher. Following popular ranges like 1932's Calatrava, the collection launched in 1976 and has been worn not only by royalty and rappers, but business moguls, athletes and Hollywood stars.

More recently, Drake has shown off his emerald-laden Patek Philippe Nautilus Reference 5726, custom-designed by late fashion designer Virgil Abloh , while Kylie Jenner is regularly pictured sporting a white gold diamond-encrusted Nautilus Reference 5719. The Nautilus also makes regular appearances on Instagram, ranging from the subtle (see John Mayer wearing his in a mirror selfie ) to the not-so-suble (see reality star Scott Disick waiting outside a then-unopened Patek Philippe store alongside the caption, ""What time ya opening @patekphilippe?"").

It is the stainless-steel Nautilus Reference 5711, in particular, that has acquired cult status in celebrity circles. In 2019, the New York Times reported that only ""carefully vetted clients"" would be added to a waiting list -- after which they would need to wait up to eight years to purchase one.

Then, last year, the company offered an unexpected response to the demand: it discontinued the 5711.

In the aforementioned Times article, company president Thierry Stern, whose family has run the watchmakers since 1932, suggested that Patek Philippe did not want to be seen as a one-model brand. ""We make about 140 different models at Patek Philippe, and the basic Ref. 5711 in steel is just one of them,"" he was quoted as saying. ""We have many other models that are more complicated and arguably more beautiful.""

The 5711 nonetheless made a brief reappearance in late 2021, with the release of a limited-edition olive-green version and a Tiffany & Co. collaboration in the US jeweler's iconic blue. But -- for now at least -- the model appears to have been scrubbed from the brand's website, where the coveted 5711 is conspicuous by its absence among over 25 other types of Nautilus.

Aura of exclusivity

Waiting lists and soaring resale prices clearly bolster the brand's aura of exclusivity. But the scarcity may be a genuine matter of supply and demand. While Rolex is thought to produce in the region of a million timepieces a year, Patek Philippe's annual output may be as little as 50,000, Chan said.

""Everyone thinks (waiting lists are) a marketing strategy, but because the demand has increased in such short time, they really cannot meet it. Over the past two years, my watch circles are seeing 10 times the normal requests for the Nautilus or the Aquanaut,"" she said, referring to another popular range launched in 1997.

""That's just my little circle, so can you imagine, all around the world, how many people are trying to get one or two or three for themselves?""

If the watchmaker were to ramp up production, it might come at the cost of quality, which could itself threaten the brand, added Hodinkee's Marino.

""What any elite watchmaker will tell you is that they produce as many as they can to maintain the level of quality that their customers expect,"" he said. ""Now, could Patek produce a ton more watches and put their name on it? They could. But then it wouldn't be Patek anymore. The limited nature and the craftsmanship is what you're paying for to begin with.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/patek-philippe-celebrity-popular-culture/index.html
463,A prosthetic forehead and a puppeteered appendage: Behind the making of 'Pam and Tommy',"Written by Leah Dolan, CNN

Keeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.

When a trailer for the new Hulu series ""Pam & Tommy"" dropped in November, screenshots of Lily James' mesmerizing transformation into the ""Baywatch"" icon Pamela Anderson immediately went viral.

""I don't know what the actual movie is gonna be like, but the make-up artists should receive a freaking Oscar,"" read one top YouTube comment . Others took to Twitter to express their utter disbelief at the likeness: ""Lily James EMBODYING Pamela Anderson. The hair and makeup department definitely is getting paid bc woah now!""

Out today, the show -- which also stars Sebastian Stan as Anderson's ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee -- chronicles the sex-tape scandal of the late 1990s that turned the then-couple's lives upside-down. At the time of that infamous invasion of privacy, Anderson's particular brand of beauty was already unmistakable.

Pencil-thin brows accentuated with pearlescent highlighter, lips plumped by mauve-colored liner and eyes ringed in smoky kohl: This has been the signature look that has come to define her style for decades.

The makeup, the California blonde hair and her famously curvaceous figure is the look of a bombshell -- a label some might find outdated, but it's a term the model and actor has proudly embraced. ""It's all about bringing back the bombshell,"" Anderson told Harpers Bazaar in 2016

""Everyone wants natural beauty, but natural beauty still takes an hour and a half, so you might as well have fun with it. I'm not into the grunge, I-don't-give-a-crap look. I want to look like a woman.""

""Pam & Tommy"" meticulously remakes James in Anderson's image, even trying to replicate minute details such as Anderson's hair texture fresh out of the shower. ""This is a transformation beyond transformation,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""Can you believe this is Lily James?""

Stars in silhouette

The metamorphosis was the work of a team led by award-winning visuals experts, including the head of makeup David Williams, hair department head Barry Lee Moe and special makeup effects designer, Jason Collins. ""When those first images hit the internet, it was validation for something that we were already feeling was happening,"" Williams said in a video interview. ""Certain projects have kinetic energy about them. That's undeniable. And this is one of those shows.""

Research was the foundation of their efforts. The team began by trawling through the extensive collection of paparazzi photos taken of Anderson over the years to nail down Andersons' ""silhouette.""

""The silhouette is everything,"" Collins said during the same video call, for which Moe was also present. ""You don't want to do a caricature. That's the worst thing that you could possibly do. You want to try to find a natural median between the two actresses.""

It took around four hours each day to get James into character, using a combination of 15 pairs of lace eyebrows, four wigs, two rows of hand-sculpted dentures, a breast plate and a prosthetic forehead -- and that's before Williams could even think about recreating Anderson's makeup.

""Finding the essence of Pam was such a trial and error experience for us,"" Moe said. ""We did a lot of tests in the beginning, scaling (James' hair and makeup) down as the day went on to see how little we could get away with. (But) when we removed all of the appliances on the face and just had Lily in a wig and paint, it was Lily in a wig and paint.""

While many know Anderson for her voluptuous physique, it was the prosthetic forehead that turned out to be the bedrock of James' transformation.

""The forehead was really where we planted our flag,"" Collins said. It was the missing piece of the puzzle: Anderson had more ""real estate"" up there than James, Williams added, meaning everything from Moe's painstakingly crafted wigs to the wafer-thin eyebrows Williams created sat more convincingly with that addition.

Moe, Collins and Williams believed that production indulging them in all the aesthetic bells and whistles not only made their job easier (""The devil is in the details, and we were three little devils,"" Williams said, chuckling.), it had a palpable impact on the actors, too. James kept her custom-made dentures in all day, according to Collins, which improved her grasp of Anderson's diction. Similarly, a Brazilian straightening treatment on Stan's real hair allowed him to ""live and breathe"" Tommy Lee, Moe said.

""From the time he woke up in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he wanted to carry that hair with him,"" Moe added.

Devil in the details

For the rest of Stan's transformation into the Mötley Crüe drummer, research was equally granular. No detail was overlooked, unless the team were contractually obliged to overlook it. ""We can't for legal purposes use (Lee's) exact tattoos, so we do slight alterations to them,"" Williams explained.

To recreate Lee's extensive body art, the team created a chronological timeline of every tattoo he had ever gotten. ""But some of those tattoos are incomplete, they're being worked on. Like the ""Mayhem"" on his chest, in the wedding photos, only half of it's there,"" Collins said. ""So in the end, you have to get together with everybody and decide what our tattoos are going to be, and what are we going to stick with for the point of storytelling.""

Once the designs were selected, Stan was taken in for a 3D body scan to figure out how they would fit Lee's 6'2"" tattoo proportions on Stan's 5'11"" frame. Overall, it took three hours each morning to transfer around 35 individual temporary tattoos onto the actor's body.

The final, and somewhat surprising, building block was a hollowed-out prosthetic penis animated by two puppeteers. Early on in the series, Lee and his appendage have an extended conversation, arguing over whether he and Anderson should abstain (days) until marriage.

The surreal interaction was actually lifted from Lee's 2005 memoir ""Tommyland,"" writer Robert Siegel told Variety , in which Lee recounts confessing his feelings for Anderson out loud, to his penis.

""When David and I first read the script, I believe I called Dave and I said, 'You think they're gonna keep this thing?'"" Collins recalled.

""My words were, 'This could be really great. Or this could be a dumpster fire,'"" Williams added.

The writers needed to tread carefully, considering neither Lee nor Anderson gave Hulu their permission to produce the biopic. But by the time they had shot the scene, the team was grateful for the fantasy element offered by the talking penis. ""I like the choice of our creators to go in that direction,"" Collins said. ""As opposed to some salacious version of focusing on what was actually on the (leaked sex) tape. This was a much smarter way to understand this (sexual) element exists.""

While Lee is reportedly "" cool "" with the adaptation, Anderson has yet to comment on the series.

""I hope that if she does choose to watch or sees pieces of it, she will see the care that was taken by Lily to be the steward of her story,"" Williams said.

""If we could say anything to Pam,"" Moe added, ""it'd be that, we love you, Pam, and we thank you. She changed the landscape in so many ways, from beauty trends to all the work that she does with her animal rights activism. And I think (being able) to honor a woman like Pam was such a blessing. To be a part of telling that story.""

Add to queue: Best biopic transformations

Nicole Kidman was plastered in a combination of prosthetics, false eyebrows and 1950s-inspired makeup to recreate American actress Lucille Ball in the biopic released on Amazon Prime last December.

Rami Malek was given a prosthetic nose and hand-crafted teeth to convincingly mimic the appearance of Queen front man Freddie Mercury for the 2018 movie. Prosthetic designer Jan Sewell told Variety there were several false mustaches needed for Malek's version of Mercury, and that she would ""clean and tone"" them every night.

Margot Robbie was slathered in cobalt eyeshadow and intense rouge to help her embody 1980s figure skater Tonya Harding. Makeup department head Deborah La Mia Denaver even used a method called ""reverse contouring,"" which uses highlight instead of shadow, to make Robbie's face appear wider and less defined.

464,Can seaweed help solve the world's plastic crisis?,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

After you finish your fries, eat the ketchup packet. When you add your pasta to boiling water, toss the bag into the pot, too.

If these instructions sound confusing to you, it's only because you haven't yet heard of Notpla, a London-based startup company that is designing a seaweed-based replacement for single-use plastic packaging. Founded in 2014, the company closed a £10 million ($13.5 million) Series A financing round last month, led by the VC firm Horizons Ventures, to scale and further develop its product line.

Notpla's products are meant to be composted or dissolved after use -- though some are edible, too. Current offerings include sachets for condiments, water and even alcohol; a film wrap for products in your pantry or bathroom, like coffee or toilet paper; and takeaway boxes that replace plastic-based coating with seaweed lining to make them fully biodegradable.

Notpla design director Karlijn Sibbel says they look to nature as inspiration ""for the ideal packaging,"" like the skin on a fruit. ""A peel will eventually be used (as nutrients) by nature, and disappear and become a part of the cycle,"" she said.

The approach feels especially relevant as the world is coming to terms with the effects of decades of unfettered plastic production. According to the UN, 300 million tonnes (331 million tons) of plastic waste are produced globally each year, and out of the estimated 8.3 billion tonnes (9.15 billion tons) of plastic produced since the early 1950s, about 60% has been landfilled or discarded outdoors. Microplastics -- tiny particles that are often the result of larger plastics breaking down -- pollute the ocean, the air and our bodies.

Fruit peels served as inspiration for ""the ideal packaging,"" according to design director Karlijn Sibbel, because they decompose quickly and provide nutrients back to the earth. Credit: David Lineton/Notpla

Over the past few years, there has been a growing movement against single-use plastics as many experts have argued the products are unnecessary and harmful, and businesses have come under fire for using them excessively -- like in 2019, when Whole Foods' peeled and individually wrapped oranges went viral. In the US, some states and municipalities have taken action: New York banned most plastic shopping bags, and in Miami Beach, plastic straws have been outlawed. Overseas, the European Union put a broad ban on single-use plastics into effect this summer, and India plans to follow suit next year, the government announced in August.

""It's getting more and more clear how big the plastic problem is,"" Sibbel said. ""Manufacturers are ""using materials that last for thousands of years,"" she explained, but for products that are only in use ""for a few minutes.""

""That mismatch is something that we need to solve,"" she added.

Rethinking plastic

Notpla's founders, Rodrigo García González and Pierre Paslie, initially looked to seaweed as the solution to the world's plastic problem because it is abundant, grows quickly, doesn't compete with land crops, and sequesters carbon from the air, Sibbel explained.

There are also many different seaweed species, and it can be harvested or farmed. (Notpla uses farmed plants.)

""Seaweed doesn't use land; it doesn't use pesticides,"" Sibbel said. ""It can grow into the ocean and the sea, where it actually has a lot of positive benefits so it can create new ecosystems for other organisms to thrive in.""

This startup makes packaging from seaweed

Since its founding, the startup has been awarded grants from the British government agency Innovate UK and the circular economy nonprofit Ellen MacArthur Foundation for its first product, the Ooho sachet, which holds single servings of liquids. The new financing round will go toward ramping up the production of the Ooho and Notpla coating, while further developing their new seaweed paper and multipurpose film wrap.

The paper is made from the fibers left over from creating other Notpla products and can be used to make items like gift wrap or clothes tags, while the film wrap can hold most dry goods or wet goods with low water content.

""The exciting thing is that this is a film that can replace most of the flexible packaging that you see around,"" Sibbel said. The potential contents could include coffee grounds, toilet paper or the screws included for furniture assembly. For food items, such as pasta, they have even experimented with adding flavors to the packaging, so that dissolving the bag could add seasoning to the skillet.

""You can cook with it. And you can really start to rethink what we can do with these materials,"" she explained.

Industry shifts

Some of Notpla's products are available online, but the company has also landed some major partnerships in the UK and around Western Europe to provide beverages at festivals like DGTL in Amsterdam and Glastonbury in Somerset. In 2019, Notpla distributed 36,000 Oohos filled with the energy drink Lucozade Sport during the London Marathon, and it provided edible Glenlivet capsules at London Cocktail Week.

Last year, the startup tested 30,000 takeaway boxes at different UK restaurants in collaboration with the online food ordering service Just Eat, and plans are underway to offer the boxes around Europe in 2022.

As they scale up, Notpla's team hopes seaweed could replace single-use plastic in the supply chain more broadly, Sibbel said, but with the volume of plastics used around the world, she understands the enormity of such a task.

""I don't think one material (or) one solution is going to solve everything, but we think that seaweed really ticks the right boxes,"" she said.

After the seaweed is stripped of the materials to make Notpla's sachets, films and coatings, the leftover fibers can be used to make paper. Credit: Notpla

Rethinking when and why we used plastic will be crucial to Notpla breaking into other industries, Sibbel said. ""Plastic can do a lot of things,"" she added. But it's about asking, ""Is it really necessary for this application?""

She points to packaging for produce like tomatoes, which have holes to let the food breathe.

""You don't have to have the properties of plastic. Why are we using plastic?"" Sibbel asked, laughing. ""I really hope to see the industry move and also embrace (change) in a positive way.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/notpla-seaweed-single-use-plastics/index.html
465,Digital dress codes: What will we wear in the metaverse?,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

In the near future, instead of going to your closet to choose something to throw on for your next video call, you might instead turn to your virtual wardrobe to pick out a 3D-rendered digital outfit to ""wear.""

At least, that's what a number of people in the fashion and tech space are banking on as more businesses look to the promise of digital fashion. And they're wagering those virtual outfits won't just be for your Zoom calls, but could eventually be worn all over the ""metaverse"" -- the concept of an interlinked extended reality world -- in games, across social media, and eventually, perhaps, viewed on your body in the real world through augmented reality (AR) glasses.

In McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion's annual ""State of Fashion"" report , industry leaders looked ahead to this immersive frontier.

""There are more and more 'second worlds' where you can express yourself (but) there is probably an underestimation of the value being attached to individuals who want to express themselves in a virtual world with a virtual product, (through) a virtual persona,"" Gucci's chief marketing officer Robert Triefus is quoted in the report as saying.

Digital fashion marketplaces have recently opened, including DressX, hoping that shoppers will be keen to start a virtual wardrobe. Credit: DressX

Outfitting our digital personas is nothing new, from making pixelated Dollz in the early 2000s to shopping these days for new wardrobe additions in Animal Crossing. The video game industry has more recently laid the groundwork for digital fashion, with outfits or ""skins,"" in games like Overwatch and Fortnite generating billions in revenue

Some major fashion players have already begun capitalizing on the gaming market -- in 2019, Louis Vuitton designed skins for League of Legends, and Nike and Ralph Lauren have this year offered avatar accessories through the virtual world-building platform Roblox. Outside of gaming environments, NFTs -- or non-fungible tokens , which use blockchain technology to verify ownership of digital assets -- have allowed digital fashion to be monetized more broadly as well. (This fall, Dolce & Gabbana's NFT collection sold out for 1,885.719 ETH, at the time equivalent to $6 million).

At the same time, discussions around virtual worlds have accelerated due to the pandemic and remote working. Facebook's rebranding as "" Meta "" has only spurred more interest. (In a recent keynote for Meta's Connect 2021 conference, Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that we'll have ""a wardrobe of virtual clothes for different occasions"" in the metaverse.)

And without physical runway shows last year, fashion designers were forced to get creative in how they presented their clothes. American luxury label Hanifa put on a digital show that eschewed human models in favor of headless, floating figures wearing 3D-renders of new garments, while Chinese designers Xu Zhi, Andrea Jiapei Li and Roderic Wong presented collections during Shanghai Fashion week through an AR virtual showcase.

""Brands realized that they had to create digital showrooms and digital fashion shows...to sell their collections in 2020,"" said Karinna Grant, who co-founded the NFT fashion marketplace The Dematerialised with Marjorie Hernandez, in a phone call. Because of that, she added, consumers were exposed to new ways of seeing clothes presented digitally.

And, quick as a flash, the first wave of digital fashion marketplaces has already arrived, with sites including Replicant, The Dematerialised and DressX offering varied but still somewhat limited functionality. (Currently the latter overlays the clothes on your submitted photo within 24 hours). Snapchat allows users to ""try on"" digital garments through AR, and Instagram has tested AR clothing filters as well.

Labels like Gucci, Prada, and Rebecca Minkoff are eagerly getting into the space, with Minkoff selling digital versions from her most recent collection on The Dematerialised -- which was priced between 50 euros and 500 euros ($56 to $562) and sold out almost immediately. Just this week Nike announced it had acquired RTFKT, a collective that designs virtual kicks among other digital collectibles.

Replacing the physical

As the field develops, Grant sees three ways of using digital garments: wearing them yourself through AR, outfitting your avatars, and minting them as NFTs to be collected and traded -- the last of which has already seen a boom in the digital art space.

But why should we replace our physical clothes? Proponents say there's unlimited creative expression through digital outfits, which now look increasingly more refined thanks to developments in 3D rendering and AR technology.

""Clothing represents an expression of a personality. It always has in the physical world, and it will in the virtual world,"" said Simon Whitehouse, the former head of label JW Anderson who now helms the sustainability agency Eco Age, in a video call. His artist collective, EBIT, recently launched a mental health-focused game called "" Yellow Trip Road ,"" which includes the ability to purchase digital outfits, called ""Bumper Jumpers,"" as NFTs.

On DressX, shoppers can purchase gravity-defying sci-fi looks from ""tech-couture"" brand Auroboros that might take a fashion house (or a cosplay designer) weeks to engineer physically, with some elements impossible to make at all. In addition, virtual outfits offer a more affordable price point into luxury brands -- like when Gucci launched new digital-only sneakers for $12 this past spring.

""It's like an entry point where you're not spending thousands of dollars, but you can still participate with a brand,"" said Caitlin Monahan, a consumer tech strategist for trend forecasting company WGSN, in a video call.

From the brand side, it's ""incredibly lucrative"" to sell clothes without producing physical garments, she explained. Which, by the same token, means virtual fashion is far more sustainable, as well.

""It's reinventing an entire supply chain,"" Monahan said. ""There's no water usage, there's very limited CO2 emissions. There's no samples being sent out or returns. There's no show rooms, there's no physical prototyping.""

For brands, digital fashion is also ""incredibly lucrative"" as a way to sell apparel without producing physical clothes. Credit: DressX

So far there is limited data about the reduced impact of digital fashion, but according to DressX's 2020 sustainability report , production of a digital garment emits 97% less carbon than a physical garment, and saves 3,300 liters of water per item. The marketplace's founders, Daria Shapovalova and Natalia Modenova, first targeted the influencer industry, since influencers often receive clothes from brands for a single image, but the duo has recently partnered with a number of brands and publishers, including Google Pixel and Vogue Singapore, to introduce the company's capabilities to a bigger audience.

""We're working on popularizing digital fashion and mass adoption for it,"" said Shapovalova in a phone call.

They say an NFT marketplace is also on the horizon for DressX, giving some designs more exclusivity and the ability to collect and sell them on the secondary market. And, though garments minted as NFTs will be less sustainable than non-minted digital garments due to the carbon emissions of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Whitehouse, Grant and Monahan all pointed to more eco-friendly ways of building NFT platforms, such as using blockchains that operate on an allegedly greener ""proof of stake"" system, or offering the ability to pay in fiat money instead of crypto.

""As more and more players get into the market in terms of software, I think even more alternatives will begin to arise,"" Monahan said.

Any adoption of virtual fashion could mean positively impacting an industry that is a major contributor to the world's carbon emissions and microplastic pollution in the ocean -- as long as it is successful in replacing some of the clothes in your closet, and not just an addition.

""We don't need any more physical goods on the planet,"" said Whitehouse. ""Look at what's happening in landfills all over the world. Fashion is...in the top five most polluting industries in the world.""

An interconnected future

As more of the fashion industry dips into the virtual world, the interest in staking a claim in it may, at first, outpace the technology itself. Having a single wardrobe that can be used across multiple gaming environments as well as social media and other platforms will require them to be compatible, explained Irene-Marie Seelig, CEO and co-founder of AnamXR, which designs virtual experiences for brands. Otherwise the digital fur coat you've just purchased won't be able to be worn between applications.

""It's very disconnected at the moment,"" Seelig said over the phone. ""And in the future, I foresee it being a lot more interconnected...where you're able to connect into different metaverses with your avatar, your digital wardrobe.""

Seelig created the Bumper Jumpers from EBIT's Yellow Trip Road using Unreal Engine, a popular game engine that supports console, mobile and desktop gaming, as well as VR. The outfits could conceivably be ported into games, including Fortnite, one day -- if those game developers decide to open that door.

The developers of these ""Bumper Jumpers"" from the gaming experience ""Yellow Trip Road"" hope they will eventually be worn across multiple virtual settings, and not just limited to the game. Credit: EBIT

Some critics are skeptical that there will be a metaverse at all, but if there is, achieving the utopic ""open metaverse"" with a single wardrobe will be challenging for a number of reasons, ranging from the technical -- if some virtual worlds require a particular graphics card or crypto wallet to function, explained Grant -- to broader IP issues. Will tech companies be willing to share the metaverse space?

It's unclear how everything will shake out, but Monahan is optimistic so far on the fashion side of things.

""In my conversations with digital fashion players, everything seems incredibly collaborative...instead of traditional fashion houses being quite private with their product and the research and development,"" she explained.

That leaves it up to consumers to decide whether they see the benefit in ditching their material goods in favor of virtual ones.

""One challenge right now is the attitude shift towards paying for something that isn't tactile,"" Monahan said, recalling the internet reactions to Gucci's cheaper digital-only sneakers. ""There were so many comments...saying, 'This is a scam.' 'This is scary.' 'This is the beginning of human extinction.' There was such a resistance to it.""

But Monahan believes there are enough people who will be keen on the idea to change the tides. She likens the future of virtual fashion to that of streetwear. The hype around the latter has sent sneakers' secondary market soaring -- and enthusiasts collect to display it, not necessarily to wear.

""It's almost like an art piece, something that you have this kind of emotive connection to -- and I think digital fashion works in the same way,"" Monahan said. ""And just because something isn't tactile, it doesn't mean that it lacks value. And I think proving that utility and proving that craftsmanship will really be key to mainstream adoption.""

466,Behold the balaclava: Why a 19th-century army accessory has taken over social media,"Written by Leah Dolan, CNN

Scroll through Instagram, TikTok or Pinterest this winter and you'll see thousands of youthful faces framed inside what looks like an overgrown knitted sock. The balaclava, sometimes called a ski mask, has become an unusual sartorial staple -- and a late entry in the race to claim 2021's hottest fashion trend.

Typically made from wool, mohair or some form of yarn, the headpiece leaves room for a sizable face hole or just for the eyes. On TikTok, at the time of writing, there are 102.6 million videos attached to the hashtag ""#balaclava,"" while another 248,000 people on Instagram have posted about the offbeat accessory. Interest is up on Google too, with the question ""how to knit a balaclava"" growing more than 5000% in the past 12 months -- likely thanks to Gen Z's favorite pandemic hobby

""Recent balaclava designs from the likes of Stella McCartney all the way through to those now on sale at Zara are fueling the demand among all ages,"" said Jessica Payne, Pinterest's head of fashion, over email. She noted searches for balaclavas have jumped 230% since the start of November.

The accessory has become a winter favorite, in part because of its convenience in a mask-mandated world. ""I think (the trend is) 90% due to the fact that people are more comfortable now having part of their face covered,"" commented one user on TikTok. ""This trend fits so well in the pandemic,"" another agreed.

But balaclavas were also a mainstay on the runway this year, from the late Virgil Abloh 's hallucinatory checkerboard-style take on the mask, to Givenchy's avant garde twist featuring knitted devil horns. Keen-eyed fashionistas may also remember the accessory from Miu Miu's Paris Fashion week show this past March, where it appeared alongside slip dresses and snow boots against the backdrop of Italy's Dolomite mountains. Balaclavas have also featured in recent collections by Moschino, Balmain, Marine Serre and Raf Simmons before trickling down into brands like Urban Outfitters and Weekday.

But not every reimagining of the ski mask has been successful. In 2019, Gucci withdrew its controversial ""balaclava jumper"" and issued an apology , after criticisms stating the black and red design resembled blackface.

Post-Soviet style

So, where did the balaclava come from and how did it capture the imagination of some of the industry's biggest designers?

Historically, the balaclava is more often associated with war tactics than runway trends. These masks take their name from the Ukrainian port town of Balaclava, the backdrop for a battle in 1854 during the Crimean War, where British and Irish troops were sent to fight Russian soldiers in freezing conditions. Morale during the war was low, not least because the UK army arrived with nothing but their worn-out summer uniform. When news of this scandalous lack of supplies traveled back to the UK, British women began knitting full-face hats for their men and shipping them out to the barracks.

The knitted headgear has since become symbolic of the eastern European militia after being used by pro-Russian separatist demonstrators to avoid surveillance. To many, they read as markers of threatening, anti-conformist behavior, but in recent years, more whimsical connections have been made, with candy-colored and bunny-eared versions easily found.

But the balaclava is just one example of fashion inspiration recently drawn from the Eastern Bloc. In 2017, young Russian designer Gosha Rubchinskiy was considered one of the most exciting names in menswear for his designs reimagining post-Soviet youth culture: sparse, minimalist tracksuit sets emblazoned with nothing but large logos from 90s zeitgeist brands (think FILA and Kappa) and cyrillic phrases.

According to Rachel Tashjian, GQ's resident fashion critic, the balaclava bubble likely started around this time in 2018 thanks to luxury streetwear label Vetements, co-founded by Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia (known as Demna), who also leads creative direction at Balenciaga. (At the Met Gala this fall, Demna dressed Kim Kardashian West in a black bodysuit and full face mask). At the time, Vetements released a collection accessorized with militant balaclavas and florid silk scarves wrapped around baseball caps.

It was ""eastern European style with a 20-year delay,"" Tashjian said via email. ""The attitude of the collection was equal parts menacing and grandma-like, the result of rebuilding flea market garments from other periods into something new.""

There's no denying we're experiencing a resurgence in appreciation for Slavic style, with searches for the phrase ""Russian aesthetic"" peaking on Pinterest in the UK the week of December 7 alone. Nostalgia for post-Soviet culture has also been brewing on social media for the past two years. The hashtag #sovietaesthetic has 4.7 million views on TikTok, filled with videos of young teenagers romanticizing the Brutalist architecture and imagined melancholic ambiance of life after the fall of USSR. Many of the videos were scored by Belarusian synth-pop trio Molchat Doma, who in 2020 shot to fame when their music went viral on the app overnight.

As for the bulky knitted garment currently holding your Instagram feed hostage, it may stick around for the foreseeable future. According to TikTok influencer and trend forecaster Mandy Lee, it ticks multiple boxes, from the ""approachable trend"" of DIY knitwear, to looking either ""apocalyptic"" or ""glamorous,"" depending on how it's styled, she said in a video on the app. It's also highly functional in lieu of a winter hat and scarf, she added, which could help extend its lifespan.

""Usually trends that serve a purpose end up lasting longer in the cycle,"" she commented, adding, ""(The balaclava) makes me really excited.""

467,Beauty behind bars: Why makeup matters for prisoners,"Written by Zara Stone

Last year was a rough one for Joyce Pequeno, a 28-year-old inmate at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility in Wilsonville, Oregon. Social distancing was rare, she said, and prisoners were dying . Her clemency hearing was postponed. Still, most days she dabbed on foundation, swirled eyeshadow across her lids and outlined her eyes with kohl.

""It makes me feel good, like a real human being -- not just a number,"" she said over email. ""The cheap stuff they sell makes me break out, but it's all we have (so I use it).""

Seven hundred miles south, Susan Ferguson, an inmate inside the Central California Women's Facility, in Chowchilla, has an equally consistent beauty routine. ""Getting my hair and nails taken care of is self-care,"" she said via a letter. ""Everyone is sick... it makes me feel normal."" But pandemic-related supply chain problems have created cosmetic shortages at prison commissaries.

Many inmates find comfort in cosmetics. Stripped of freedom, friends and family, makeup can help inmate retains a sense of identity and present themselves in the manner they choose, rather than as dictated by strict prison dress codes.

""Women's pathways into the criminal justice system are typically different than men's, and their needs in prison are very different,"" said Jennifer Vollen-Katz, executive director of the John Howard Association, a prison watchdog, over the phone. Approximately 86% of women in US jails have experienced sexual violence at some point in their lives, and 75% report mental health issues -- histories that go hand in hand with substance abuse and coerced behavior.

Despite the potential psychological benefits, access to makeup in prisons has always been politically fraught. Viewed as frivolous or a luxury, offenders have historically been considered undeserving of such rewards. Cosmetics were outlawed in New York prisons until 1920, Nebraska prisons until 1924, UK prisons until 1946 and French prisons until 1972, when lipstick and powder were approved on the basis that ""denying women the use of makeup may lead to personal neglect and psychological effects,"" an American newspaper reported French authorities saying.

In 1998, Virginia's department of corrections attempted to ban makeup, citing its contraband potential. Patricia L. Huffman, warden of Fluvanna Correctional Center protested the ban. ""We're providing an opportunity for women to become better at dealing with the world ... a piece of that is how we look,"" she told the Washington Post at the time. The cosmetic clampdown was rolled back.

""Not giving people the opportunity to attend to their appearance is just another way of dehumanizing and making people feel as if they're worthless,"" said Vollen-Katz, who views restrictive cosmetic rules as another example of prisons overstepping their bounds. ""We've moved away from rehabilitation and become far more about retribution. Controlling women has long been at the forefront in the prison system.""

Necessary innovation

Over the decades, frustrated prisoners have taken creative approaches to acquire cosmetics.

In the 1920s, women inside England's Holloway Prison scraped paint chips off their cell walls to use as face powder and dampened red paper to use as rouge. In 1929, women inmates in New Jersey surreptitiously used pages torn from prison library books to twist and curl their hair and ""pencil(ed) their eyebrows with pieces of wood reduced to charcoal,"" according to a local newspaper report. In the 1950s, wax paper became a hot ticket item when it was discovered that it could be melted down and used to straighten hair or give it shine.

The dining hall provided other resources. Women pocketed sticks of butter and mixed them with pencil shavings to create homemade mascara and eye shadow. In the 1960s, women used lightbulb shards to trim their hair into prohibited bobs (so-called masculine haircuts were forbidden).

Today, permanent markers have replaced charcoal, Kool-Aid doubles as hair dye , clear deodorant for blush and M&M's are used in lieu of lip stain. Vollen-Katz is not surprised by these DIY hacks. ""There is nothing quite like deprivation to cause one to innovate,"" she said. ""I think it's about self-preservation.""

Research suggests that access to cosmetics reduces violence among inmates , a phenomenon credited to the heightened sense of self-esteem that attending to one's appearance can bring. Studies find that inmates with a greater sense of self-worth also reintegrate better after serving their sentences. Even without this data, many penal reformers have seen access to cosmetics as beneficial.

In 1945, Lord Thomas Caldecote appealed the UK's ban on beauty products at the annual meeting of the Police Courts and Prison Gate Mission, a charity that helped reintegrate ex-convicts into society. ""Women are so lost without cosmetics that even in prison they feel a little more disreputable when cosmetics are lacking,"" he reportedly argued at a police meeting. He managed to convince his peers and an experimental trial was instigated: each inmate allotted one lipstick, one box of powder and a jar of cold cream.

As prisons reworked their rules, approval to purchase and wear cosmetics often went hand in hand with arbitrary constraints. In the 1940s, women at the federal reformatory in Seagoville, Texas, were permitted blush, lipstick and clear nail polish -- with an emphasis on clear. ""Attempt(s) to circumvent this ruling by mixing lipstick with clear polish... didn't work very well,"" reported the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

In the 1950s, Canadian inmates were allowed powder and lipstick but not eyeliner or mascara, an approach also taken by New York's Westfield State Farm Prison and Reformatory. ""The girls were going overboard -- we want them to look like ladies,"" Westfield's superintendent, Genevieve Meyer said to the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper.

Cosmetology classes

Outside influences have often played a role in getting cosmetics to prisoners. In 1970 in Chicago, philanthropic millionaire W. Clement Stone developed a prison charm school. ""We are going to get these women to think they have outer charm, (then) they can work on their inner charm themselves,"" he told Sepia magazine at the time. This push was international. In 1973, a German social worker told Reuters lipstick and nail varnish helped prisoners ""overcome a feeling of indifference and resignation.""

The growth of prison beauty schools also reshaped the narrative around cosmetics. The schools' purpose was twofold: They aimed to improve inmates' self-esteem and equip them with marketable skills. Anna M. Kross, New York City commissioner of correction appointed in 1954, championed cosmetology classes. The beautification business was a viable path to employment, she reasoned; in 1955 the US licensed around 500,000 cosmetologists, a significant jump from the 33,246 registered hair and nail stylists recorded in 1920 (cosmetology was not recorded as a single profession at the time). Since then, it has been shown that formerly incarcerated people who land jobs with growth potential find it easier to rejoin society and have significantly lower recidivism rates

Kross' early reforms included a makeover of the Women's House of Detention, a bleak fortress-like building in Greenwich Village. The cells were refurbished and the bars painted pastel pink. Her philosophy: An improved environment lays the groundwork for change.

The beauty program opened inside the Women's House of Detention in 1956, outfitted with curling irons, dryers and electric stoves where Black inmates learned to press, wash and wax their hair. They also received free periodic ""moral building"" treatments, and an additional treatment before court hearings. This was the first time in the New York City Department of Correction's history that funds were allotted to women's education courses (typing, sewing and culinary arts followed). The beauty salon was heavily oversubscribed; its 1965 tally included 2,420 manicures, 1,239 haircuts, 8,627 tweezed eyebrows, 4,427 bleaches, 891 dyes, 4,055 shampoos and 9,082 presses.

Today cosmetology schools are a familiar presence in women's prisons. ""We have a zero recidivism rate,"" said Christie Luther, who founded the R.I.S.E cosmetology school inside the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in Oklahoma, over the phone. ""Eighty-five percent of our graduates are working right now -- in (hair salons like) Supercuts, Great Clips, Sports Clips... many in management roles."" But the pandemic has slowed progress, Luther said. In 2020 her students missed 247 days of school. ""They were devastated... they feel empowered in class,"" she said. ""The pink shirts (enrolled inmates receive pink tees) give them an identity, they're trying to be individual in a sea of orange.""

There has never been an umbrella policy regarding inmates' rights to access makeup in the US, nor are there any specific provisions for people of color. Peaceful requests to resolve this have been unsuccessful; in the late 1970s, male inmates at a correctional facility in Texarkana, Texas, petitioned the warden to stock commissary cosmetic products for Black inmates . The warden refused.

More recent attempts by inmates to guarantee access to cosmetics through legal channels have also failed. In 1993 Michelle Murray , a transgender inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution in Kentucky, filed a complaint alleging that denying her access to beauty products ""necessary for her to maintain a feminine appearance,"" violated her eighth amendment right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The judge threw out her claim, declaring that ""cosmetic products are not among the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities."" In 2014, a similar claim by Ashley Jean Arnold, a trans woman incarcerated in Virginia, was rejected after a warden claimed Arnold's cosmetics might provoke sexual assaults or enable her escape

To some extent, the long-standing reluctance to provide inmates with cosmetics comes as no surprise, considering how often their basic hygiene needs are ignored. Women pay for menstrual products at most US prisons, often forcing them to make the humiliating choice between sanitary necessities or calls to their loved ones. ""There's something really wrong with taking people that exhibit a need for intervention and making life more uncomfortable for them,"" Vollen-Katz said. As of 2019 only 13 states have legislation to provide pads, tampons and other menstrual products without charge.

This petty destruction of dignity illustrates the power the prison industry exerts over women's bodies, explained Vollen-Katz. ""Appearance factors into how women see themselves and think about themselves,"" she said. ""Cosmetics are not a basic health need, but in a system that strips people of identity, policies that tear people down is a mistake.""

While the right to rouge may seem insignificant when compared with other prisoners' campaigning issues, it is indicative of how the system often fails to meet women's physical and psychological needs.

These problems will only have been exacerbated by Covid-19 lockdowns , and even as supply chains get rebuilt, commissary shortages continue to plague prisons and jails across the US. However, for Joyce Pequeno, paroled earlier this year, such worries are a thing of the past. She follows the same beauty routine she had while incarcerated, but her acne-causing products have been replaced by hypoallergenic ones, and her skin -- and outlook -- is clearer.

""It's really important to present yourself as put together,"" she said. ""But I've learned to be flexible.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/prisoners-makeup-pandemic/index.html
468,'The higher the better': Why platform heels are back in fashion,"Written by Megan C. Hills, CNN

are making a serious comeback, with stars leading the Heelsare making a serious comeback, with stars leading the post-lockdown trend for towering footwear.

like Olivia Rodrigo and Blackpink's Rosé were seen sporting similar styles at the White House and Met Gala, respectively. Beyoncé donned a pair of this year's ""it"" shoe -- six-inch hot pink Versace platform heels -- to an event in August, spurring an internet frenzy over the item. (The $1,425 Medusa Aevitas worn by the singer, as well as by Ariana Grande and Dua Lipa, were the second most searched for product on the fashion website Lyst .) Celebritieslike Olivia Rodrigo and Blackpink's Rosé were seen sporting similar styles at the White House and Met Gala, respectively.

""People just want to feel happy again,"" said celebrity stylist Nicole Chavez in a video call, adding that high heels, particularly bright-colored and sparkly ones, are part of the greater ""mood-enhancing"" fashion seen across the board, from clothing to accessories.

However, within the wider trend for statement heels, the pivot to platforms -- or ones with chunkier soles reminiscent of Y2K fashion -- may be best explained after a year of loungewear-dominated wardrobes.

""We're coming out of wearing sneakers and being in comfortable shoes, and so the jump from sneakers to stilettos is a big one,"" Chavez said. ""I feel like the platform, because it is more comfortable, is a great alternative.

""Right now, it's platform everything. The higher, the chunkier, the better.""

But women aren't the only ones wearing platforms. Rapper and singer Lil Nas X often wears them with his flamboyant outfits, while Billy Porter paired his sparkling Richard Quinn gown with statement platform boots at The Fashion Awards. ""Saturday Night Live"" star Bowen Yang spiced up a more traditional facing black suit at the Emmys with silver ones by Brooklyn based Syro , which brands itself as ""femme footwear 4 everyone.""

Syro co-founder Shaobo Han says that the shoes have become a tool for self-expression as people increasingly challenge and blur gender binaries.

""Being able to display that femininity (on the street) without feeling ashamed is powerful,"" Han explained.

A sign of the times

The popularity of platforms has risen and fallen throughout history. Ancient platforms existed as far back as 6th century BCE. Over time they evolved, encompassing East Asian wooden styles worn by Manchu women during the Qing dynasty and the lavishly patterned geometric ones of the 16th century , known as ""chopines.""

Noblewomen in southern Europe would wear these ""wildly high"" platforms, increasing the length of the textiles, according to Elizabeth Hemmelseck, the director and senior curator of the BATA Shoe Museum in Toronto. One recorded pair was as high as twenty inches.

The platform heel -- which combined both a block sole and heel -- is believed to have emerged in 17th century Persia. The style was worn by Persian horseback riders as designers attempted to ""figure out the architecture of the high heel,"" said Hemmelseck.

Once the high heel was developed, they fell into obscurity before coming back into fashion during the 1930s, 1970s and late 1990s and 2000s. Interest in platforms seems to grow during times of ""social unrest and economic stress,"" Hemmelseck observed.

""Why (is it that) during the Great Depression the shoes go bananas?"" she asked. ""Why during the oil crisis and the economic woes of the '70s (are) our shoes going crazy again? Is there some commonality?""

It's a trend that technology company IBM researched in 2011 with a study exploring why heels go higher during these challenging periods, as well as during later crises like the dot-com bubble bursting in the late '90s.

""Usually, in an economic downturn, heels go up and stay up, as consumers turn to more flamboyant fashions as a means of fantasy and escape,"" IBM's consumer products expert Trevor Davis, is quoted as saying in the report.

If there was ever a fantasy shoe, it was the one created by Italian shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo. In 1938, during the Great Depression the designer released ""The Rainbow"" -- platforms sporting a multi-colored sole that were dedicated to actor Judy Garland. They were made with cork as well as colored leather, a material that was scarce at the time.

Beyond being a form of escapism, however, platforms again rose in popularity in the 1930s due to pragmatism, Hemmelseck speculated. Many women at the time couldn't afford a luxurious wardrobe, so investing in an expensive platform heel that could be worn with many outfits offered a way to participate in fashion trends through a ""single outrageous accessory,"" she said.

""(Platforms) did a lot of work, saying: 'I'm a part of the times and so I still am fashionable. Just don't look at the rest of what I'm wearing.'""

In the 1970s, the platform heel once again saw a resurgence, with the likes of David Bowie and John Travolta storming the stage with sky-high versions. On stars like Bowie, Travolta and Elton John, the shoes presented ""larger questions about the (gender) binary,"" Hemmelseck added.

Hemmelsack also noted the resurgence of platform heels for men during that era due to factors like The Peacock Revolution in the '60s, which reacted to the US women's liberation movement at the time by ""looking at other models of masculinity around the world.""

Men during this period were ""talking about this being a revival of (French King) Louis XIV,"" who was known for his powerful, opulent wardrobe. ""Can't we Western men shake off this boring uniform of authority, the business suit and begin to connect with our innate masculinity through how we dress?""

Platform heels have also developed different connotations over time -- and in some cases symbolize sex work. According to Hemmelsack, the ""thick platform, with a narrow heel, (became) this sort of architecture of stripper wear"" as early as the 1930s. Over time, it evolved into the clear Lucite platforms of the '90s worn by strippers and pole-dancers, thanks to brands such as Pleaser, which then trickled into the mainstream in the 2000s as stars adopted them into fashion.

As for the platform heels favored at red carpet events this year, Hemmelsack said the style plays off this eroticism as well as the surge in '90s nostalgia.

Beyond fashion

In 2021, ""dopamine dressing"" has become a widely used term in fashion, characterizing the desire for bolder, brighter, sexier outfits.

Some of Syro's creations -- such as ostentatious red platforms and the metallic silver ones worn by Yang -- have coincided with this trend, selling out almost immediately to the surprise of co-founders Han and Henry Bae.

""We didn't think something as loud as the (silver) shoe we created was going to be received so well, but again, it just shows that people want crazy things,"" Han said.

But the platform shoe is more than just a fun piece of footwear -- it's a form of gender expression, added Han, who uses they and them pronouns.

While platform heels for men and non-binary people have recently become associated with fetish gear, they said, Syro was created to fill the need for ""everyday platforms for non-conforming people... objects that really express how we see ourselves."" Growing up, Han recalled, femininity was ""used against me,"" but the shoes now act as a reclamation of that femininity.

""The ability to walk down the street in a pair of heels, swaying our hips, click clacking (in) these pinnacles of femininity, it's just inherently powerful.

""People want to feel powerful and (be) powerful. That's something I think platforms really make all of us feel. The moment you put them on, the additional five-inch height that you automatically get, you just start to suddenly see the world differently,"" they said, adding they wanted to show ""queer kids out there queer joy is real.""

""Living our life as authentically and as joyfully is a protest against the repression that we've been feeling.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/platform-shoes-fashion-trend/index.html
469,How non-binary TikTok creators are helping a generation find their style,"Written by Megan Wallace, CNN

While up-and-coming gender-fluid and non-binary designers like Harris Reed and Ella Boucht have begun to make their mark, it's also no secret that the fashion establishment hasn't made much of an effort to design for non-binary people -- at least that's if the collection after collection of drab, supposedly ""gender-fluid"" beige hoodies and graphic tees is to judge by.

And while gender non-conforming, trans and non-binary people have existed forever, social media means that they have a new visibility and means of making their voices heard (including sharing memes roasting each subpar unisex capsule collection). However, in the past year or so, TikTok has becomes the grounds for a thriving style community, where non-binary content creators swap gender-affirming fashion tips or simply -- but no less importantly -- freely express their style.

""Fashion is a vehicle for expression,"" said Kate Sabatine, who uses the handle @k8sabz , in an email interview. ""Every day I wake up and ask myself, 'What gender do I want to express myself as?""

Kate Sabatine (@k8sabz) offers their style tips and queer-focused fashion advice. Credit: CNN

Sabatine has racked up over 948,000 followers on TikTok with an eclectic mix of videos that includes queer-focused fashion advice (as well as roleplaying a range of hyper-specific lesbian characters), For them, fashion has been an important aspect of having their gender and identity affirmed.

""I think that over the years, I've gotten quite good at this form of expression,"" they said. ""People tell me, 'I could tell you're gay by your outfit' or will often ask me for my pronouns because they don't want to assume based on my appearance.""

With 6 million views on the #nonbinaryfashion tag and 10.4 millions views on the #unisexfashion tag at the time of publish, there are numerous inspirational outfit-of-the-day posts, advice-based clips with titles like ""outfits with both masc + femme energy,"" and challenges like ""show me your favourite non-binary outfit equation, I will start.""

To the average person, these videos might seem fun but far from revolutionary -- like a queer interpretation of the noughties style blogger heyday -- but for the non-binary community, particularly for people who have recently embraced their identity, they're vital resources. Given that most mainstream fashion stores still divide clothing into ""menswear"" and ""womenswear,"" and don't provide gender-neutral changing rooms, many non-binary people have to take it upon themselves to experiment with their styles in a non-judgmental environment.

Curious about what form this experimentation takes? In one video, user @robinstares mimicks the dress of the queer comedian Chris Fleming, channeling ""Florida grandad vibes,"" while in another, @kyronrizzo appears to levitate through an array of outfit changes. Illustrating a wardrobe hack, creator @maxwellvice transforms two old pairs of fishnets into a sheer strappy top that, as Vice narrates, makes people ""think I'm wearing Mugler when I walk down the street."" For the less crafty among us, videos by the likes of @cgi.vampire offer tongue-in-cheek advice to live by: ""Get down with dressing weird"".

A community-led haven

According to Momo Amjad, senior strategic researcher at trend forecaster The Future Laboratory, a distaste toward the fashion establishment and its norms is partly why non-binary fashion has found such a home on TikTok, especially with a capitalism-sceptic Gen Z audience.

""TikTok (is) creator- and community-led, rather than brand-led, which lends it enormous credibility and authenticity,"" Amjad explained in an email interview. ""Brand-driven resources are often seen as self-serving and therefore not in the interest of the consumer at heart. These consumers are asking, 'Who made these resources?,' 'Who benefits from them?' and 'What is the motivation behind them?'""

This is why Sabatine, one of the app's biggest non-binary fashion creators, says that their fashion videos have the simple goal of encouraging followers to find their own style, without the pressure to achieve an unattainable look established by the fashion elite.

""I hope to teach people, especially my impressionable, younger audience that you don't need to follow trends to look and feel cool and that it doesn't have to be expensive to express yourself,"" they explained.

In some of their videos, Sabatine also explores thrifting, tacitly encouraging those watching to consume mindfully. Sustainability is an inextricable key to their work -- they say nearly their entire wardrobe is second-hand, thrifted or vintage. ""I wanted to help people express themselves and do so sustainably,"" they explained. ""Some of the outfits I wear in my videos cost me less than 20 dollars from head to toe, but you would never know it.""

'Brands need to do a whole lot more'

Like Sabatine, artist, stylist and art director Darkwah Kyei-Darkwah ( @hausofdarkwah ) is also active on TikTok's #nonbinaryfashion tag. But while on Instagram, they post text slides about non-binary identity and micraggressions such as misgendering, their TikTok feed is an unadulterated celebration of non-binary finery: experimental beauty looks, clips of them sewing their own outfits, and the occasional photoshoot BTS moment.

""Where I am now with my fashion and sense of style is that it really is a complete culmination of how I feel,"" they said in an audio interview. So I think it just spills out on TikTok however I'm feeling at whatever given day, at whatever given time.""

Darkwah Kyei-Darkwah, a stylist and art director, says ""brands need to do a whole lot more"" to make clothing more inclusive. Credit: CNN

For someone already in the fashion industry like Kyei-Darkwah, there's one main different between how non-binary people dress in real life and what major brands seem to think of them.

""Non-binary people actually have style,"" Kyei-Darkwah said.

While the artist is not rushing out to buy gender-neutral capsule collections that make wearers look, as they put it, ""like an amoeba floating through the city in an oversized t-shirt and oversized track pants,"" they're also put off by the sizing constraints of mainstream womenswear.

""Brands need to do a whole lot more. What about skirts that, rather than a zip at the side, have three buckles that you can fasten at different widths so that the body freely flows through different sizes?"" they offered. ""I may be a size eight in ""womenswear"" but my butt may not fit into a size eight the way that a size eight is made.""

For the time-being, TikTok has a solution for that, too, if you're willing to search it out: the #sewingtiktok community, a space where individuals can gain information on making and altering their own clothes rather than squeezing themselves into outfits created by binary gender divisions.

While the #nonbinaryfashion community is yet to spark major industry overhauls, that might not be a bad thing: gender-diverse LGBTQIA+ youth are, out of necessity, retooling to start their own fashion revolution. Through positive representation, styling tips and sustainable fashion recommendations, they are forming part of a wider online community providing much-needed support to those who are trying to navigate a cissexist world.

For Amjad, this queer generation's capacity to create spaces to thrive online is one of Gen Z's strengths.

""Social media in general, and not just TikTok, (is) having an education and learning-focused revolution driven by young people who feel that mainstream discourse does not serve to enlighten them or liberate them,"" Amjad said.

470,"The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire: Enter the mysterious world of Soviet watch collectors","Brad Lendon , CNN Written by

With pseudonyms like the The Bastard, The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire, they've banded together deep inside the world of Soviet-era watch collecting.

This cabal of watch aficionados spans the globe, albeit in cyberspace, bringing history to the wrists of thousands with timepieces dating back to the days of Stalin.

Dashiell Oatman-Stanford calls himself ""a Soviet watch nerd."" His friends call him The Catalog.

His website, Watches of the USSR , reveals why. It brings together highlights from his exhaustive archive of around 3,000 pieces. Some come and some go, as he refines and revises his collection. But despite only starting his hobby seven years ago, Oatman-Stanford is one of the czars of historic Soviet watches.

""Why Soviet watches?"" he asks on his website. ""I am not a collector of watches as much as I am a collector of history and culture -- fragments of a life that once was. And indeed, these timepieces have an incredible tale to tell.""

""Soviet watches are functional and utilitarian, but dig further and you uncover a world of mystery and intrigue, color and pizzazz,"" writes Texas-born Oatman-Stanford who now lives in the former Soviet republic of Estonia.

Oatman-Stanford and his Soviet watch collector friends have carried that mystery and intrigue into the present era, forming what they call the Bureau of Russian Watch Intelligence.

Membership of this secretive collectors group comes by invitation, said Ulices Rosa, who founded the bureau a few years ago by connecting people asking questions about Russian watches on Facebook. If you've been snooping around about Soviet watches, he may just find you.

With his Jersey accent, Rosa might have come from central casting for an old black-and-white Hollywood movie to head up a shadowy bureau. The Lansing, Michigan, resident calls himself The Broker, and you could imagine him selling watches stashed in his overcoat.

""I'm the guy who's constantly connecting the others to the sale,"" he said in a video interview.

Other members include The Vampire, in Malaysia, who's up at all hours making watch deals, Rosa said. Then there's The Astronaut, an Italian guy specializing in Soviet watches related to the USSR's space missions. ""A niche, upon a niche upon a niche,"" as The Catalog puts it.

The Bastard, the youngest of the group, lives in the Netherlands. He once found a $1,000 Soviet watch for $50. He's ""the luckiest guy,"" Rosa said.

The Broker, meanwhile, can do things that will make your jaw drop. He recalls viewing the third season of the Netflix hit series ""Stranger Things"" and seeing a mission emerge. His 14-year-old son wanted the watch worn by Alexei, the Soviet scientist on the show. Freezing the frame, The Broker determined that it was a Kirovskie model, made by the Soviet's First State Watch Factory in the 1950s or '60s.

""I went on a hunt as soon as my son spotted it,"" he said. ""I found it within two weeks for about $36.""

The story illustrates just what make Soviet watch collectors tick. It's a hobby that gives them a relatively cheap way to connect with a bygone world. A working, presentable and likely authentic Soviet-era watch can be easily found on the internet for under $100 and in some cases as low as $40 or $50, Rosa said.

And that's what sets Soviet watch collectors apart from your regular horology enthusiasts, said Oatman-Stanford.

""Nobody is buying Russian watches or Soviet watches for the reason that most people buy watches, which is it's a fashion piece, a jewelry accessory,"" he said.

""It is purely for the interest and intrigue, exoticism, the military connection.""

Roots in America

The Soviet watch industry traces its roots to what was then America's industrial heartland.

Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted to modernize the country's economy, and precise timing was key to making things runs efficiently.

""To coordinate anything in a modern world you need reliable time pieces, and the Soviets didn't have anything of that sort,"" Oatman-Stanford said.

Lacking the domestic manufacturing capacity, the Soviet leadership looked overseas and found help in Canton, Ohio.

The equipment and know-how for Moscow's First State Watch Factory was imported from Dueber-Hampden Watch Co., a Canton company that went bankrupt in the late 1920s, according to the city's local newspaper, the Canton Repository . A 2016 report in the paper said that a company representing the Soviet Union's trade interests in the United States ""bought bankrupt Dueber-Hampden's watchmaking machines for $325,000, loaded it onto train cars and shipped it off to Russia.""

Because the Soviets were short on skilled labor, they brought in American workers too, paying them handsomely for their efforts with an average yearly salary the equivalent of $70,000 in today's currency -- plus free housing and travel expenses. One worker bragged that he was being paid ""more than ... Stalin, earned at the time,"" the Repository reported.

With the equipment to kick-start their watch industry, the Soviets also brought in technology from places like France and Switzerland to improve their watchmaking. Victory over Nazi Germany in World War II also gave the Soviet watch industry a boost, said Rosa.

The Soviets copied some of the best timepieces worn by German soldiers, he added. ""Those happen to be the most expensive of the Russian watches -- the ones that are exactly copied from the German military,"" Rosa said.

Using all those resources, more factories were established around the country, and they turned out hundreds of millions of watches before the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991.

'A tank on your wrist'

Rosa said the watches became a symbol of Soviet resilience and pride in a country that had rallied to defeat Nazi Germany and become a world superpower.

One of the most famous Soviet watch brands -- Pobeda -- is the Russian word for ""victory."" The name was ordered directly by the Kremlin after World War II, according to the website of its manufacturer, Raketa. The watches ""symbolize the willpower and heroism of the Russian people,"" the website says.

""There's a sense of grit with their watches,"" Rosa said, describing them as ""robust.""

""You feel like you're putting a tank on your wrist,"" he said, admitting that the military connection is what first appealed to him. But there's room in Soviet watch collecting for those who aren't military enthusiasts.

CS Lee, aka The Vampire, said the military models don't do much for him. He loves designs based on polar expeditions or space flight. These are the pride of his collection of 500-plus Soviet-era watches.

Oatman-Stanford, meanwhile, is partial to the dress styles, with ""simple and clean"" designs.

""I find Soviet designs tasteful and interesting, the Cyrillic writing exotic and alluring, the history endlessly fascinating, the prices affordable and the number of variations mind-boggling,"" he said on this website.

Like Rosa, Oatman-Stanford is struck by the reliability of Soviet timepieces.

""The Soviets built their watches so smartly and so well,"" he said. And they standardized components, making repairs and service easy.

""If a part from one fails, you can go to almost any other watch from this factory and this era and swap it over.""

The rise of the Frankens

While that interchangeability was a convenience in the Soviet era, it can be a headache for modern collectors.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it left an economy in disarray. Citizens looked for ways to get money, and their millions of watches offered an opportunity. Lee said that Soviet watch factories turned out 30 million to 50 million watches a year, and that a Polish contact told him of Russians selling timepieces by weight for as little as $5 a kilogram (2.2 pounds).

Some salvagers dug through piles of watches looking for gold to melt down and sell. Others mined them for parts and assembled them into new watches, which collectors call ""Frankens"" -- a reference to Frankenstein.

In Russia, Oatman-Stanford said, they have another term. ""The translation for this is 'cutlet,' like ground beef,"" he said, ""a kind of mishmash of parts that they've smushed together to form a patty.""

To novice and experienced collectors alike, the Frankens can be hard to spot. Bureau members look for clues, like the words on the dial, the shape of the crown and machining marks on the inner workings. But they point out that there's really no single authority to determine where these watches came from -- themselves included.

While Frankens may not epitomize the Soviet era, they can be just as much fun for the not-so-serious enthusiast, the collectors say, while still giving a sense of the Cold War.

""It seems fashionable now to look toward what is nostalgic, and I think a lot of people are interested in these cool, unique pieces from history,"" Oatman-Stanford said.

And even if an acquisition turns out to be a fake, Lee said, the price -- likely below $100 -- is worth the experience.

'You can never have enough friends'

For English speakers, Frankens and authentic originals can be quickly found on websites such as eBay and Etsy. Some of the dozens of brands to look for include the aforementioned Pobeda and Raketa, as well as Komandirskie, Sekonda, Slava, Strela and Vostok.

To improve your chances of getting a fair price for an authentic timepiece -- and one that will actually show up in the mail -- the Bureau of Russian Watch Intelligence advises paying careful attention to the reviews. Most of the Bureau got their starts shopping online, though once they got serious, they found better, cheaper sources.

Lee said he has contacts in places like Spain, Italy, Russia and Romania who will search flea markets for him, looking for specific watches he wants to add to his collection.

""You can never have enough friends,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Oatman-Stanford, who can repair and refurbish his own watches, said he has established a network of middlemen who buy him cheap watches on the Russian and Ukraine domestic markets.

""I send them money and then they send me in bulk -- 20, 50, a hundred at a time,"" he said. He can then sort the wheat from the chaff himself.

When Rosa wants something, he'll often consult a mysterious figure known as The Oracle, a Ukrainian who only communicates by email.

""The Oracle never talks to anyone in person,"" Rosa said, but ""he knows it all ... There's no fooling this guy.""

Pulling the trigger

After exploring the world of Soviet watches, I needed one of my own. I scoured the web for hours searching for an authentic model.

With some advice from Oatman-Stanford, I pulled the trigger on a Vostok Amphibian, which collectors affectionately call ""Scuba Dude"" for the diver on the dial. The package arrived from Russia complete with Cyrillic stamps and an illegible handwritten return address.

Examining it via video chat, Rosa said my Scuba Dude ticked all the boxes, including the ""Made in CCCP"" on the dial -- proof that, as advertised, it was manufactured in the 1980s, before the CCCP (the Russian abbreviation for the USSR) collapsed.

Purchase a few more of these and I could become a card-carrying member of the Bureau of Russian Watch Intelligence, Rosa suggested.

471,From ancient Egypt to Beverly Hills: A brief history of plastic surgery,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Plastic surgery has become synonymous with the quest for youth and beauty, albeit with varying degrees of success. But the field has, for centuries, been driven by medical necessity -- and it has nothing to do with plastic.

The discipline derives its name from the Greek word ""plastikos"" -- to mold or give form. And while the idea of perfecting yourself surgically is a relatively recent phenomenon, there is evidence of reconstructive surgery going back to antiquity.

The oldest-known procedures appear in an ancient Egyptian medical text called the ""Edwin Smith Papyrus."" Thought to be an early trauma surgery textbook (and named after the American Egyptologist who purchased it in 1862), the treatise contains detailed case studies for a variety of injuries and diagnoses.

As well as showing how the Egyptians treated wounds and bone fractures, the papyrus revealed a suggested fix for nasal injuries: manipulating the nose into the desired position before using wooden splints, lint, swabs and linen plugs to hold it in place. The Egyptians occasionally used prosthetics, too: In 2000, an ancient mummy was found to have a prosthetic toe that may have aided the woman's walking, according to researchers who tested replicas of the toe on modern-day volunteers.

Whether these procedures can be considered types of plastic surgery is a matter of historical debate, according to Justin Yousef, whose research on the topic was recently published in the European Journal of Plastic Surgery. It is in India, in fact, that historians have found ""the first description of reconstruction proper,"" he said in a phone interview.

By the 6th century B.C., physicians in India were carrying out procedures not dissimilar to a modern-day cosmetic rhinoplasty. In a detailed compendium called ""Sushruta Samhita,"" the Indian physician Sushruta -- who is sometimes called the father of plastic surgery -- outlined a remarkably advanced technique for skin grafts.

As in Egypt, the procedure involved repairing noses. But according to Yousef, patients' motives were, in a sense, cosmetic.

""In ancient India, there was a practice of having one's nose removed as punishment for adulterous acts or (other acts that were) against the law at the time,"" said Yousef, who is also a trainee surgeon at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. ""It was a public sign of shame -- if you walked around with an absent nose, people knew that you'd done something.""

Sushruta's technique involved constructing new noses using skin from elsewhere on patients' faces. ""There are two schools of thought,"" Yousef said. ""That the skin was either from the forehead or the cheek. But he basically raised the skin and the underlying fat, before transporting it to the area of the nose.""

Elsewhere in antiquity, the first known cleft lip repair is believed to have been successfully carried out by 4th-century Chinese doctors. And in ancient Rome, the encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus documented a procedure whereby excess skin around patients' eyes was surgically removed

""Celsus described what we today would call blepharoplasty, or eyelid rejuvenation,"" Yousef said. ""It was used when hairs (eyelashes) became inverted and started to affect the patient's ability to see. They were trying to shorten the eyelid so the hairs wouldn't reach the eye.""

In the ancient world, patients were usually ""seeking to replace something rather than enhance their aesthetic appeal,"" Yousef said. And given the pain and risks involved, going under the knife was reserved for those most in need. ""Wine was the anesthetic,"" Yousef added.

The needs of war

Progress in the field was slow over the ensuing centuries. Like much of medical science, it was the development of modern germ theory and the 19th-century invention of anesthesia that began shaping the practices seen today.

As with so many innovations, however, there was another factor that accelerated plastic surgery's progress: war.

During World War I, the sheer volume of patients with facial injuries -- coupled with advances in blood transfusions and infection control -- allowed doctors to experiment with innovative new techniques, according to Andrew Bamji, author of "" Faces from the Front ,"" a book tracing the origins of modern plastic surgery.

""If you've got 100 patients to learn from, that actually isn't very many, given the various types of injuries you can have,"" the writer and retired rheumatologist said in a phone interview. ""But if you've got 5,000 patients, it's a different game altogether.""

The institution at the heart of Bamji's book, Queen Mary's Hospital in London, was the ""first to concentrate all the patients in one place,"" he added. Skin grafts, bone grafts, facial reconstructions and wound-stitching techniques all made dramatic leaps forward.

""You've got literally dozens of surgeons working there, and they can bounce ideas off each other. We have photographs of two operations happening in the same operating theater at once -- which from a cross-infection point of view, nowadays, would be completely forbidden -- but... you have this incredible interchange of ideas and the development of reconstructive techniques.""

At the time, the priority for military and civilian patients was improved functioning, such as chewing or breathing more easily. And the idea of using surgery to simply improve one's appearance remained in its infancy. Doctors in Europe and America had experimented with rudimentary cosmetic procedures prior to World War I, though they were ""hit and miss,"" Bamji said, adding that ""quite a lot of it went wrong.""

At the start of the 20th century in France, for instance, doctors sometimes attempted to re-contour patients' faces using paraffin wax. Although solid at room temperature, when the wax warmed in the body ""it started to melt, and so it sank into the lower regions,"" Bamji said.

Standards improved in the inter-war period, which also saw the first attempts at sex reassignment surgery. But cosmetic procedures were frowned upon by parts of the medical establishment. In the 1930s, some surgeons ""bobbed noses and performed some breast operations,"" Dr. Richard L. Dolsky wrote in the American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery in 1999, although ""such work occurred quietly, without fanfare.""

""Most plastic surgeons yearned to be recognized as 'serious surgeons' and avoided what were considered frivolous procedures,"" he added.

Entering the mainstream

The post-war period saw drastic changes for the field. Improved technology, diminished risk and increased disposable income all contributed to plastic surgery's growing popularity -- as did a surplus of doctors after the end of World War II, according to Bamji.

""You've got all these plastic surgeons that haven't got anything else to do,"" he said. ""Once they were done with all the wartime causalities, of which there were vast numbers, then they can get on with all these other things.""

By the 1960s -- in the US especially -- many of today's most common cosmetic procedures, such as breast augmentation, rhinoplasty and face re-shaping, were becoming more commonplace. Innovation was still driven by the needs of trauma patients or those suffering from cancer or disfigurements. But the technology could be used to vainer ends.

Take, for instance, the emergence of Botox. Originally a treatment for strabismus, or crossed eyes, in the late 1960s and 1970s , the injections were later harnessed by the cosmetics industry for their skin-smoothing properties and were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat frown lines in 2002. (In recent years, innovation has benefited the medical profession once again, with Botox now used to treat migraines and spasms. Just last year, a study found that the injections may help alleviate depression, with the authors hypothesizing that paralyzing facial muscles disrupts the feedback loop between negative facial expressions and negative emotions.)

It took a plastic surgery explosion boom of the 1990s, which saw the volume of procedures in America grow tenfold , for cosmetic procedures to begin outnumber reconstructive ones. By 2005, the number of cosmetic surgery procedures performed in the US was almost double that of reconstructive procedures, according to data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, or ASPS. Fueled by celebrity endorsements and economies of scale, cosmetic surgery also tapped into a new aesthetic of desirability, said Ruth Holliday, a professor of gender and culture at Leeds University's School of Sociology and Social Policy.

""Post-feminist thinking, which first emerged in the 1980s, was all about showing how empowered you were,"" she recently told CNN . ""It was about women reclaiming their sexuality, both from the patriarchy and the feminist movement itself. Within the realm of plastic surgery, that translated into emphasizing all the parts of their bodies that were already widely eroticized by society -- thighs, curves, breasts -- to own and show off their femininity.""

According ASPS data , 15.6 million cosmetic procedures were carried out in the US last year. New technology continues to drive the sector's growth, with some 85% of these procedures (of which Botox and fillers were by far the most popular) considered ""minimally invasive.""

Tastes continue to change, too. And while the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the entire industry, with ASPS reporting a 15% drop in cosmetic procedures carried out in the US in 2020 compared to the previous year, some procedures suffered far larger falls -- the number of breast augmentations was down 33% and buttock lifts were down 27%, year over year.

It remains to be seen whether the so called "" Zoom effec t"" (or ""Zoom boom"") will be reflected in 2021's figures. But a number of surgeons and clinics have reported an increased demand for surgery on those body parts most visible during video calls -- neck liposuctions, lower facelifts and under-eye fillers.

Dr. Sheila Nazarian, star of Netflix reality show ""Skin Decision,"" said in a phone interview last year that, when her Beverly Hills clinic reopened after California's lockdown, ""lots of people came to get lower face work ... because, with Zoom, the camera points up from below.""

""People started thinking about doing things that would make them feel good in the long-term.""

472,Shipping generates more CO2 than aviation. This solar-powered boat could change that,"Written by Eva Rothenberg, CNN

For his first few days at sea on the MS Porrima, Gunter Pauli was stunned by the silence aboard his solar-powered ship.

""When you have no engine running, there's silence. There's a real sense of awe and resilience, and you have a lot of time on your hands to reflect,"" the Belgian entrepreneur and economist said in a phone interview. ""There's a clear feeling of, 'Oh my God, I'm vulnerable -- I better use what I have carefully.'""

Using limited resources effectively is the core philosophy underpinning the Porrima, a concept boat centered on environmental research, which aims to show how sustainable technology could revolutionize the shipping industry.

Maritime transport drives over 80% of global trade, but it disrupts marine ecosystems, contributes to ocean acidification and accounts for more CO2 emissions than aviation each year.

The ship set sail with a small crew from Osaka, Japan on December 18, and is expected to make dozens of stops on five continents. It will complete a three-year circumnavigation voyage before returning to Japan in time for the 2025 World Expo.

Artistic design inspirations

The ship is a case study in sustainability. A miniature farm allows Pauli to cultivate edible spirulina algae and mushrooms below deck, while air bubble nets prevent overfishing by separating fish by weight and then releasing the reproductive females, which tend to be heavier due to their eggs. As well as being largely powered by solar panels, the vessel will soon be equipped with a filter that isolates and concentrates nanoplastics from seawater and converts them into hydrogen fuel.

Pauli believes that design features on board the 118-foot-long, 79-foot-wide ship are just as important as green energy production when it comes to promoting Porrima's environmental message.

The interiors of the Porrima's two primary rooms, the VIP suite and the main hall, were inspired by an eclectic mix of Russian matryoshka dolls, Japanese origami and Swiss Army knives.

With limited room on board, the dolls inspired a series of storage solutions that easily slide and fit inside one another to save space. The intricacy of origami, meanwhile, is replicated in various shelving units, seating areas and tables that can surreptitiously fold into walls like drawers. Lastly, the adaptability of the Swiss Army knife is reflected in the multipurpose main hall, which can be converted into a classroom, exhibition space, library or dining hall.

These three influences may at first seem disparate, but Pauli said they are tied together by the efficient and creative use of minimal materials. He used ideas from each to ""transform"" the Porrima's internals, he added.

""The ship is a compact set of practical tools integrated into one unit,"" Pauli said. But it is also, he added, is inspired by art

Believing that ""a great artist is a great antenna in society,"" Pauli modeled his design on renowned painter and theorist Michelangelo Pistoletto's notion of the ""Third Paradise,"" which proposes a balanced convergence of nature and technology. In turn, the 88-year-old Italian artist, who also spoke to CNN, believes that the ship offers ""the possibility"" of making his concept a reality.

""The climate crisis is the situation we find ourselves in after the evolution of our technology, but the more we are free, the more we advance, the more we must be responsible,"" Pistoletto said over the phone. ""And art is the interaction of autonomy and responsibility.""

Pistoletto is among several artists whose work will be displayed inside the ship, which he described as ""the reintegration of technology into nature.""

For Pauli, this sense of responsibility -- for the environment and communities bearing the brunt of unsustainable practices -- was the driving force behind the project. ""We have done too much analysis (on environmental issues), and too much analysis on the problem often leads to paralysis. I knew that whatever we're doing is falling way short of what is needed, but it's also falling way short of what is possible.

""We can't just improve on what we have,"" he said. ""You have to use your consciousness and creativity to imagine the next thing and the next thing cannot be a mere improvement. So I decided to start creating projects that were considered impossible.""

Mission to educate

Interactive education is the at the heart of the Porrima's three-year journey. At many of its stops across the globe, Pauli hopes to connect with members of the public, academics and industry leaders while teaching them about the ship's design. The main hall, when transformed into a classroom, will be used to teach children about the innovations on board, with the hope of inspiring future generations.

But Pauli also hopes to inspire change in the immediate future, with some of the ship's technology expected to be disseminated through the shipping sector. By 2024, Pauli said, his nanoplastic filters are set to be installed on a thousand ships in the Mediterranean Sea to initiate a larger-scale cleaning campaign. And by 2025, Morocco is scheduled to launch a fleet of ships equipped with Pauli's air bubble fishing technology, he added.

""It's not enough to invent something. Once you've done something unique, democratize it and make it available,"" he said, adding: ""There's a sense of empowerment when you realize that this technology can really be used to help communities that rely on unsustainable practices.""

473,Creating for community: The Black designers placing identity and heritage at the center of their brands,"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN

This story is part of CNN Style's ongoing project, The September Issues : A thought-provoking hub for conversations about fashion's impact on people and the planet.

At 77, Daniel Day has plenty to be proud of. During the 1980s and early '90s, the designer became an early icon of high-end streetwear , designing custom pieces for hustlers, athletes, and rappers from his now legendary Harlem shop, Dapper Dan's Boutique , in New York. His use of furs, leathers, and fine fabrics screamed status for a new type of monied shopper. But the real draw was Day's inventive and illicit incorporation of luxury logos, screen-printed onto the kind of fashion that none of the European houses were yet in the business of producing themselves.

Created in collaboration with clients from his community of friends and contemporaries, Day adopted unlicensed Fendi for Mike Tyson; crafted a jacket emblazoned with interlocking Gucci G's for LL Cool J; and fashioned a fur bomber featuring the Louis Vuittton-monogrammed sleeves for Olympic gold medalist Diane Dixon. His designs laid the groundwork for the brand-backed logo-mania that started building around the turn of the millennium, and has seen a recent resurgence.

And yet when the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) revealed earlier this month that Day would be the recipient of this year's Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award, even he was a little stunned. ""My aspirations for myself, in any endeavor, are as high as I think anybody who's ever lived on this planet,"" he said in a phone interview following the announcement. ""Now, if you asked me specifically, about being recognized by organizations like (the CFDA), I think that would have been pretty far removed from my past thought patterns.""

Day's surprise is understandable: It's only recently that he's been recognized by the mainstream fashion establishment at all -- in a positive light, anyway. In 1992, after years of raids on his boutique and litigation from many of the luxury brands he knocked off, Day shuttered his business. (If Day's supporters saw his trademark infringement as sartorial remixing, akin to the use of sampling in hip-hop, the brands themselves were less understanding.) For the next 25 years, he operated on the fashion fringes, creating pieces for clients like Floyd Mayweather, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, and others in the know.

It was only in 2017, when -- in a twist -- Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele copied Day's monogrammed design for Dixon for the brand's 2018 Cruise collection, that he was thrust into the spotlight. Following calls on social media to credit Dapper Dan for the design and widespread reporting in the press, Gucci clarified that the jacket had been intended as an homage all along, and immediately extended an offer to Day to collaborate. Later that year, Gucci funded the opening of the multi-million-dollar, by-appointment-only Dapper Dan atelier in Harlem, and the brand released a capsule collection with Day in 2018.

Day is the first Black designer to be recognized with the CFDA Lifetime Achievement honor, which has previously been bestowed upon household names including Tommy Hilfiger, Vera Wang, Michael Kors, and Calvin Klein; as well as the first designer to have won without ever having staged a fashion show or sold a traditional collection.

With the decision, ​​the CFDA is also acknowledging a designer who has long stood by a ""for us, by us"" mentality, prioritizing his relationship with his community above all else: ""I consider myself 100% community... You see me on the bus; you see me on the train, you see me walking the streets of Harlem. I do not create from myself; I create from the people that I come in contact with,"" Day said. ""I'm not trying to dictate fashion; I'm trying to translate culture and elevate culture.

""To be recognized globally, that was a super plus, but I started out with my community.""

This attitude seems especially current: Since the dawn of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013 and the rise of social media, which has provided new means for self-promotion unregulated by industry gatekeepers, a new generation of Black designers has emerged on the global fashion stage. And many of the most successful players have placed Blackness at the core of their brand identity, centering their collections on culturally specific stories, collaborating with other Black creatives, and launching social initiatives intended to support, educate, and inspire their communities.

'We're here and we have something to say'

In the United States, Pyer Moss, helmed by Haitian American designer Kerby Jean-Raymond, who recently presented a series of garments inspired by everyday objects created by Black inventors during his first couture show in July, often holds open castings for amateur talent of all ages to model in his brand's campaigns, and provided $50,000 in funding for minority- and women-owned small creative businesses at the start of the pandemic.

Across the pond, British Jamaican designer Grace Wales Bonner has produced collections, zines, photographic series, and a celebrated exhibition that draw on different facets of the African diaspora. Thebe Magugu , the Johannesburg-based winner of the prestigious 2019 LVMH Prize for emerging designers, has impressed critics with collections and short films that highlight both traditional craftsmanship, and lesser known narratives of African history and modern life. (For his Spring-Summer 2021 collection , he interviewed female spies who undermined South Africa's apartheid-era government.)

While injecting the industry with diverse references and viewpoints, these emerging designers are also challenging industry standards about representation and storytelling. ""(A lot of) these brands are also critiquing the industry -- though it's not always in your face -- through their design aesthetic, or their design sensibilities,"" said Rikki Byrd , a Chicago-based researcher and curator focusing on the intersection of fashion and race. ""They're not just saying, 'We're here because, of course, we deserve to be.' No, we're here and we have something to say.""

But where designers of old may have worked on the sidelines of a White-centric industry in relative obscurity, these younger talents have claimed center stage, blowing up on social media, fronting glossy magazines, and picking up major awards. Two of the CFDA's 2021 nominees for American Emerging Designer of the Year -- Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, and Jameel Mohammed of Khiry -- have made Black heritage, storytelling and community core to their company missions.

These efforts can be seen as a direct inversion of the cultural appropriation -- the controversial and uncredited co-opting of cultural elements -- that has plagued the industry for decades. Writing presciently in the 2012 anthology ""Black Cool: One Thousand Streams of Blackness,"" journalist Michaela Angela Davis summed it up: ""We have finally made it to a generation that is bad and safe enough to holla and buck back if you try to take any more of our genius stuff. We are socially and intellectually armed and prepared to claim and defend our ancestral intangible jewels.""

Building on legacy

But while the mainstream recognition of such efforts may be new, the ethos it's rewarding is not. ""These (designers) are part of a larger, longer genealogy of African and African diasporic designers who have been using their fashion as political art, as cultural artifacts of their heritage and their roots,"" said Tanisha C. Ford , a professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and author of ""Liberated Threads: Black Women, Style, and the Global Politics of Soul.""

Decades before Dapper Dan was offering premium bootlegs in Harlem, the fight for civil rights and the Black is Beautiful movement led to a rise in Afrocentric Black designers across America and elsewhere in the diaspora. In the late 1960s, PBS and LIFE magazine reported on the success of The New Breed, a Harlem-based shop and manufacturer of dashikis and other garments that doubled as a hub for Black activists, politicians, celebrities (James Brown and Sammy Davis Jr. were supporters), and ordinary members of the community.

By this point, a similar spirit had already spread through the African continent, as nations gradually emerged from colonial rule. ""If you take a look at African-based publications in the 1940s, and '50s, you can see how much of that conversation was linked to having pride in our own,"" Ford explained. ""The magazines became a place where they highlighted designers from Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Lesotho. (Those magazines) were being circulated broadly then, but because we don't have access to those magazines in the same way, a lot of that rich history is lost.""

In the '90s, Byrd said, this attitude of self-determination and celebration took on new form with the rise urbanwear brands like FUBU (""For Us, By Us""), Rocawear, Sean Jean, and Karl Kani, that turned the uniforms of hip-hop culture into a product that would eventually be found in department stores across the nation.

""Here are Black entrepreneurs who have an affinity for fashion and a particular understanding about industry in general... They're well aware of the fact that (the mainstream fashion industry) doesn't want us here, and when they do want us here, they want to own their terms,"" Byrd said. At the time, many White-owned brands happily accepted the free publicity that came with having hip-hop artists wearing their clothing, but chose not to collaborate with them directly.

""What I find with the urbanwear brands is that they too were taking the style from the streets, but the streets that they knew, the streets they walked down every single day, the streets where they connected with their peers,"" Byrd said. ""I do think part of it was, of course, (Black-owned brands saying) 'We want to be successful in the fashion industry. We just want to be able to do it our way; we want to be able to have control over it.'""

More than a trend

In the high fashion space in which many of today's most talked-about Black designers operate, however, highlighting race hasn't always been a priority. While early breakthrough designers such as Patrick Kelly and Willi Smith -- the subject of an upcoming exhibition at the de Young Museum , and an ongoing show at the Cooper Hewitt respectively -- were both open about the influence of their upbringings on their design aesthetics (Kelly's logo was a smiling Golliwog), neither explicitly designed with racial narratives in mind.

Often, though, centering a brand on race could be seen as a hindrance rather than a benefit. ""There were so many times where Black designers would present a lookbook with all black models, and they would be challenged on that -- but if it was all White models, no one would challenge it,"" said Brandice Daniels, founder of Harlem Fashion Row , a platform that supports emerging designers of color. ""There are so many designers that wouldn't put their headshots on their websites because they thought that buyers wouldn't pick them up, and there was truth to that.""

Last spring, Mohammed, who positions his label Khiry as an ""Afrofuturist luxury brand,"" debuted an abstract campaign video that juxtaposed glamorous brand imagery with scenes of Black beauty, resistance, and mundanity, as well as pain and oppression. ""I want to be participating in this kind of image war, and inject some imagery that's going to frame Black culture as aspirational, but I'm also interested in explaining to the culture why future support for Black causes will be necessary by contextualizing where we are historically,"" he said.

For Mohammed, the film highlighted the tensions between his personal politics and the compromises required for success. Alienating consumers who bristle at his messaging, he acknowledges, is always a possibility, but it's a risk he's willing to take. ""The society that can produce (the campaign video) as a luxury advertisement and buy into the ideals that it ascribes is the society that I want to live in. As an entrepreneur, I hope that we're living there. As an artist, I recognize that this has always been kind of a speculative project, and that, in a way, this might be my own little self-sabotaging impulse.""

Daniels believes young designers championing Blackness and their communities have reason to be optimistic -- and not just because of awards and industry opportunities. ""​​At the end of the day, people are still so attracted to authenticity, and authenticity is something that is rare today,"" she says.

""I think (shoppers today) have higher expectations of what they are buying into, and I mean buying into both on a literal level -- what they're spending their dollars on -- and from an experiential perspective. Am I buying into an idea? Am I buying into a community? Am I buying into something that supports my values as a consumer?"" Byrd added. ""As a consumer, or a person in the world, I'm not making those decisions every single time I do something, but I'm actively thinking about it.""

Ford, Byrd, and Daniels each expressed concern that the current vogue for brands that foreground Blackness will disappear if conversations around the fashion's systemic inequality fade. This, Byrd points out, can have real consequences when so many young brands rely on sustained investor funding and institutional support to stay afloat. However, Ford believes that, regardless of the long-term outcomes, such culture-focused storytelling is crucial to enriching individual communities and furthering broader conversations and race and representation in fashion.

""Quite frankly, we don't know how long this will last, but for the time being the media is hungry for new narratives,"" she said. ""Why would we ever want to rely upon someone other than ourselves to tell our story? To use our aesthetic practices to make the clothes that we feel compelled to make?

""If we're truly in the business of being unapologetic, then you have to take the risk.""

Heartened by the work of young designers like Pyer Moss' Jean-Raymond (""He can make a difference""), and the belated credit being given to Black designers like himself, Day believes the fashion industry at large can only stand to benefit from the platforming of these new, outspoken voices.

""To me, fashion, without messaging is like a container of milk with no milk in it,"" he said. ""The diversity within the Black and Brown community is so enormous. If everybody uses their skills to tell their stories, I think a fascinating world will emerge.""

474,"Even before Covid struck, Modi's $1.8B architectural revamp divided opinions","Many Indians are horrified that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is rebuilding the capital's historic center in a pandemic. But debate among politicians, architects and heritage experts runs deeper still.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overhaul of New Delhi's historic center was always going to be controversial -- even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck.

Since it was announced in September 2019, the $1.8 billion Central Vista Redevelopment Project has been branded unduly expensive, environmentally irresponsible and a threat to cultural heritage. And with Modi's elaborate new private residence -- which comprises 10 buildings across 15 acres (6 hectares) of land -- among dozens of planned new government structures, many critics have dismissed the scheme as an architectural vanity project that serves India's populist leader, not its people.

This outrage has been brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus crisis. Amid a devastating second wave that has pushed the country's hospitals to breaking point, opposition MP Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter last week to compare the cost of the project to the amount needed to vaccinate 450 million Indians or purchase 10 million oxygen cylinders. ""But (Modi's) ego is bigger than people's lives,"" he concluded.

Indignation has only grown in recent days, after it emerged that construction at the site has been deemed an ""essential service"" -- meaning work continues, even as building projects elsewhere are at a standstill. This urgency is widely thought to reflect a race to complete the new triangular parliament -- the project's centerpiece -- before the end of 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence.

Indeed, for nationalists, the building's symbolism lies not only in its design, which alludes to the importance of triangles in the sacred geometries of several religions, but in India's ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects quickly and on schedule.

But while the speed, cost and timing of the development have attracted ire, the underlying question of whether New Delhi's aging government district needs revamping exposes deeper divides.

“ There's really been no opportunity for comments, criticism, suggestions, ideas. There's a vibrant architectural community and very few of them feel like they've been given a fair hearing. ” Shashi Tharoor, MP and writer

Indian MP and writer Shashi Tharoor, a fierce critic of Modi's, has long rallied against the project. Since the earliest days of the pandemic he has called for the government to redirect funds earmarked for the development to help fight Covid-19.

""Why now, at such colossal expense and at a time when the country and economy are reeling from the effects of the lockdown?"" he told CNN in a phone interview earlier this year.

Yet even this most vocal of critics accepted that modernizing India's parliament and Central Visa -- a 3-kilometer (1.8-mile) stretch of New Delhi's central boulevard, Rajpath -- could, in theory, have its merits.

""From a purely utilitarian point of view, many would agree there is a need for some significant changes,"" Tharoor said. ""One is that the parliament building would have needed an extensive renovation to be fit for purpose, and clearly the government concluded that they couldn't do that, and that they needed to build a new one.""

""And as for the Central Vista, a number of the 1950s and '60s buildings, some of which I've had the dubious pleasure of working in ... there really is an architectural case for getting rid of them and replacing them.

""My concern here is the utter lack of consultation before such a momentous decision was taken,"" he said, adding: ""There's really been no opportunity for comments, criticism, suggestions, ideas. There's a vibrant architectural community and very few of them feel like they've been given a fair hearing.""

Fit for purpose?

When work began on the original Central Vista plan in the early 20th century, English architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker envisaged a long ceremonial boulevard akin to the Champs Elysees in Paris or the Capitol Complex in Washington D.C.

It came to be known as Kingsway, and the grand buildings running along its edges were designed to serve a colonial government, not an Indian one.

When the country gained independence from Britain in 1947, India sought to reappropriate the district for its own burgeoning democracy. A statue of King George VI, the then-reigning British king and last emperor of India, was torn down, but the colonial structures were largely retained and repurposed. The circular council house became India's parliament, the opulent Viceroy's House was transformed into a presidential residence and Kingsway was given a new name: Rajpath.

In the decades that followed, development in the area accelerated to accommodate the growing administration. Police barracks were erected, car parking was introduced, and new ministry buildings spilled out either side of the central boulevard.

According to the architect behind the new redevelopment, Bimal Patel, this ""haphazard"" sprawl has corrupted Lutyens and Baker's original urban plan and left the area unfit for a modern government. Designs by Patel's firm, HCP, were chosen from six proposals in a competition to reimagine the area and modernize the facilities.

""You have old stables and barracks that have been converted into offices -- they're completely dysfunctional. It's like an old slum -- it's like a little village in there,"" said Patel in a video interview, referring to some of the buildings flanking Rajpath.

His firm's sweeping vision for the 86-acre (35-hectare) site includes new chambers for MPs, a conference center and landscaped public gardens. The country's National Archives will be refurbished, while the North and South Blocks of the Secretariat Building, which currently house India's cabinet, will be turned into museums.

“ We need to improve the technology, we need space for dining, we need to create toilets, we need to create storage space, and office and administration space -- it's very clear that it can't be done in the space available. ” Bimal Patel, architect

With the creation of new office space, ministries currently scattered around New Delhi will all be relocated to the site. Patel argues this will make the Central Vista a ""synergistic location"" that will improve the efficiency and productivity of India's government.

The symbolic heart of the project is the country's new parliament. HCP's triangular design sits directly next to its predecessor, which is also being turned into a museum. Inside, two horseshoe-shaped chambers will house the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha -- the parliament's upper and lower houses respectively -- while a light-filled Constitution Hall features an adjoining gallery displaying India's written constitution.

MPs will be seated in twos rather than crammed onto long benches, and the new, larger parliament features touch screens for each member.

For Patel, this modernization is a matter of necessity. While the current parliament has been updated over the decades, with new floors added, the old building is now simply too small, he argued.

""It's crowded and there's no more possibility for expansion at a time when we need to increase the number of seats,"" Patel said, alluding to a planned increase in the number of Indian MPs to reflect the country's growing population.

""We need to improve the technology, we need space for dining, we need to create toilets, we need to create storage space, and office and administration space -- it's very clear that it can't be done in the space available, so we've created a new facility next door.""

Ongoing concerns

On Wednesday, two Indian citizens lodged a case with the Delhi High Court to try to halt work at the Central Vista, arguing construction could aid the spread of Covid-19. The petitioners then took the matter to the Supreme Court, after city authorities had ""failed to appreciate the gravity"" of the situation.

This is not the first attempt to formally oppose the revamp. In April last year, eight months before Modi laid the parliament's foundation stone in a high-profile photo-op, a petition was filed to the Supreme Court opposing plans on legal and environmental grounds. The next month, a group of 60 former civil servants wrote a scathing open letter to Modi describing the project as a ""thoughtless and irresponsible act"" that was motivated by ""a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is 'unlucky.'""

The wide-ranging letter went on to discuss the ""severe environmental damage"" the redevelopment will cause to ""the lungs of the city."" The plans are ""shrouded in secrecy,"" it read, and ""not substantiated by any public consultation or expert review.""

The group also highlighted the architectural value of buildings earmarked for demolition, saying that the scheme would ""irrevocably"" destroy the area's cultural heritage.

Historian Swapna Liddle, who has written various books on New Delhi's history, echoed some of their concerns. She highlighted the risks of turning symbolic political buildings -- like the North and South Blocks --- into museums.

""When you say North Block you don't just mean a building, you mean a particular institution,"" Liddle said over the phone. ""The fact that buildings are associated with history, with traditions and with institutions is very important.

""Parliament House is the place where constitutional debate (has taken place), so you should think very long and hard before separating the building from the tradition.""

In a polarized political landscape, it's perhaps little surprise that a project of this magnitude has invited criticism from many quarters. But regardless of the scheme's virtues or shortcomings, Modi's insistence on pushing ahead amid India's worst public health crisis in a generation may see him lose the support of allies he might once have counted on.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/modi-central-vista-architecture/index.html
475,A photographer tells her family's story about the dark side of an American dream,"Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by

For 20 years, photographer Diana Markosian thought she knew her family's immigration history -- or the gist of it, at least. In 1996, when she was seven, Markosian's mother, Svetlana, woke her and her older brother, David, in the middle of the night, telling them to pack all of their important things: the three of them were going to see America. The way Markosian remembers it, neither of them asked any questions. That night they boarded a plane in Moscow bound for Los Angeles, without saying goodbye to their father.

When they disembarked at the airport, the family was greeted by Eli, a pudgy, much-older, American friend of their mother's, who brought them into his home in coastal Santa Barbara. The trip, Markosian was told, was meant to be a holiday. But after Svetlana and Eli married less than a year later (they remained so for nine), Santa Barbara became home.

""When we came to America in the '90s, it felt like an absolute dream to be here. (My mom) fell in love with being an American, she embraced it,"" Markosian recalled in a phone interview. ""I am not sure my mom was leaving anything behind. Everything had already been taken.""

Even before they lived there, Markosian had been aware of some version of Santa Barbara. The 1980s American soap opera of the same name was the first TV show of its kind to be broadcast in post-Soviet Russia, and her mother was among the millions of Russians who made ""Santa Barbara"" a hit , escaping into a world that felt exciting, exotic and far-removed from their own.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Svetlana, an economist, and her husband Arsen, an engineer -- Armenians who emigrated to Moscow to finish their doctorates, and separated before Markosian was born -- were living in poverty, amid widespread unemployment and hyperinflation. Arsen hawked Matryoshka dolls in Red Square and sold homemade Barbie dresses across Moscow to make ends meet. Svetlana assisted him with his bootleg Barbie business, and waited in the bread lines for handouts to feed the family.

But in January 2017, when Markosian was 27, that narrative was disrupted. As the newly ascended President Trump enacted his first travel ban, Markosian, who was then working as a photojournalist for the likes of National Geographic and the New Yorker, began pressing her mother about their own immigration story.

""I just started talking about it and trying to understand: How did we even manage to do this? How did we manage to come to America? And I saw [my mother had] this real desire to tell me, and this readiness to reveal something that felt so shameful, so difficult to tell me. And that's kind of how it came about"" Markosian said.

In reality, Svetlana, enamored with the vision of America she'd seen on TV, had met Eli through an ad she'd had circulated in American newspapers and magazines through a Russian agency that matched Soviet women with American men -- a popular route for women looking to immigrate at the time. Her proposition was simple: ""I am a young woman from Moscow, and would like to meet a kind man who can show me America."" Her first husband had had no idea she was looking to move, and was blindsided when she flew across the world with his children and severed communication. (When she was 22, Markosian and her brother tracked her father down during a trip to Armenia. He had returned to Yerevan, the capital, where the family had lived when Markosian was a child.)

Markosian was stunned. ""You hold your parents up on a pedestal and I think, for me, there was this anger, (this feeling) that this can't be our story. Why didn't I know more about this? Why wasn't I included in this decision?"" she said. ""It's not just us coming to America and living an American life. It's us coming to America, keeping this secret of where we are for 20 years, and of not seeing my father for 20 years. It's completely abandoning our past for this dream.""

Diana Markosian, The Disappointment, 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana Markosian

To help her process the revelation, and learn to empathize with her mother's decision to abandon her life in Moscow, Markosian set out to reenact her family's journey on camera, through a short film and an accompanying photo series titled ""Santa Barbara."" Shot from her mother's perspective, the project saw her auditioning hundreds of actors to play her family members (she looked at 384 women before she found an actor to play Svetlana, someone ""who would understand what it meant to give up everything for this one decision""), and shooting in locations across California, as well as the family's former apartment in Yerevan . (The current tenants allowed her to rent the space.) Ana Imnadze, the actor who plays Svetlana, even wears pieces from her mother's wardrobe; Armen Margaryan, who plays Arsen, wears her father's watch.

""I started seeing it as a story, and trying to divorce myself from my own life,"" she said. ""It needed to be a work of fiction, almost, for me to accept it, to process it, to fall in love with it. Because otherwise, it just felt too, too painful.""

The photos that comprise ""Santa Barbara"" are a careful mix of the cinematic and the personal, fantasy and reality. There are dramatically framed domestic scenes, moodily lit (nodding to the dark Americana of Gregory Crewdson and David Lynch ), and overexposed snapshots, including one that shows her ""father"" holding out a birthday cake, a still life with cigarettes and a cherry-red rotary phone, which looks like its been borrowed from a family scrapbook.

Similarly, Markosian said the accompanying film, running about 15 minutes, ""relies on all these different formats to kind of understand a chapter in my family's life."" Recreated moments from Russia and California are intercut with Super 8 videos and photos from Markosian's childhood, as well as auditioning actors' screen tests. Much of the dialogue is organic: At various points, Svetlana is interrogated by her doppelganger, dressed as her younger self, over the dinner table; and Markosian and Svetlana have their own back-and-forth in voiceover.

Markosian had originally intended for the project to be scripted. She even recruited one of the original writers from ""Santa Barbara,"" Lynda Myles, to pen a script, and gave her family the opportunity to edit it. In part, this was a way to mitigate her own anxiety about telling a story in which she felt like a bit player.

Diana Markosian, The Wedding, 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana Markosian

""The hardest part of this project was coming to terms with the fact that I was the narrator,"" she said ""I sometimes sit with that thought and think why me? I was the youngest person in the room; I really didn't have a voice in any of the decisions that were made. Why am I the one who's in the place to tell this story? ""It was a collective memory, and we all had our own version.""

But finding a version of events that her family could agree on -- from the nuances of Arsen and Svetlana's relationship, to the realities of life in California -- proved impossible. She brought Myles' script to her father in Armenia, giving him the opportunity to inject his own perspective, but when she returned to California, her mother ended up crossing out his words and replacing them with her own. The process repeated when she handed the script to her brother.

""The whole thing is disputed (but) I think we reached a place of understanding that we were never going to really agree on any of it. (The differences were) not so dramatic that I couldn't put out a project, but enough that I started to understand how fascinating memory is, and that if I leaned into the gray, if I leaned into every perspective, I would arrive at a closer version of the truth than just this one version that I called my own,"" Markosian said. ""I looked at the script (after everyone had added their notes), and it became a piece of art in itself.""

Diana Markosian, The Argument , 2019, from Santa Barbara (Aperture, 2020) © Diana Markosian Credit: Courtesy Diana Markosian

""I remember how special it was to come to America, and I never took that for granted. It just came with a very big sacrifice for all of us,"" she said. ""That second chance to remember and recreate a part of your life is an absolute gift, and I think that's what art has given me.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/diana-markosian-santa-barbara/index.html
476,Award-winning photos capture Dutch communities frozen in time,"Written by Leah Dolan, CNN

A fisherman's wedding ring looped around a neckerchief for safekeeping. Buttons made of precious metals to serve as a form of life insurance for the wearer. Sculptural white hats made from fabric stretching up to 10 feet long.

These curious sartorial details, ubiquitous in Dutch clothing over 100 years ago, are alive and well in the traditional communities captured by 21-year-old Netherlands-based photographer Ezra Böhm.

On Tuesday, organizers of the prestigious Sony World Photography Awards revealed that Böhm's series, titled ""The Identity of Holland,"" had earned him the title Student Photographer of the Year 2022. The annual competition, now in its 15th year, also named Australian Adam Ferguson as its Photographer of the Year, with other winners announced across the awards' Professional, Student and Youth categories.

Böhm's aim was to capture a sense of community that he believes is disappearing in modern society. Credit: Ezra Böhm

Böhm's images appear like relics from the 19th century, with solemn -- and often unsmiling -- subjects dressed in traditional Dutch outfits. But these aren't contrived costumes: The wearers are dedicated to preserving their cultural history by donning historic garments to attend church or go on choir outings.

""I started the series by emailing historical museums,"" Böhm said over email. ""After a while I came into contact with some people who are still wearing the costumes today. Once I had (established) contact with them, things went quickly. There are only a few people who wear traditional clothing and they often know each other.""

It took Böhm over a year to research, visit and document these close-knit communities. He often photographed multi-generational families in intimate settings -- in front of a tiled hearth as a fire heated a copper kettle, or inside an antiquated drawing room as his subjects drank tea. Despite the absence of smiles, a tenderness emanates from the images.

""The goal was to celebrate and cherish the old culture of the Netherlands,"" Böhm said. ""But apart from all the beauty, these communities have something valuable in common that we often miss in modern society: togetherness, security and pride,

""Many people today have lost their cultural roots and can feel alienated in a society full of global citizens. By showing these communities to the world, I hope that people start to look at their own cultural roots again.""

Böhm, a student at the Nederlandse Academie voor Beeldcreatie in Eindhoven, will receive 30,000 euros' ($33,000) worth of Sony photography equipment for his school.

Elsewhere in the competition, 18-year-old Vietnamese photographer Tri Nguyen won the awards' Youth category for ""Under The Moonlight,"" a vibrant image of a boy basking in a ray of artificial light. Acclaimed Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky , known for his mesmerizing bird's-eye landscapes, meanwhile won the Outstanding Contribution to Photography award.

The competition's top prize was awarded to 43-year-old Adam Ferguson, whose photo series ""Migrantes"" depicts the life of migrants in Mexico, near the US border. Shot in black and white, the project saw Ferguson subvert the typical narrative of documentary photography by involving his subjects in the creation of their own images -- often letting them hit the shutter. The result is an affecting portrayal of the harrowing realities of migration.

477,Wildlife and celebrity photographer reveals secrets behind most iconic shots,"Written by Jacopo Prisco, CNN

When David Yarrow snapped one of the most iconic sports photographs ever taken, he was, by his own admission, ""merely a fan with a camera.""

It was the final of the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, and at age 20, he was sitting pitchside. Yarrow -- who's since made millions off his work -- had only started taking pictures of soccer matches in Scotland for a local magazine the year before, while studying at university. Traveling to the World Cup as a freelancer, he unexpectedly received accreditation from the Scottish Football Association after he arrived. But thanks to a rule allowing each nation to have an accredited photographer on the field -- and the fact that he was the only Scottish shooter who stuck around after his country was eliminated -- he found himself in a fortuitous spot.

Right after Argentina beat West Germany to take the title, fans swarmed the pitch and the winning team lifted up its captain, Diego Armando Maradona. Yarrow rushed up to the scene and snapped his now-famous photo of Maradona in the air with his arms raised, smiling. The image went on to be syndicated and appeared in publications around the world.

""It's a special picture,"" Yarrow said in a phone interview. ""I was lucky. My wide angle lens wasn't great, but he looked right at me. And it showed the importance of getting close.""

Surprisingly, this didn't immediately kick off Yarrow's career as a photographer. In 1988, he took a job at a bank instead, and later financed his own hedge fund. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, however, his world collapsed. Photography had always been at the back of his mind, and he started plotting his way to it as a career.

""Why would you photograph a bison in the summer?"" Yarrow asked. ""So, I went to Yellowstone when it was cold and miserable -- because they're tough animals, and that's what I wanted to do."" Credit: David Yarrow

""I had financial responsibilities. I had to be a photographer that was earning quite a bit of money to be able to look after things in my life,"" he said. ""So I spent four years working towards the day where I knew that I could earn enough income as a photographer that I could take that risk.""

A life in photos

The tipping point was in 2015, when he took a breakthrough picture titled ""Mankind,"" showing Dinka herdsmen in a cattle camp in South Sudan. ""I knew I could sell it for a million dollars,"" he said. ""It's got depth, emotion, it's raw, it's visceral, and it's still probably one of my most coveted images. And I was right: People pay $100,000 for that one image now."" (Yarrow usually prints his best photographs in two runs of 12 each, and once they're gone, they're gone.)

A 2019 shot of Cindy Crawford with an interesting passenger riding shotgun, taken in Nevada City, Montana. ""I've worked with Cindy a lot,"" Yarrow said. ""She's brilliant. This was the first time we actually worked with each other. You need to tell a story. So you've got the guy behind as well as her and the wolf. You need to have more than one layer."" Credit: David Yarrow

From there, Yarrow went on to make his name in photography by taking pictures of more sports stars, models, landscapes and wildlife, becoming an ardent conservationist. His new book ""How I make photographs"" is a very practical, pocket-size manual with his best advice to make it big as a photographer, but it also narrates his journey from hedge fund manager to fine art photographer -- because even though he's most famous for his wildlife work, he refuses the label.

A grumpy macaque photographed at Jigokudani Monkey Park in Japan in 2013. ""This picture is not even sharp,"" Yarrow said. ""It's not even quite in focus. But the weather was so miserable and dark and it shows. This picture is sold out, but if I found another 100 I could sell them all today, because there's something human about it."" Credit: David Yarrow

""I never considered myself to be a wildlife photographer. I'm a photographer. I never understand why the subject matter that you're photographing tends to then be joined by the word photography -- it doesn't really happen in any other profession,"" he said.

Perhaps his main lesson is the importance of planning, which applies to all of his greatest shots including ""Mankind,"" which was the result of careful staging and, crucially, bringing a ladder to gain a vantage point.

""It was Ansel Adams that taught the world there are two different types of photographers: people that take photographs, and people that make them -- and he was a maker of pictures,"" Yarrow said. The research, the process that comes before ever picking up the camera is what matters, he added.

Another tenet of his approach is that you have to get close, as is evident from that historic Maradona shot, as well as many of his striking portraits of magnificent animals, such as panthers, buffalo and polar bears. Eye contact equals emotion, he said.

""It's all about having their eyes sharp: eyes have got to be sharp. And it's not easy to do with animals like that, because they move so quickly,"" Yarrow said of this 2018 photograph taken in South Africa. Credit: David Yarrow

The book goes on to cover everything from equipment to prints (""Make your pictures very hard to get hold of,"" he said.), with lots of practical examples and a good compendium of his work, which is mostly in black and white.

Above all, Yarrow says, a photographer has to be bold, because the best pictures possess two key factors: that you can look at them for a long time, and that they can probably never be taken again. ""The whole point is to go the road less traveled,"" he said.

""David Yarrow: How I make photographs"" is published by Laurence King.

Add to queue: Into the wild

To enjoy Yarrow's wildlife photography in a larger format, this comprehensive 2016 release collects all his most important photographs from his wildlife work across seven continents.

A hefty book for a hefty project, ""Endangered"" is the result of several years of photographer Tim Flach's work to document the lives of threatened species, including primates dealing with habitat loss and elephants poached for their ivory. The 180 stunning images, often taken on a simple black background, are introduced by a prologue from eminent zoologist Jonathan Baillie.

Drawing from the collections of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, photographer Levon Biss created a unique photographic study of insects. Using microscopic lenses, Biss photographed each specimen by focusing on segments, before stitching together up to 8,000 different photographs to create each image. The result is a spectacular rendition of insects that were collected from the wild as early as 160 years ago.

This six-part documentary from Netflix, shot in locales as diverse as urban areas and jungles, was filmed entirely at night with special cameras that are able to work off the faintest moonlight and in full color, as well as heat-sensing ones that give an otherworldly depiction of the savannah. Challenging to produce, the series -- shot in 30 countries -- is accompanied by a one-hour documentary (""Shot in the dark"") that details its extraordinary technical aspects.

David Attenborough's latest BBC documentary focuses on the world of plants, but leverages some impressive camera tech that essentially shows plants as moving, breathing things. The main innovation is a rig that enables the use of time-lapses while filming the plants, to speed things up while still performing complex motions around the subject or the forest floor, making for exceptionally dynamic shots that show these stationary life forms like you've never really seen them before.

478,The human body is often seen through a male lens. 30 female photographers present a different view,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN New York

Before film was invented, early portrait photographers first discovered the titillating pleasure of exposing images of nudes on silver copper plates. Since then, the male gaze has largely shaped how bodies are visualized in printed media.

Many of the most iconic images of the body have been taken by men -- think Edward Weston's gentle black-and-white photograph of his muse, or Mario Sorrenti's erotic campaign of Kate Moss for Calvin Klein. Meanwhile, less space has been given to female pioneers like Imogen Cunningham or Ana Mendieta, who turned their lenses on themselves.

But a new exhibition at Fotografiska New York features 30 contemporary female artists who offer new perspectives on the naked form as a symbol of beauty, self-expression, identity, eroticism or politics -- and not just the slender female forms overrepresented in media, but a range of cis, non-binary and trans figures of all skin tones and body types.

Linking the myriad imagery is a sense of human connection, from French photographer Bettina Pittaluga's inviting portraits that welcome the viewer into her subjects' homes, to Israeli-American photographer Elinor Carruci's candid documentation of her marriage as she and her husband age.

""Historically the female perspective has been precluded in this narrative of what the nude body means and how it should be shown,"" said Amanda Hajjar, the museum's director of exhibitions, in a phone interview. The show previously ran at the museum's Stockholm location and was curated by Johan Vikner.

In ""Nude"" the body isn't just an object of desire, but a vessel for strength, wisdom and intimacy; a marker of transition; and a site of history and violence.

Australian photographers Prue Stent and Honey Long depict vivid, playful images of women wrapped in billowing cotton-candy fabric, tapping into the magic and vivacity of life. Japanese photographer Momo Okabe takes intimate nude portraits of her transgender friends and acquaintances using intense neon lighting to heighten emotion. American photographer Dana Scruggs focuses on the beautiful subtleties of dark skin and the elegance of the naked male form, both of which are less seen in fine art and editorial imagery. And Swedish photographer Arvida Byström questions how objects and colors are coded as feminine through cheeky, social media-literate images.

There are installations, videos and works around performance too, the last of which includes photographs of Nigerian artist Jenevieve Aken, who rallies against violence and injustice toward women by taking on the spirit form of ""La bella Elvira,"" a 22-year-old Italian girl who was murdered in a village near Pisa 75 years ago, and whose case was never solved.

Overall, the women represent 20 nationalities, with their ages ranging from mid-20s to mid-50s.

""What really stands out is how global this show is. There is a real understanding that Western ideals of nudity are not necessarily what everybody is experiencing in the world,"" Hajjar said.

""We need more African artists, Asian artists (and) South American artists at the forefront of contemporary photography.""

""Nude"" runs through May 1 at Fotografiska New York.

479,In pictures: Photography contest turns lens on life in China,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

A village shadow puppet show, a shepherd grazing livestock and a pair of young acrobats performing handstands are among the scenes depicted in a photography competition shining a light on life in China

Now in its second year, the annual Global SinoPhoto Awards -- which is run in association with the Lau China Institute of King's College London -- attracted almost 2,000 entries from both professional and amateur photographers.

Participants were invited to submit images that ""express, interpret and share their view of Chinese culture"" across four categories: ""Home,"" ""Environment,"" ""Work & Play"" and ""Water."" The finalists, which were announced this week, included photographers not only from China, but also the United Kingdom, Poland and Ukraine.

Chinese photographer Li Huaifeng's image ""The Dancing Dreams of a Mountain Girl,"" which captures a young girl twirling in front of her grandmother, won the ""Work & Play"" category and was also named the competition's overall winner. A judging panel that included artist Yao Lu and architect Patrik Schumacher described the picture as ""a moment of joy"" and ""an almost otherworldly vision of the child in the sun's rays.""

The three other category winners were Yang Tongyu's image of man pushing his fishing boat through the algae-covered sea, Huang Jianjun's photo from beneath a bridge in the coastal city of Yueqing and Huang Qingjun's depiction of an elderly couple standing outside their home with their possessions on display. A further 12 finalists were named ""highly commended.""

In a press statement, the awards' founder Yintong Betser said: ""The entries represent a diverse snapshot of Chinese culture, enriched through the creative and innovative lenses of our talented entrants.""

The winning and highly commended images will go on display next month at the Museum of East Asian Art in Bath, UK.

480,A powerful portrait of motherhood and exotic dancing,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

When Hajar Benjida began photographing exotic dancers around the Atlanta area, she didn't want to take typical images of them performing on stage. Instead, she photographed many of the women at home, including Cleo, who had recently given birth to a baby boy named Andy.

One of Benjida's striking images is composed like a modern Madonna and Child, with the then new mother cradling her son in her lap, eyes meeting the camera. Her mesh top -- a vintage Jean Paul Gaultier piece with the Mona Lisa gazing out -- is nudged up just high enough for Andy to breastfeed.

""Sometimes people forget (they) have families outside of the club,"" Benjida said over a video call. ""They just want to glamorize the life, or the performance they've seen on stage.""

The portrait, part of Benjida's series titled ""Atlanta Made Us Famous,"" celebrates the lesser-credited players of the city's famed hip-hop scene, which has been the launching pad for artists from T.I. and Ludacris to Young Thug and Playboi Carti. Through the series, the Dutch photographer, who was working in Atlanta at the time, turned her attention to who she believed to be the real kingmakers of the music industry: the exotic dancers at legendary clubs like Magic City.

""They play a really big part (in) the current hits that we hear,"" Benjida said. ""(The songs) get tested out in the clubs. When these women dance to it....the audience goes with it.""

The dancers, considered the ""movie stars"" of Atlanta, according to Lauren Greenfield's 2015 documentary about Magic City, have the power to make or break a track through their song requests and enthusiasm for new music. Unreleased, unmixed tracks come straight from the studio to the club, and if they fare well, can be propelled straight to radio stations and eventually music charts.

""The DJs and the dancers are more like A&Rs,"" said Diamond, a dancer in Greenfield's documentary, referring to the talent scouts at record labels. ""We know what we love to dance to and we know a hit when we hear it.""

A single frame

Benjida took posed portraits of the women backstage or at home with an intimate and soft sensibility. Instead of going for the allure of raw sex appeal or peformance, the dancers often appear relaxed but self-assured, gazing directly at the viewer. One woman holds her twins on her lap, while another lays supine with her hand resting above her pregnant belly.

Cleo lives in Stone Mountain, a suburb outside of the city, and at the time, in 2019, was commuting to work in different clubs during the week. Benjida spent the day with her at home, and though many images were posed, the moment she took the strongest frame was by chance.

""Mid-shoot she was breastfeeding her kid and I asked her for one shot,"" Benjida said. ""I didn't even see the photo right away...so I really had to trust in that one shot.""

But seeing the strength in the details -- the similar hairstyles of Cleo and Leonardo's enigmatic famous subject and the Renaissance-like composition, she knew the power of that single frame.

One year later, she returned to Stone Mountain to photograph the pair again -- this time outside of their home. Like many of the images in ""Atlanta Made Us Famous"" the portrait radiates a sense of confidence, foregrounding the women who are the backbone of Atlanta's hip-hop scene. Cleo holds Andy on her hip, her ombre orange hair matching the children's McLaren sports car beside them. But here, if you look closely, there's another subtle reminder of her motherhood: two matching orange toy cars tucked inside the platforms of her heels.",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/hajar-benjida-atlanta-exotic-dancers-snap/index.html
481,A decades-long photography series about girlhood takes a tragic turn,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

In black-and-white photographs, the relationships of several teenage girls unfold through after-school hangouts, late-night parties and prom photos in mid-1980s New York. They are Blake and Leslie, two Jens, Zoe and Molly, applying makeup in mirrors, deep in conversation on the subway and shielding their cigarettes from the wind. Fast forward and they have partners and children, the women weaving in and out of each other's lives like a tangled braid.

Three decades after she began photographing the friends, the photographer Karen Marshall has published the longtime body of work in a new book, ""Between Girls.""

But one face is absent just ten months into the series: the exuberant Molly, who welcomed Marshall into their lives and was the connecting thread between many of the young women. What started as a documentation of girlhood transformed into a more complicated story after Molly was hit by a car and killed while on summer vacation in Cape Cod.

""I wanted to look at the emotional bonding that happens between girls at 16. That was my premise and my intention,"" Marshall said in a phone interview of her initial idea. After photographing the group during their junior year, however, she didn't know how to finish the series. ""I hadn't gotten to that yet. And I was asking that question to myself...in senior year will something be a little different? And then (Molly) died. So that put me down another path.""

Marshall met Molly through a family for whom the teenager babysat -- Marshall was in her 20s at the time and studying at the International Center of Photography (she now chairs the program she attended). Molly and her friends mostly lived on the Upper West Side, came from single-parent households, were ""fiercely independent,"" Marshall noted, and ""had a really good sense of self.""

""They were on their own in a lot of ways -- there was a sense of insecurity, but there was also a certain base of self-definition and style and sassiness,"" she said. In Marshall's photographs, the girls evoke a sense of youthful freedom. In one image, Molly, Leslie and one of the Jens playfully sprawl out on an apartment floor littered with magazines, a coffee cup and a rotary telephone, their arms stretching nearly to touch in the center like a sunburst.

When Molly died, Marshall said, ""it was devastating, and very weird.""

""I really felt profoundly close...to them, and then they're gone. And I also had lost a friend in high school. So it brought up some of that trauma, too, I suppose,"" she explained. It made her think about ""the vulnerability of teenagehood,"" she added, ""where you think you're invincible and you're not.""

'They will always be bound by this marker in their life'

After Molly's death, Marshall gave the girls space to heal, photographing them less, but by the end of their senior year she wanted to be present for their milestones like prom and graduation. In the years and decades following, up until 2015, she reconnected with them as they grew up and began families of their own, taking photographs and recording videos, too.

""What was interesting is that when when they dispersed (after high school), they actually were much more open to seeing me,"" Marshall said. Blake was the first to marry, and in the second half of the book the images shift to the girls, now women, smiling with partners and parenting their kids. In one portrait, one of the Jens is at home, pregnant in a cropped tank top and sweatpants, gazing down at her changing body.

""It's an honor and it's fascinating to watch them grow into themselves,"" Marshall said. Some stayed in New York while others relocated, becoming a pilates instructor, an executive editor, a stay-at-home mom; a deputy CTO for the White House.

In ""Between Girls"" Marshall punctuates the photographs with diary entries, archival images of the girls and pictures of the recording technology as it changed: real-to-reel, Hi8 video and digi cam tapes; DAT audio cassettes; and finally, a thumb drive. Below these images, QR codes link out to the uploaded files.

""They were the only people that I was not scared of showing them who I was, what was important to me....what I needed, what my weaknesses were. I had faith that they would be there for me no matter what,"" Leslie is quoted from one recording.

Jen reflected on just how much she had departed from her own upbringing. ""I think I would have found it interesting (at 16) to see myself now...being married, with two kids, and doing the stay-at-home mom thing,"" she told Marshall. ""There weren't any stay-at-home moms; I cant think of anybody. So I think, I look at Blake and I and it is like the pendulum swung back the other way for us.""

As Marshall continued to resurface in their lives, she noticed how emblematic their relationships were of many friendships, where years can pass between meetings, but the sense of familiarity and comfort comes back at once.

""It's not about time and space; it's timeless. And as I got older, that kept being solidified,"" Marshall said.

Though it's been more than 30 years since Molly's death, her presence is imbued in every page of Marshall's book, as well as the fabric of the women's lives.

""They will always be bound by this marker in their life, no matter what, and then they'll always be connected because of me, because I've also framed them,"" Marshall said. ""Not all of them were good friends with each other, but they were all connected.""",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/between-girls-karen-marshall-book/index.html
